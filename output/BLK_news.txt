© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The president’s corruption is audaciously out in the open, but decades of letting the wealthy play by their own rules enabled him. Dylan is a senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project, where she leads RDP’s Economic Media Project. In his first term, Donald Trump appeared to be gunning for the title of most corrupt president in U.S. history. But after taking advantage of four years on the sidelines to ruminate about how to do better, he’s blown all competition completely out of the water in the nine months since retaking the Oval Office. Trump set off a media firestorm in 2017 by breaking from tradition and not placing his assets in a blind trust, instead choosing to entrust them to his children. The conflicts of interest invited by this farce were met with lawsuits, and #Resistance activists spoke about the emoluments clause of the Constitution as though they were constitutional law professors. Some reporting called this a “halfway blind” trust, which is sort of like a halfway-cooked chicken in that, for practical purposes, it’s a nonstarter. But after Trump left office in 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuits, and Merrick Garland, Biden’s spineless attorney general, slow-rolled any investigations into the former president. Faced with few consequences for this first round of graft, Trump and company have flouted even the appearance of adhering to ethical guidelines since his reelection in November. The presidential transition process was delayed by the Trump campaign not filing internal ethics guidance for the transition team, and the inauguration fund’s coffers were filled with many millions of dollars from donors eager to get on the president’s good side. That panhandling set the tone for the administration. In October, a Trump benefactor gave $130 million to stave off what would have been a major political liability and cover the paychecks for service members during the government shutdown. The office space Eleanor Roosevelt once occupied has been unceremoniously bulldozed to make way for a gargantuan ballroom, also being funded by corporate “donations” from the likes of BlackRock, Booz Allen Hamilton, and tech giants like Apple and Amazon. The sticker price of the project has soared from $200 million to $350 million. To add insult to injury, the donors will likely write off their bribes to the latest Trump event venue as charitable contributions, as economist Dean Baker laid out. The president is working to intervene in negotiations around the sale of Warner Brothers–Discovery to ensure that his longtime supporters, the Ellisons, are able to add on to their growing media empire. And that’s just the past couple of weeks! It’s not for nothing that my colleagues at the Revolving Door Project have had more than enough material for a biweekly rundown in our Corruption Calendar. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also recently published a timeline tracking national and state corruption since January 20. While Trumpian corruption is striking in frequency, scale, and just how routine it is starting to feel, this administration was the logical endpoint of the long-standing tradition of elite impunity. The second Trump administration is a striking monument to governmental misconduct, but the ground was broken long ago, with both parties laying the foundation. For the past half century, corporate and white-collar crime have gone largely unenforced. This was the result of both a widespread shift in views of governance (à la the Reagan Revolution) and a coordinated plan orchestrated to enable private wealth to hijack our democracy, as David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher documented in their new book “Master Plan,” building on a podcast of the same name. Trump himself is a byproduct of the wealthy being empowered to violate the law. Seemingly his entire pre-government career was predicated on getting away with gaming bankruptcy law, committing widespread financial fraud, and racial discrimination. Now, in government, he is employing the “blitzscaling” model pioneered by firms like Uber to break the law faster than anyone can keep up with. The relentlessness of the Trump administration’s criminality is the point; it becomes borderline impossible to tackle any single instance of corruption if two more spring up by the time you finish reading up on it.

Calls for Democrats to find their way back from the wilderness by forcefully rebuking corporate influence and corruption, something we at the Revolving Door Project have been urging as the cornerstone of progressive politics for years, are multiplying. Politicians, notably Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, both Democrats, are emerging as anti-corruption champions. To mount a real anti-corruption agenda, though, Democrats must go farther than just condemning the sundry glad-handing of Trump world. There is no appetite for going back to the halcyon days when everyone knew the legal code was merely a suggestion for corporate titans and the ultra-rich, even as they masqueraded as law-abiding citizens. “ Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules.” The Great Recession was a turning point; the extent of corporate lawbreaking in the financial sector was laid bare. And, famously, hardly anyone ever went to jail. Obama-era regulators, in many ways the acme of our last half-century of the hands-off approach to ruling-class misconduct, earned rebuke and scorn as “the chickenshit club,” afraid to square up against the powerful, if not overtly committed to serve elite interests. Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules. Trump’s first election was, in part, built on the argument that he knew “how to play the game.” In this telling, his ability to break the rules was actually an asset because he would break them for you rather than just for the powerful. It was always a dubious pitch, but it’s understandable why — faced with the choice between someone trying to convince you the game that’s obviously been fixed is actually not rigged, and someone who tells you how they cheat and promise to help you get ahead a little bit — people would gravitate toward the latter. Part of the early MAGA mythos was built on resignation to the fact that our rule of law is fundamentally perverted to create two parallel tracks of justice: an unforgiving, punitive, carceral system for most people, and a cushy, consequence-free dinner party circuit for the ruling class. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged. Dethroning Trump will not be enough to restore real rule of law; the Biden administration is proof enough of that. Donald Trump was excised from the White House with historically bad public sentiment in the immediate aftermath of a failed coup. Under Biden, the Garland Justice Department tried to wind the clock back to 2016 and resume operating the way establishment politicians did in the 1990s and 2000s. It failed spectacularly, allowing bad actors like Elon Musk to grow ever more powerful while continuing to flout the law with impunity. The result was an embittered Trump who faced no real repercussions for his corruption — the worst-case scenario. If and when Democrats control the executive branch again, they will have an even more daunting task after the second Trump term than they did the first, and their existing body of work does not inspire confidence. Business-as-usual enforcement did not fail to rein in corruption over the last four years because of strategic missteps. It failed because it is incapable of rooting out undue elite influence that’s baked into the very essence of the way we became accustomed to enforcing the law. Trump is an extreme example, but he is the logical extreme. As Trump pardons business associates, sets up meetings for his children’s business interests with foreign leaders, and grows his personal wealth, the consequences of failing to hold the powerful to account are more obvious than ever. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged and the Trumpian appeal to America’s id will stay firmly entrenched. To dislodge the hold that corruption has on our government and restore the rule of law, Democrats will need to decide who they really are — and who they’ll fight for. IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy. Jessica Washington Trump ended deportation protections for South Sudanese immigrants, prioritized asylum for white South Africans, and threatened to invade Nigeria.

Title: JPMorgan Discloses 64% Increase In BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings In 2025 Q3 — Details

Global banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase has disclosed its increased exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). In the latest 13-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan disclosed its holding of 5,284,190 IBIT shares, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, as of September 30. This third-quarter figure represents a sharp 64% increase in the firm’s exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. JPMorgan’s IBIT holdings, which were worth about $333 million as of September 30, are now valued at around $312 million. While the bank’s expanded position places it amongst one of the major institutional holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, it still sits behind other firms, like Goldman Sachs, with significantly larger holdings. Goldman Sachs disclosed that it held 30.8 million shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, the filing with the SEC shows that JPMorgan held IBIT call options worth $68 million and put options worth $133 million as of September 30. The increased investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is consistent with the bank’s price expectations for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent report, strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team shared that deleveraging in the crypto derivatives market, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, appears to be mostly over. The JPMorgan analysts revealed that the recent rise in gold volatility has made BTC a more attractive investment option on a risk-adjusted basis. Using this gold-based model, the pundits argued that Bitcoin is fairly undervalued compared to gold and could see a significant upward movement to around $170,00 over the next 6 to 12 months. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,900, reflecting an over 1% jump in the past 24 hours. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still deep in the red on medium-term timeframes. According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is down by more than 6% in the last seven days. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has somewhat struggled over the past few weeks, registering significant withdrawals in the last two. According to data from SoSoValue, the exchange-traded fund posted a weekly net outflow of over $403 million in the previous week. Excluding its performance on Friday, November 7, BlackRock’s IBIT looks set to record a weekly net outflow of roughly $450 million. Nevertheless, the iShares Bitcoin Trust still ranks as the largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund with a net asset of $80.58 billion under management.

Title: Ian O’Riordan: Booming club numbers is not all good news

Rian Farrell was likely caught unawares this week when carving his name into the long annals of Irish athletics history. In registering with North Sligo AC, Farrell helped grow the Athletics Ireland club membership to 75,000 and it’s already tipped beyond that. November registration – when annual membership is counted – has now peaked at 75,078. It may have been a small gesture to name Farrell as their 75,000th member, but this is a big deal for Athletics Ireland, the governing body of the sport which has existed under various guises going back to the Irish Champions Athletic Club (ICAC) founded in 1873. It marks a 7 per cent increase on last November’s registration figure of 70,320 (the first to surpass the 70,000-mark), which in turn was a 9 per cent increase on the peak 2023 registration. All indications are the only way is up. Athletics, like many sports, also suffered a significant drop off in club membership during Covid-19. Registration more than halved in the first 12-month period during the pandemic, from 45,306 at the end of February 2020 to 19,702 at the end of February 2021. Growing that number above 75,000 is certainly impressive, and can be attributed to a variety of factors – not least in seeing Irish athletes enjoy their most successful ever year on the international stage. From the World Championships down to the European Youth Olympics, 21 medals were won, seven more than the previous best of 14 in 2019. In 2016, the international medal tally was three. [ Sonia O’Sullivan: With awards season upon us, Kate O’Connor should pick and chooseOpens in new window ] Role models and inspirations like this will help boost any sport and membership numbers are soaring across all ages and competitive levels. There is also a return of the running boom, the global phenomenon witnessed again last Sunday when there were 59,266 finishers in the New York City Marathon – breaking the previous record of 56,640 which finished the London Marathon last April. Athletics Ireland also pointed to the increased engagement at schools and community level and the rise in the number of athletics coaches trained through its education programmes. Until recent decades, Athletics Ireland and its many predecessors – including the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann (BLE) - were only concerned with the competitive end of the sport. As, in turn, were most of the athletics clubs. Not anymore. It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the taking part, and that goes for the roughly 360 clubs throughout all 32 counties. [ Ireland’s Fionnuala McCormack finishes 10th in New York City MarathonOpens in new window ] Yet, behind these numbers, many clubs are struggling to meet the demand for new membership. Particularly at juvenile level, with significant waiting lists now being the norm, especially among the biggest clubs in the country. That’s not good news, not if any young aspiring athletes are ultimately lost to other sports. Dundrum South-Dublin AC, better known as DSD, is a case in point. It’s far from the oldest club in Dublin – and positively modern compared to the likes of Clonliffe Harriers, founded in 1886, and Donore Harriers, founded in 1893. With 1,200 members, DSD is now the biggest athletics club in Ireland, but not alone in turning away younger members because there simply isn’t enough room. The club was founded 40 years ago, with the merging of Dundrum AC and South Dublin AC, and for lifelong DSD member Gerry McGrath, the first decade or two was about maintaining club membership at around 150. Enough to keep everyone happy, even if there was a struggle sometimes to find that critical fourth man on the club cross-country team. The 1,200 members are now perfectly split between a 50:50 gender balance, all the way up from under-8s to over-70s, and an even half of which, around 600, are juveniles (under-18). There is also that waiting list, which averages about 200. [ ‘Setting big dreams’: Where Ava Crean, Ireland’s newest marathon sensation, might go nextOpens in new window ] “It’s a pity we can’t take everyone,” says McGrath, “but that primary school age is quite intensive, in that you need one coach for every 10 kids. A kid at that age could also be on the waiting list for a few different athletics clubs. Because most of the Dublin clubs do have a waiting list at those ages. “We did have a strategic plan, a few years ago, to grow the club to 2,500 members. But we’re not actively recruiting in any area at the moment, we stalled all that last year, until we could get more of a grip on it. That might change, but we still have physical limitations. Even though we’re one of the best served clubs in terms of our own track and our own running trails.” It’s just three years since DSD opened its own home track and trails off Tibradden Road, just up the hill from its former natural training ground at Marlay Park. That project continues to expand with the addition of new indoor running straight and club hall, set to open next year. As well as the surge in demand for juvenile membership, McGrath also points to the growth in DSD’s training group – now rebranded as the Meet, Train & Race. “That started 15 years ago, with maybe three or four guys, maybe in their late 40s, who wanted to run a marathon for the first time. “Now our Meet & Train is well over 200 members, attracting a few new members every week. We had 80 members in the Dublin Marathon last month. The sport is surging at all levels like that. “The problem isn’t getting volunteer coaches. We have 130 volunteers, some who would do seven days a week, all voluntary, to maybe a mother or father, who helps out for an hour. But it still takes tremendous coordination.” Blackrock AC is another southside Dublin club that is booming, with a celebratory dinner in January to mark its 1,000 members for the first time. On the northside, Raheny Shamrock is developing its first home facility at St Assam’s Church, again to help meet the growing demand for membership. It all makes for healthy reading for Athletics Ireland, as long as waiting lists for juveniles don’t come at the cost of kids being lost to the sport.

Paul Henry’s Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry A painting believed to have been bought directly from Irish artist Paul Henry by the late taois­each John A Costello will be offered for sale at auction later this month. Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers, which is estimated to be worth €150,000, is one of two Henry paintings Costello left to his children. He died in 1976, aged 85. Dubliner Costello was also a barr­ister, attorney general and Fine Gael TD. He was taoiseach twice, from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. James O’Halloran, director of ­Adam’s auction house in Dublin, said they sold one of the paintings “almost a decade ago and now we have been consigned the second”. The previous painting was sold for €115,000. Mr O’Halloran said it “is thought by his family that John A purchased the two paintings directly from the artist as there is no record of them being in any exhibition. The painting is unusual as it has two Irish traditional sailing boats, known as hookers, in it”. It has remained in the family since. Costello’s son Declan was also attorney general, and president of the High Court. He died in 2011 at the age of 84. Other works of interest in the upcoming auction is an oil painting by Jack B Yeats, dated to 1912 and entitled In a Dublin Waxworks, with an estimate of €70,000. Previously belonging to Guinness heir Garech Browne, it hung for many years in Luggala Estate in Co Wicklow. Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry Yeats visited the old Dublin Waxworks in Henry Street in 1905 and made a sketch that he used as the basis for the work. It has a historical significance as a glimpse of a lost Dublin institution, which burnt down two years after the painting was completed. Sculpture is prominent in the sale, with works in bronze by Melanie Le Brocquy, John Behan, Imogen Stuart and Rowan Gillespie. Adam’s pre-Christmas sale of Important Irish Art will take place on November 26 in their St Stephen’s Green rooms at 6pm, and includes about 150 lots. Last week, deVeres auction house on Kildare Street in Dublin saw demand for Eileen Gray-designed items soar. Her famous Transat chair was sold for €10,500. It had an estimate of between €4,000 and €6,000. A blue leather bar stool designed by the renowned architect sold for €4,200; it had an estimate of €1,200. A Jumo lamp designed by Gray was valued at between €600 and €900 but went for €2,800. A set of six rosewood dining chairs by Danish designer Neils Moller made €10,500 - more than three times the asking price. A Svend Ge Madsen-designed Rosewood desk went for €7,000, more than double its estimate of between €2,000 and €3,000. Elsewhere, Adams Blackrock has an exclusive one-off jewellery auction featuring more than 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is closing its doors. Elena McCrory, senior associate with Adams Blackrock, said there has been an increase of “younger people interested in vintage jewellery due to sustainability and price. The price of gold has increased substantially, so nine-carat gold pieces garner a lot of interest”. The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones. The auction will take place online on Thursday.

Title: The forgotten Irish artist: How does an artist make thousands of artworks, then just disappear?

Great work tends to announce itself even without the benefit of hype. Many moons ago, when Paul Finucane was involved in setting up the medical school at the University of Limerick, in 2007, he and his colleagues decided to establish a collection of medicine-related art for the benefit of students at the college. “I came across a painting called Embryo with Gas Mask at an auction house,” Finucane says. A provocative piece, the work had been used, with its artist’s permission, on an anti-nuclear-power poster in the 1970s. “It’s the notion of an embryo needing to be protected from the environment by having a gas mask,” Finucane says. “While it’s a challenging image, there’s no question about the quality of the draughtsmanship.” Its creator’s name was Donal O’Sullivan. Finucane, a keen collector as well as founding dean of the school of medicine, embarked on a little detective work to learn more about him. This obscure artist, he discovered, had been prolific in the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Dublin, he had gone against the expressionism that was fashionable in Irish art circles at the time, trading instead in powerful, elegant and melancholy figurative art that often discomfited its viewers. A prize winner and college activist, O’Sullivan had been a mover and shaker in his early life; at one point he appeared in the front row of the audience of The Late Late Show to protest against inadequate facilities at the National College of Art, resulting in important reforms. Then mental-health frailties set in. O’Sullivan died by suicide in 1991, aged just 46. In subsequent decades, he was largely forgotten by the art world, his work left to gather dust. It was, Finucane says, an unfortunate lack of recognition. That oversight is being addressed in a handsome book about O’Sullivan’s life and work, which gathers together his creations with reminiscences from Robert Ballagh, Vincent Browne, Annie West, Una Sealy and Cóilín Murray, among other well-known names, along with deeply felt reflections from family and other friends. Finucane and Brendan Lyons of Red Barn Publishing, in west Co Cork, who suggested the book to mark what would have been O’Sullivan’s 80th birthday this year, hope to establish him as an important artist. “We tend to gravitate to stories around people who have not received the attention they deserve,” Finucane says. “Donal was someone who was able to argue for a cause but unable to do the same for his own work and career,” Lyons says. “He was a conundrum.” Ballagh, who wrote the foreword to the book, knew O’Sullivan as a young man – he had been friends with his brother – and appreciated his hard-won skill as a figurative artist. “My studio is in Stoneybatter, and opposite where I am there’s a rather large house which he had a flat in,” Ballagh says. “I used to bump into him. To develop the kind of skills that Donal had takes years and years of endeavour and commitment. Anyone who had an interesting face interested Donal. He was fascinated with Samuel Beckett’s face, with Alberto Giacometti’s face.” Born in 1945 in Dublin, O’Sullivan was, Ballagh says, a shy man who was “also quite convinced of what he was doing”. When he was growing up, his parents, Mary and Patrick, ran a grocery in Ranelagh called Lily’s Dairy. Donal was the fifth of six children, a dreamy character who loved playing with his toy soldiers and drawing constantly, taking the greaseproof paper that separated the layers of Coconut Cream biscuits and working faces into the stains left on the paper. [ How did a small Irish architectural firm come to design one of the world’s biggest museums?Opens in new window ] “He enjoyed a bit of craic – as family we’d all have a loud laugh, and we’d sit together and the craic would bounce back and forth – but he was anxious nearly all of the time,” says his sister Marie O’Sullivan, a fellow artist, who also contributes to the book. “Even to go out the door it took effort.” After studying architecture for a year at Bolton Street College of Technology, in an effort to do something sensible, O’Sullivan switched to the National College of Art, then based on Kildare Street. It wasn’t long before his talents were noticed. He won the Taylor Prize twice, in 1967 and 1968, while at the college. Gerald Davis, of the Davis Gallery on Capel Street, offered him an exhibition while he was still a student, and Suzanne MacDougald showed his work at her Lad Lane Gallery. A distinctive presence dressed in black, with a helmet of hair and a Crombie coat, O’Sullivan had a painstaking working method that relied on sometimes frowned-upon techniques. He drew from images ripped from newspapers – a practice forbidden at art college – and would etch on bread paper, the thin tissue used to wrap loaves. He wasn’t a natural agitator, but he’d had the benefit of a good education as a student at Blackrock College, in South Dublin, and was dismayed by the deficiencies he found at the National College of Art, which was using outmoded methods of teaching, and in any case had inadequate premises. After months of peaceful protest, O’Sullivan, a charismatic spokesman for the student body, decided enough was enough. The students staged a sleep-in from April 22nd until May 28th, 1969. “If you want to protest about a situation, after everything else has failed, you just bring it to a halt, you have a work-in. If you want to stop something happening in a college, you occupy it,” he told The Irish Times on June 19th that year. The protests succeeded. In 1971 the college moved to its current location, on Thomas Street in the Liberties. “He’d be shy and anxious and on edge,” Marie O’Sullivan says of her brother. “But he wouldn’t let that stop him protesting. He would force himself to go in and talk to Brian Lenihan” – minister for education at the time – “and be that public if he felt strongly about something”. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries After graduating with an honours diploma, O’Sullivan set himself up in a chaotic studio in an old henhouse in the garden of his family home, on the corner of Ranelagh Road and Sallymount Avenue. A few chickens that remained would cluck over the work he discarded, leaving deposits to which he paid little heed. The hens weren’t his only challenge. The climate at the time was harsh on artists. O’Sullivan was prolific: his studio was crammed with discarded drawings in charcoal and pencil, some of famous names, such as Sinéad O’Connor. Over his lifetime he would make thousands of artworks. But they didn’t seem to offer a vital critique of Ireland in the manner of work by other artists of the day, and he struggled to promote himself, failing to turn up even to his own exhibition launches. He found his main employment as a teacher at Dún Laoghaire School of Art and Design. “Dublin was a grim city,” says Una Sealy, an artist and former student of O’Sullivan’s. “A lot of it was falling down. A lot of the Georgian buildings were either being demolished or held up with girders. There was massive unemployment. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries.” Figures such as Patrick Graham and Brian Maguire drove a particular creative vision. “They would have been the artists that people looked up to in the late 1970s and 1980s. Donal’s work was of a high standard, and it has held that quality. But there was a couple of decades when that would not have been in fashion.” Persuading people to buy art was itself quite a feat. “I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s,” Paul Finucane says, “and about the only thing you’d ever see in somebody’s house was a Sacred Heart lamp and a photograph of the pope and maybe John F Kennedy. To have any kind of original art would have been considered a gross waste of money.” A notice from the Evening Press in 1981 carps that O’Sullivan is “too shy to attend his own exhibition but has no handicap when it comes to putting a price on the tag. It’s a pity, really, that people of undoubted talent gain their exclusivity by putting their work out of reach of the many who have vacant places on their walls.” [ A Syrian artist who took refuge in Dublin: ‘Picasso came to this life to open a door. I hope I can open a door’Opens in new window ] Then there was the melancholy aspect to his work that sometimes put people off. “There’s a sadness to his work,” his sister says. “That’s what hits people. People see a kind of darkness. If I was to show his work to someone who has never seen it before, they would nearly always come back and say there’s a darkness or sadness to it.” At certain times in his life O’Sullivan was on medication for anxiety and depression. He became a heavy drinker. He had lengthy stays in hospital, where he seemed to have undergone electroconvulsive therapy: a handwritten poem reflects on the experience. There is great pain in Marie O’Sullivan’s voice when she talks about those periods. A section of the book is devoted to recollections of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the addiction-aid service where O’Sullivan gave some art-therapy and counselling time. “It was amazing for him to put himself forward to try and help while he was still struggling,” she says. “He was involved in so many things.” By the time the artist died, in 1991, he had fallen out of touch with many of his old friends. When Brendan Lyons began tracking them down, many were delighted to have the opportunity to talk about O’Sullivan and his effect on them. At the book’s recent launch at Cnoc Buí Arts Centre, in Union Hall in west Cork, where Mel Mercier performed an original composition set to O’Sullivan’s poetry, several contributors spoke about their relationship with O’Sullivan, reflecting on his many gifts as a listener, encourager and friend. “I learned so much from him,” Joan Cronin, his former girlfriend, said. “He was generous with his knowledge. I enjoyed the arts, but he gave me the confidence to be critically thinking about it.” For Marie O’Sullivan, who has spent years seeking to re-energise interest in her brother’s art, the attention has been hugely gratifying. “There were so many stories. At the launch, things came up that I didn’t realise. Each person had their own little story of the time they spent with him. I didn’t actually break down – I was afraid I would – but I was very close to tears.” The contributors hope that the book will go some way towards restoring O’Sullivan to his rightful place in Irish art and that curators might pay more attention to his work. “I’d be much more interested in some of the institutions taking an interest in him than the auction houses,” Ballagh says. For Sealy, it’s important that a younger generation of artists become acquainted with him. “Younger artists won’t know who he is,” she says. “He was a very important part of Irish art. What he has done has contributed to what people are doing now. It’s important that this record of his life has been compiled by Brendan and Paul. It’s cementing his legacy.” In a life cut short, the work still speaks, even now. “I’m optimistic,” Marie O’Sullivan says of the future. “Very optimistic.” Donal O’Sullivan: An Artist Remembered, by Paul Finucane and Brendan Lyons, is published by Red Barn; it is available from cnocbuiarts.ie/publications and selected bookshops Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum: How $10B short squeeze could fuel ETH past $4,500

Here are top three factors that increased the odds of a short squeeze on Ethereum. Massive shorts above price on top of buyer activity and bullish sentiment increased the chances of a short squeeze. Only if the current momentum persists, breaking all resistances below the mark, can Ethereum reach $4,500. Ethereum[ETH] surged by only 5% in the recent market bounce after liquidating shorts that came in at the bottom. The market was showing signs of a reversal, with massive shorts at risk of liquidation. The addition of buy orders from whales and institutions on top of shifting sentiment all set the altcoin up for a run toward $4,500. As of press time, Ethereum price liquidated late short orders that came in below the $3,600 mark after dropping to $3,200. Massive shorts were building above the $3,600 zone, while those of latecomers were disappearing. Over $10 billion in Ethereum liquidity was stacked between $3,600 and $4,500, just above the current prices. Source: CoinGlass Based on current market patterns, Ethereum’s price may be approaching a key breakout zone. If buy orders push past the $3,600 level, it could trigger a rapid short squeeze, potentially driving the price beyond $4,500. Because liquidity is tightly clustered near these levels, short sellers may not have time to react. Whales and institutions were capitalizing on the dip as they were accumulating between $3,000 and $3,400. For instance, a Bitcoin insider whale who had shorted BTC just before the tariff crash took a long position on Ethereum. The whale placed a 5x leverage long on Ethereum, with the position amounting to 40,000 ETH valued at $138 million. His closure of the BTC long position was a hint that ETH could rise faster than Bitcoin in the current conditions. Source: Mister Crypto/X That was not the only buy on ETH. BlackRock also bought $35 million worth of Ethereum, as per CryptoGoos. This further supported a potential comeback for ETH price amid shifting market sentiment. Speaking of market sentiment, the crowd and smart money were all bullish on Ethereum. In fact, the informed money was more convinced than the retailers, as the sentiment gauge read 0.23 against 0.21. Source: Market Prophit This was reflected across the entire crypto market, which rose by 1.35%, at press time. All these observations pointed to a looming short squeeze that could take the price past $4,500. However, the charts indicated that for this price to be hit, short-term levels at $3,460, $3,900, and $4,200 had to be cleared. Source: TradingView Therefore, breaking these zones could push the price past $4,500, as all factors were aligning for such an undertaking.

Title: ZCash (ZEC) Euphoria Is Finally Here — Time To Cash In?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. ZCash (ZEC) has been one of the highlight performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past few months. Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

Opeyemi savors his attraction to the crypto market, which explains why he spends the better parts of his day looking through different price charts. “Looking” is a rather simple way to describe analyzing and interpreting various price patterns and chart formations. However, it appears that is not Opeyemi’s favorite part - in fact, far from it. Being able to connect what happens on a price chart to on-chain movements and blockchain activities is what keeps Opeyemi ticking. “This emphasizes the intricacies of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market,” he would say. Most importantly, Opeyemi thinks of any market insights as the gospel, while recognizing that he is only a messenger. When he is not clicking away at his keyboard, Opeyemi is most definitely listening to music, playing games, reading a book, or scrolling through X. He likes to think he is not loyal to a particular genre of music, which can be true on many days. However, the fast-rising Afrobeats genre is a staple in Opeyemi’s Spotify Daily Mix. Meanwhile, Opeyemi is a voracious reader who enjoys a wide category of books - ranging from science fiction, fantasy, and historical, to even romance. He believes that authors like George R. R.

Indeed, Opeyemi enjoys spending most of his time within the four walls of his home. However, he also sometimes finds solace in the company of his friends at a bar, a restaurant, or even on a stroll. In essence, Opeyemi’s ambivert (haha! been searching for an opportunity to use the word to describe myself) nature makes him a social chameleon who is able to quickly adapt to different settings. Opeyemi recognizes the need to constantly develop oneself in order to stay afloat in a competitive and ever-evolving market like crypto. For this reason, he is always in learning mode, ready to pick up the slightest lesson from every situation. Opeyemi is efficient and likes to deliver all that is required of him in time - he believes that “whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Hence, you will always find him striving to be better.

Title: Here’s Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Down
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-are-down/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T19:30:34Z
Full Content:
The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are down today after a brief rebound yesterday. Crypto pundit Nobler has suggested that these price declines are due to price manipulation rather than a wave of sell-offs among investors. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are on the decline today, following significant gains yesterday. In an X post, Nobler stated that Binance, Wintermute, and BlackRock were all selling Bitcoin ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement. This explains the DOGE and SHIB decline given the meme coins’ correlation with the flagship crypto. Nobler alleged that these firms have sold over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and continue to sell more. The pundit added that there was too much market manipulation. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hold above the $100,000 level, which has sparked a bearish sentiment towards the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. The Dogecoin price is currently trading way below the psychological $0.2 level, while the Shiba Inu price continues to underperform, down over 53% since the start of the year. The foremost meme coins are also at risk of a further decline, with speculations that the crypto market might already be in a bear market. Market maker Wintermute recently claimed that liquidity has stopped flowing into the crypto market, which is why the bull market has halted while the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices decline. The market maker further noted that momentum in stablecoins, ETFs, and digital asset treasuries (DATs) has slowed, highlighting a liquidity drain in the market. Notably, companies such as CleanCore and Bit Origin had accumulated DOGE earlier in the year but have since slowed their purchase of the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, Santiment data also showed that there has been a drop in DOGE and SHIB whale transactions, which also explained the decline in the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Despite the recent decline in the Dogecoin price, crypto analyst XForce stated that the macro target for DOGE remains between $1 and $2, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the foremost meme coin. He noted that DOGE has arguably been one of the best idealized Elliot wave 5-wave structures on the macro up to the wave 4 termination point. Furthermore, XForce remarked that the only bullish option left will be observed as an Expanding Ending Diagonal, as impulsive options are now off the table. Meanwhile, crypto pundit SHIB Booster stated that the Shiba Inu price could rally soon as tokens from last bull season are now recording significant gains. The pundit added that a small wave of momentum could send the SHIB price back toward the mid-range, around $0.00001603. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: T Rowe Price’s Calculated Bet: Why the Quintessential “Singles Hitter” Is Swinging for Crypto
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/11/t-rowe-prices-calculated-bet-why-the-quintessential-singles-hitter-is-swinging-for-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T17:26:09Z
Full Content:
In the buttoned-down world of institutional asset management, T Rowe Price has long been the firm that makes boring look brilliant. While competitors chased hot trends and flashy returns, the Baltimore-based firm built its reputation as the quintessential “singles hitter,” compounding modest, steady gains into industry-leading long-term performance through disciplined, research-driven processes. Which makes the 87-year-old firm’s October 2025 filing for the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF seem, at first glance, utterly out of character. Cryptocurrencies? The asset class synonymous with wild volatility, 70%+ drawdowns, and a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to a wall? For a firm that has weathered every market cycle since 1937 by staying boringly sensible? Yet for those who understand T Rowe Price’s culture, the move is precisely in character. Because when Price’s research leads somewhere, the firm follows, even when it means moving ahead of the crowd into uncomfortable territory. Price is decidedly not an early mover. The filing comes nearly two years after the SEC’s watershed January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which triggered what one analysis called “a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows” and have since attracted over $150 billion in assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK dominated that first wave, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) becoming the third-largest ETF by inflows in 2024—trailing only broad S&P 500 index funds and accumulating over $50 billion in assets in less than a year. By late 2025, the landscape will have exploded into what Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes as an impending reality where there will be “more crypto ETF filings than stocks.” Over 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications now await SEC review, covering everything from single-asset Solana and XRP funds to multi-crypto index products, staking-enabled ETFs, and even proposals for memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. (sigh) Price’s filing, which Balchunas called a “semi-shock” from a “top 5 active manager,” sits frozen with dozens of others during a federal government shutdown that has left the SEC with skeleton staffing and no clear timeline for approvals. Yet Price’s approach differs fundamentally from the herd. While most applications target passive index tracking or single-coin exposure, Price is proposing an actively managed multi-asset fund (holding 5-15 cryptocurrencies) that applies its core competency – fundamental research, valuation analysis, and active portfolio management – to the crypto space. This isn’t about being first to market. It’s about being right. “If you don’t start out as a crypto skeptic, there’s something wrong with you,” writes Blue Macellari, T Rowe Price’s head of digital assets, in one of three recent research papers on cryptocurrencies the firm shared with us. It’s a revealing admission that captures Price’s approach: start with skepticism, follow the data, and let the conclusions emerge. Price hired Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, in 2022, not to chase trends but to build genuine expertise. The firm has spent years “monitoring developments in the digital assets space closely and developing the ability to trade digital assets,” according to company statements. Those conclusions, detailed in research by Justin Thomson (Head of the T Rowe Price Investment Institute) and Stefan Hubrich (Head of Global Multi-Asset Research), suggest that digital assets have reached an inflection point. They’re not just speculative toys anymore; they’re potentially evolving into a legitimate asset class. The key insight: while Bitcoin has endured four drawdowns exceeding 70%, each near-death experience has been followed by stronger recoveries. Despite extreme volatility (daily price swings of 5-10% remain common), the asset class refuses to disappear. More importantly, Price’s analysts have identified a potential path from “risk-on” to “risk-off” status for digital assets. If volatility dampens and cryptocurrencies decorrelate from other risk assets like high-growth equities, they could transition from speculative investments to mainstream portfolio components. For a firm built on fundamental analysis, cryptocurrencies posed a unique problem: how do you value an asset with no cash flows, no earnings, and no balance sheet? T Rowe Price analyst David Kroger addressed this by adapting traditional discounted cash flow frameworks, using staking rewards as a substitute for cash flow in the valuation process. The methodology acknowledges that cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks with different consensus mechanisms; Bitcoin uses energy-intensive “proof of work” mining, while Ethereum employs “proof of stake” validation. (No, I have no clue what those phrases mean.) The critical distinction: unlike gold (another non-cash-generating asset), Bitcoin is actually used for real-world transactions. With Bitcoin’s programmatically fixed supply of 21 million tokens, growth in transaction volume measured in USD necessitates a rising price for Bitcoin. This creates a potential return framework if Bitcoin transaction volumes grow alongside the broader economy. Over the 12 months ended August 2024, more than $1.3 billion in fees were expended on the Bitcoin network to support a total transaction volume of $2.4 trillion, demonstrating real economic utility. The crypto ETF filing comes at a pivotal moment for T Rowe Price. Like many active managers, the firm has faced persistent outflows as investors gravitate toward lower-cost passive strategies. The firm manages $1.77 trillion in assets but has been “seeking to diversify into new areas,” according to industry analysts. In response, Price has launched 24 ETFs in recent years—a dramatic expansion for a firm historically focused on mutual funds. Last month, it announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to develop new private market products for retail investors. The Active Crypto ETF represents both a continuation of this ETF strategy and something more: evidence that Price’s research apparatus sees genuine opportunity in digital assets, not just a need to check a product box. As VettaFi’s Todd Rosenbluth noted, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Price’s researchers acknowledge sympathy for the “digital gold” thesis: the view that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against financial collapse, similar to physical gold but with advantages like algorithmic scarcity rather than mere physical limits. But they’ve moved beyond that framework. Understanding value in crypto means “applying alternative notions of utility; it is a parallel world to ‘Trad-Fi,’ with a different lexicon,” Thomson writes. That lexicon includes concepts like decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and token burning, all of which create potential economic value flows. The comparison to gold is instructive but incomplete. Both Bitcoin and gold have scarcity value and bear a cost of carry since neither generates income. But Bitcoin’s algorithmic supply limit (the “halving” that occurs every four years until 2140, when the maximum 21 million tokens will exist) distinguishes it from paper currencies printed without theoretical limits. Thomson opens his research with a cautionary tale about a 1999 stock called Fyffes that jumped 40% in one day merely by announcing a virtual fruit market, then contrasts it with a 2024 crypto entrepreneur paying $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall before eating it in front of journalists. Both stories feature “a whiff of alchemy and transience—that wealth can be created and destroyed from fumes,” Thomson writes. Yet his conclusion is not to dismiss crypto but to separate “the ephemeral from the permanent, the froth from the substance, Ponzi from probity.” Price’s framework suggests that for digital assets to merit inclusion in diversified portfolios, they need an expectation of positive future returns, specifically, excess returns above cash that reward investors for accepting risk. Traditional assets like stocks (with equity risk premiums) and bonds (with duration premiums) have decades of data supporting this expectation. Digital assets have reached what Price calls the “gold stage.” They have economic value greater than zero. The next step is establishing a durable long-term return thesis beyond merely betting on continued adoption or financial collapse. The fact that Price is willing to file for a crypto ETF suggests its research team believes that thesis is taking shape. Hubrich’s analysis is particularly telling: “To formulate a long-term return thesis for digital assets (Das), investors will need to determine whether passive holders should expect to participate in the value added by the blockchain. The answer is likely to depend on the DA, so this analysis will need to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.” This is precisely the type of granular, security-by-security analysis that Price has applied to stocks and bonds for decades. Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T Rowe Price’s ETFs, signaled the firm’s direction at an ETF conference earlier in 2025, noting that “now is a good time to consider bitcoin exposure” and comparing cryptocurrency pricing to commodities, saying it “closely tracks the cost of mining it.” These weren’t off-the-cuff remarks but deliberate signals from a firm that doesn’t speculate publicly. When the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes processing applications, Price won’t be first out of the gate. But if the firm’s research proves prescient, the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF could establish the standard for how thoughtful, non-speculative institutional investors approach digital assets by applying rigorous fundamental analysis to select among cryptocurrencies based on network usage, staking rewards, adoption trends, and value creation. For a firm that has navigated the Great Depression, multiple wars, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and countless market cycles, launching a crypto ETF is not a panic move or a desperate grab for assets. It’s a calculated decision backed by years of research and a belief that digital assets are evolving into something durable. As software engineer Jameson Lopp observes in Thomson’s research: “First step to understanding crypto: admitting you don’t understand crypto. Final step: realizing that ‘understanding’ is a moving target.” For T Rowe Price, that journey from skepticism to cautious embrace reflects the same discipline that has defined the firm for nearly nine decades. The research led somewhere uncomfortable, somewhere new, somewhere volatile—and Price followed. Whether that decision proves prescient or premature won’t be known for years. But it demonstrates that even the most conservative firms must evolve when the research is clear. Sometimes the most characteristic move is the one that looks uncharacteristic.

Title: Consumer sentiment is sinking across the board — except for Americans with the most stocks
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/consumer-sentiment-confidence-stock-market-investing-wealth-effect-spending/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T17:21:15Z

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic. The initial reading for the University of Michigan’s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a statement Friday. The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added. But not everyone followed that trend. “One key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,” Hsu said. The survey closed before Tuesday’s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher. The timing is also notable given that it didn’t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April’s trade war chaos. That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone. The market’s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups. A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers. In fact, a survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic. The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back. Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy. Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May—after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows. “These patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,” the report said. “Meanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Using historical data on funds to make assumptions about future performance involves correctly interpreting the trends. Over the past six years, the U.S. has experienced an extraordinarily unusual period: During the next six years, we will probably experience another bear market and modest to moderate inflation. Interest rates are likely to continue falling in the short-term, but not as low as the decade following the financial crisis because of less Quantitative Easing and higher deficits and national debt. High valuations are a headwind to equity returns, and high interest rates are a tailwind for bond returns. In January 2020, before the start of the COVID bar market, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was an elevated 26 and is currently 31. I believe that the full COVID Cycle from January 2020 to December 2021 and 2025 are more representative of market conditions for the next six years than the period from January 2022 to December 2024. In this article, I explore how alternative investments and mixed asset funds with flexible strategies can be used to develop a conservative portfolio. To evaluate funds, I selected thirty-six funds in twenty-three different Lipper Categories that had good risk-adjusted performance during the full COVID cycle and 2025. I created an optimizer using Excel Solver to maximize the Martin Ratio for the full COVID cycle with constraints for portfolio concentration, minimum returns, drawdowns, yields, allocation to “junk bonds”, and consistency across the individual years and bear markets. Figure #1 shows the performance during the past four bear markets by allocation to stocks for all of the 461 mixed asset funds in the Lipper global dataset with at least six years of history. Note that the severity of the bear market has a larger impact on the portfolio performance than the of the stock to bond ratio. The two black dashed lines show a range of likely maximum downturns for the three bear markets, excluding the dotcom bear market, which was associated with a mild recession. The three maroon squares are the maximum drawdowns of the “Conservative” and “Moderate” portfolios that I created and the target portfolio that I described last month in Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control. The two portfolios created for this article had low to average drawdowns. Figure #1: Mixed Asset Fund Drawdowns During Four Bear Markets Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #1 shows the average annualized returns over the past six years for the mixed asset funds and the “Conservative”, “Moderate”, and original target portfolio. The two new portfolios outperformed both the mixed asset funds and the original target portfolio. Table #1: Mixed Asset Fund Returns for Past Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I am currently reading “A Crash Course on Crises: Macroeconomic Concepts for Run-Ups, Collapses, and Recoveries” by Princeton University economics professor Markus K. Brunnermeier and London School of Economics professor Ricardo Reis, which researches the interrelationship between financial markets and the economy during a crisis. They describe part of their audience to be “members of the informed public wanting to absorb some of the concepts that should be guiding both macroeconomic and financial policy.” The book contains some wonderful insights into investing behavior, such as “Why don’t other, more sophisticated investors, lean against the bubble, preventing it from arising in the first place?” They continue, “These investors try to forecast how long the bubble will persist, which is governed by the trading behavior of the other (sophisticated) investors.” I have no illusions that I can predict the behavior of other sophisticated investors. As described by Hyman Minsky, many crises are preceded by some type of innovation (such as artificial intelligence) followed by long periods of price increases, speculation, and leverage. These are followed by a period of instability and traders becoming risk-averse and de-leveraging. Stock market price-to-earnings ratios were around 18 before the 1929 stock market crash, peaked at 34 prior to the bursting of the dotcom bubble, hit 21 prior to the start of the financial crisis, and are now at an elevated 31. There are usually “triggering events” that set off chain reactions between asset markets and financial markets that determine the severity of corrections and whether a macro-financial crisis results. At the National Association for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, “When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.” The stage is set for a correction, and there are plenty of potential “triggering events” such as a slowing economy, rising inflation, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risk. Figure #2 represents the investing environment for the past six years. Fiscal and monetary stimulus contained the economic fallout from the COVID bear market lasting from January 2020 through March of that year, but Personal Consumption Price inflation rose from a half percent following the COVID bear market to nearly seven percent by January 2022. Charles Boccadoro described The Great Normalization (TGN) in which interest rates normalized to higher rates, hurting bond performance. The TGN bear market lasted from January 2022 to September of that year. By December 2023, the price-to-earnings ratio had crossed the high valuation level of $25 per dollar of earnings. The debasement trade is partly the result of investors and global central banks buying gold and the increased acceptance of cryptocurrency. I believe that the dollar will weaken but not be replaced as the global reserve currency, and the debasement trade is overbought. Figure #2: The COVID and Great Normalization Full Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The full COVID Cycle was from January 2020 to December 2021 and includes the COVID bear market and inflation. I expect cycles of bear markets and inflation to be more frequent in the coming decade than in the decade following the financial crisis. Rates are high, so “The Great Normalization” of rising rates is unlikely to occur to such extremes for many years. Finally, valuations are currently high and more likely to fall than rise either over time or in a correction with a “triggering event”. I set up my Excel optimizer for both the Conservative and Moderate portfolios to maximize the Martin Ratio for the January 2020 to December 2021 period by changing allocations to 36 funds with constraints that I wanted to have drawdowns of less than nine percent for both the COVID and TGN bear markets. Maximum allocations were set for Alternative, Bond, Equity, and Mixed Asset fund types to ensure diversification. The Conservative portfolio has additional constraints of having yields at least 4% with less than 13% allocated to lower quality “junk bonds”. Figure #3 contains the inflation-adjusted results from Portfolio Visualizer assuming 4% annual withdrawals for the Conservative, Moderate, and Original Target Portfolio compared to the Fidelity Asset Manager 40% (FFANX), which is a good global mixed asset fund. The link is provided here. The Conservative and Moderate portfolios had similar returns through 2023, with the Moderate portfolio having higher volatility. Both beat inflation over the six years after adjusting for withdrawals. During the period of rising valuations and the debasement trade, the Moderate Portfolio has outperformed. Both outperformed the Original Target Portfolio from my last article because of a wider selection of funds under consideration, improvements in methodology, and an increase in the maximum allocation for a fund from 10% to 15%. All three outperformed the 40/60 baseline fund, which was negatively impacted during the rising rates period. Figure #3: Conservative and Moderate Portfolio Growth – Six Years Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #2 contains the resulting allocations with the funds sorted from the lowest Ulcer Ratio over the past six years to the highest. I own shares in FPFIX/FFIRX, PCBAX, PMAIX, PZRMX, and AVALX. It will take a couple of years to fill out the rest of the portfolio, depending upon cash flows, and I will lean towards the less risky funds next.

Table #3 contains the portfolio metrics for the period May 2019 to September 2025 from Portfolio Visualizer. Annualized returns are after withdrawals, while Time-Weighted Rate of Return reflects investment performance. Table #3: Portfolio Performance Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #4 contains the metrics and ratings from MFO for the funds for the past six years. They are sorted from the lowest Ulcer Index, which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns from the lowest to the highest. MFO Risk is based on the Ulcer Index comparing all funds, while the Ulcer Rating is for funds within the same category peers. Martin Ratio is the risk-free return divided by the Ulcer Index. The MFO Rating is based on the Martin Ratio for funds within the same Lipper Category. The Batting Average Rating (BA) is based on the percentage of the months that a fund beat its peers. One takeaway is that some of the funds outperformed during down markets but lagged peers overall. Table #4: Fund Metrix – Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Optimization depends on having funds with low correlations to each other. Notice that some funds had their maximum drawdowns during the COVID (2020) bear market, and some had them during the Great Normalization (2022) bear market. Table #5 shows how the funds performed in each of the bear markets and the bull markets. The lower-risk funds provide some safety during downturns, while the riskier funds provide growth potential. Blue shaded cells indicate the best performers, and red are the worst performers. Table #5: Fund Performance During COVID and Great Normalization Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Columbia Thermostat bases its stock to bond allocation on valuations. During the financial crisis, the strategy was to invest in all stocks or bonds, and it did not perform well. It has improved its strategy to have a range of allocations depending on price levels and performed well during the COVID bear market. The Fact Sheet indicates that the fund is currently 70% invested in fixed income and 30% invested in equity. It contains the allocation to stocks by the S&P 500 level. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PBAIX, PCBAX) is an Alternative Global Macro fund that has performed well since the 2008 financial crisis, but during the financial crisis fell nearly 27% in 2008 and returned 26% in 2009. I own shares in PCBAX, but limit allocations to alternatives because they use derivatives, which can be less predictable during a crisis. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) is another good Alternative Global Macro fund that had a maximum drawdown of 7% during the financial crisis. I included it in the original target portfolio from last month. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) is based on the concepts developed by Harry Browne in the 1980s to provide steady, long-term growth with low volatility without trying to time the market. The fund managers describe Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) as, “Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.” It invests fixed percentages of its net assets in dollar assets (35%), gold (20%), aggressive growth stocks (15%), real estate and natural resource stocks (15%), Swiss Franc assets (10%), and silver (5%). The PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) is described by the fund managers as “By investing in a blend of inflation-related asset classes, the fund seeks to help preserve and grow purchasing power, enhance portfolio diversification, and guard against market shocks across varying inflation environments.” It currently has a composition of Inflation Linked Bonds 68%), Commodities (22%), Currencies (15%), REITS (10%), and Precious Metals (10%). I own shares in PZRMX. Figure #4 contains some of the funds that did well during 2020 to 2022 with high inflation. These are mostly in the Flexible Portfolio Lipper Category plus DIVO in equity income, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX, maroon line) in the Alternative Global Macro category, and the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX, red line) in the Flexible Portfolio Category. During the period in between the bear markets, the S&P 500 rose 89% while core bonds rose a paltry 2.5%. Figure #4: Fund Performance During Inflation (2020 – 2022) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset and St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. From 2012 through 2019, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) had very similar performance. From 2019 through 2021, PRPFX outperformed PZRMX and greatly outperformed starting in 2023. I prefer owning PRPFX and PZRMX to directly owning gold because it is much more volatile. Over the past year, I decreased my allocation to stock from 65% to 50% which is a small decrease in risk. Rebalancing during high market valuations and downturns is a modest way of “buying low and selling high”. I believe that risk risk-adjusted performance of bonds to be greater than equities for the next few years. Using the bucket approach to match risk assets with spending needs and using bond ladders does more to reduce portfolio risk than lowering the allocation to stocks. As a qualifier, I use financial advisors to manage the majority of my portfolio using a traditional, globally diversified 60/40 portfolio. I am developing this “Conservative Portfolio” strategy for a subset of the portfolio that I manage in addition to traditional bond funds and bond ladders to have liquidity available in any market condition, and with some growth potential.

Title: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is Dead, Here’s Why Bull Run is Not Over

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bitcoin price has seen a significant pivot from its historic 4-year cycle that is supported by halving events. Science Author, Shanaka Anslem Perera, on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has pivoted from its historic 4-year cycle, which is driven by halving events. As a result of this shift, the coin’s traditional playbook of significant positive momentum has now become obsolete. Still, the crypto enthusiast does not think that Bitcoin’s bull run is over. Historically, Bitcoin’s performance has followed a four-year cycle, largely driven by halving events, which result in a reduction in the block reward. At every point in this cycle, the crypto ecosystem experienced a massive bull run, followed by sharp price corrections. Fast forward to the present day, and there seems to be a notable shift that has now rendered this traditional playbook obsolete. On October 6, 2025, Crypto Twitter declared Bitcoin’s cycle peak at $126,270. Then this was followed by a 21% drop in the coin’s price levels. BITCOIN’S 4-YEAR CYCLE JUST DIED AND NOBODY NOTICED Crypto Twitter exploded calling October 6th the cycle peak. Eighty-four percent crashes incoming. Bear market confirmed. Pack it up. Except the math says they are catastrophically wrong. Every indicator that called previous… pic.twitter.com/b6sj1kGn5e — Shanaka Anslem Perera ⚡ (@shanaka86) November 8, 2025 As a result, several influencers and analysts, armed with historical patterns, predicted an 84% crash and a prolonged bear market. However, Perera believes that there may be a different story to tell. There may still be hope, as he claims that the bull run is far from over. Apparently, key indicators such as the Pi Cycle, MVRV Z-Score, and Puell Multiple, which would usually signal the onset of a bull run, are unusually quiet. According to these metrics, the crypto market is in a mid-cycle consolidation, and not the end of the road. Perera believes that Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may have played a vital role in redirecting the four-year cycle. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed a staggering $64 billion, with giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and corporate treasuries acting as a vacuum for every whale dump. The influx of institutional investors into the sector may have rid Bitcoin of certain rollercoasters. On November 4, Coinspeaker reported that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of up to $186.5 million, led entirely by BlackRock’s IBIT. Within the last six days leading up to November 7, there were consistent outflows totaling $660 million. Within the last 24 hours, the sector has seen up to $240 million flood back into ETFs. In the wake of this situation, the Bitcoin price has recovered by 2.38% and is currently trading at $101,997.13. Consequently, Market experts have concluded that settlement, not sentiment, now governs Bitcoin’s price. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: ‘Sell Your House, Clothes And Buy XRP’ — Solana Exec’s Wild Advice Goes Viral

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana Foundation manager Vibhu Norby jumped into a heated XRP discussion on X, adding a sharp dose of humor to an already intense online conversation. The debate began when Tradeship University founder Cameron Scrubs urged followers to sell all their other crypto assets and buy XRP. Scrubs, known for extreme XRP optimism, previously predicted that XRP would surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum within five years. He reignited that vision this week, telling investors to sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash, and Dogecoin — essentially, “sell everything” — and move into XRP. The statement quickly went viral, drawing reactions from multiple crypto communities. X user Caspian responded, saying it wasn’t meant literally. He added that the point was to align belief with action — if investors truly see value in XRP, they should act with conviction. “Own your stack, protect it, and stay ready,” he wrote. Sell your house. Sell your bed. Sell your kids. Sell your cardboard box. Sell your clothes. Buy XRP. — vibhu (@vibhu) November 7, 2025 Vibhu Norby joined the thread with satire. He joked, “Sell your house, bed, kids, cardboard box, clothes, and buy XRP,” making it clear he was mocking the hype rather than endorsing it. Another user, Slorg, claimed he had already gone all in and asked what step to take next. Norby replied that the next move was to wait for major firms like BlackRock and Mastercard to tokenize trillions in assets, potentially sending XRP to $1,000. Despite the humor, the exchange highlighted the community’s real optimism about institutional involvement and the possibility of massive price growth. Ripple added fuel to the discussion by announcing a $500 million funding round at its Swell 2025 event. Investors included Galaxy Digital, Fortress, Brevan Howard, and Pantera Capital. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the investment confirmed faith in a business “built on the foundation of XRP.” Reports also showed Ripple partnered with Mastercard to use RLUSD on XRPL for fiat settlement, while Ripple Prime is integrating XRP for institutional transfers. These developments gave long-term holders more reason to stay confident in XRP. Holding XRP is the hardest part because conviction gets tested in every wave of volatility. But when you understand the fundamentals, the liquidity infrastructure @Ripple is building and how $XRP underpins the next phase of global settlement, patience becomes your leverage. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 5, 2025 Meanwhile, Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, acknowledges that it is a constant emotional struggle holding XRP. He explains how investor patience is tested in every market cycle, and the challenge of remaining dedicated to your investment when the price moves materially can be one of the hardest things to do as an XRP holder. Engineer Vincent Van Code responded, saying that it requires “serious conviction – or mental illness” to not sell when the price moves. It comes as no surprise that the mixture of irony, crazy predictions and institutional news keeps XRP relevant. For some of them, the “sell your house” comments are simply an exaggeration, but it showcases the passion and belief of the XRP community, which has planned and endorsed their position, and has continued to show the strength of their will no matter how volatile XRP price action has remained.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: JPMorgan doubles down on Bitcoin with $343M BTC bet – Details

Here’s why institutions are suddenly racing to get in. JPMorgan now holds 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, a 64% increase from last quarter. It reflects rising institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a core asset in global investment portfolios. JPMorgan is significantly ramping up its exposure to Bitcoin [BTC], highlighting a surge in institutional confidence toward the leading cryptocurrency. According to the bank’s latest 13F regulatory filing, its brokerage clients now hold 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), valued at approximately $343 million as of the 30th of September. This represents a 64% increase from the previous quarter’s 3.21 million shares. The report further reveals that JPMorgan’s exposure spans multiple divisions, including those managing high-net-worth and institutional portfolios. This broad participation reflects a strategic shift within the bank and its clients, who are seeking regulated, low-risk entry points into Bitcoin amid ongoing market fluctuations. The timing and scale of the investment signal that Wall Street’s largest players are no longer sitting on the sidelines. Instead, they are positioning themselves ahead of what they perceive as the next major leg in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. Yet, while JPMorgan’s crypto exposure deepens, not all corporate holders are faring well. Firms like Metaplanet, a known Bitcoin accumulator, are now facing steep paper losses, holding 30823 BTC at an average purchase price of $108,036, with losses of 5.37% as per Bitcointreasuries.net data. Still, the broader institutional landscape shows resilience rather than retreat. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), for instance, continued its steady Bitcoin accumulation, recently adding 397 BTC to its reserves. This happened at a time when Bitcoin was trading around $102,260, at press time, showing modest gains, while BlackRock’s IBIT recorded $131.4 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stood firm at 59.84%, meaning it now represents nearly 60% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Meanwhile, in traditional markets, JPMorgan’s stock rose 0.25% to $314.21, and BlackRock climbed 1.19% to $1,082.20, according to Google Finance. These slight upticks mirror the cautious optimism in financial circles, where institutions like JPMorgan are positioning themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next potential leg upward. That being said, BlackRock’s exposure is not just limited to Wall Street. In fact, the upcoming launch of iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by mid-November 2025 marks another strategic step in its global digital asset expansion. Therefore, with Australia emerging as one of the key frontiers for Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows surging, BlackRock’s move signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a core asset within global portfolios.

Title: Ethereum Price Surge To $5,500: What To Watch Out For To Mark The Bottom

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Coming out of weeks of downtrend, the Ethereum price could be looking to establish the next bottom as it sets up for a campaign toward new all-time highs. This is highlighted by crypto analyst MMBTtrader, who explained that the Ethereum price crash could be coming to an end. This is evidenced by a number of formations on the Ethereum price chart that suggest where the next lift-off might begin. In an analysis shared on the TradingView website, the crypto analyst explained that the Ethereum price is now testing the next crucial technical level. The importance of this level comes with a 50% retracement of the Fibonacci sequence. Thus, it means that the Ethereum price is seeing major support at this level. This support lies just above the $3,200 level, which the Ethereum price had managed to maintain through the market crash. This puts the critical level at the 0.5 Fibonacci support, which currently serves as the next make-or-break level for the cryptocurrency. If the Ethereum price is able to bounce off from here, then it could trigger the next wave of recoveries for the cryptocurrency. Not only that, it would be the signal that the bottom is finally in and the crash is over. The analyst further explains that this could lead to “a high-probability setup for a resumption of the primary bullish trend.” Such a breakout would lead to a rather strong bullish move for the digital asset, and the target from here would be a brand new all-time high. The first target from here would be $5,500 as bulls push the price higher. “This target is derived from the magnitude of the prior uptrend and represents a key resistance zone on the higher timeframes,” the analyst explained. The 0.5 Fibonacci level, as explained above, is a make-or-break level. This means that whichever direction the Ethereum price takes after hitting this level could determine where the cryptocurrency is headed next. With the bullish side already explored, there is still the possibility that Ethereum fails to establish support and a bottom. In the event of the Ethereum price actually breaking below this crucial level, then it would confirm the bearish pressure that has plagued the market. The analyst highlights on the chart that if the support breaks, then Ethereum could dump further below $3,000, with the major support lying just above $2,400. Such a decline would mean an over 30% crash for Ethereum, on top of the already struggling price. Therefore, it is imperative that bulls hold above $3,200 to prevent further decline.

Title: Looking for an interesting Christmas present? Start bidding for bargains at auction
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/11/08/looking-for-an-interesting-christmas-present-start-bidding-for-bargains-at-auction/

As Christmas shopping season begins, savvy searchers for gifts will be browsing auction catalogues for ideas. Buying presents at auction is a sustainable shopping option, because such purchases keep things in circulation for longer. Buying at auction often also represents good value for money, although prospective buyers should always be aware that most auctioneers add 20 per cent buyer’s commission plus VAT at 23 per cent on the buyer’s commission to the hammer price. So, for example, a painting bought for a hammer price of €1,000 will cost €1,246. There can also be an extra charge for online bidding. With these caveats in mind, there are plenty of auctions in the next few weeks that are worth checking out. Take, for example, the live auction of railway memorabilia at Mullen’s showrooms in Laurel Park, Bray, Co Wicklow on Monday November 10th, starting at 11am. The lithographs, watercolours, paintings and photographs of trains and 20th-century tourist posters promoting rail travel all belonged to Col Raymond O’Neill, the Lord O’Neill, who is the current owner of Shane’s Castle, near Randalstown in Co Antrim. From the early 1970s, Shane’s Castle had its own miniature railway line running from a platform near the Antrim Gate lodge to Shane’s Castle on the shores of Lough Neagh. It closed to the public in 1994. An avid collector of all kinds of “railwayana”, from enamelled advertising signs to model train sets, train timetables, maps, postcards and guide books, the Lord O’Neill is the former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, a past president of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland and a member of several other heritage bodies. He is the nephew of the late Terence O’Neill, former prime minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. His stepfather was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels. Some buyers will be drawn to the illustrious provenance of items, while others will be enticed by their collectability. Take, for example, the colourfully illustrated travel posters Come to Ulster (€700-€1,000) or the poster for London, Midland and Scottish Railway, Connemara by the artist Paul Henry (€600-€1,200). The Dublin and Blessington Tramway passing Russborough Estate in Co Wicklow by Sean Boylan in 1924 (€400-€600) is one of several paintings of trains travelling through scenic spots in this collection. The auction also includes vintage Airfix model kits and model trains including the North Pole locomotive and carriage on a display track (€100-€200) and a collection of die-cast models of trams (€40-€80). Mullen’s timed online auction of classic and contemporary interiors also has plenty of potential Christmas gifts, with reasonable estimates on lots of glassware, crockery and paintings. The lots will begin closing on November 9th from 6pm. Meanwhile, Adams Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery auction of 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is now closing its doors. “The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones, ideal for both everyday wear and special occasions,” says Elena McCrory from Adams Blackrock. The online auction, which closes at 7pm on November 13th, is on view until Sunday November 9th from 12-4pm daily at 17 Kildare Street, Dublin. And Lynes & Lynes auctioneers in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, is selling an eclectic range of items from several Cork residences, the recently closed Cotton Ball pub and recently closed Canty’s Garage, both in Cork City. The most striking item in the Lynes & Lynes auction has to be the 1914 Buick Tourer (€15,000-€20,000). Made by General Motors in Michigan, US, it was a luxury car at a time when motor vehicles were still relatively rare. Vintage photographic prints of Canty’s garage with delivery vehicles (€20-€30) will appeal to vintage car enthusiasts. Those seeking Christmas gifts will also have plenty to choose from at the Lynes & Lynes auction, including a set of antique glass decanters (€30-€50), Shanagarry pottery (€40-€60) and a selection of china teapots (€20-€40), all with reasonable estimates. Fans of antique fairs should note forthcoming fairs in Limerick Racecourse on November 15th and 16th and at Claregalway Castle in Co Galway on November 22nd and 23rd. Both are run by Hibernian Antique Fairs and feature dealers from the Republic and Northern Ireland. Finally, the Grace O’Malley Foundation will have a small auction at its annual fundraising lunch in the Westbury Hotel on Friday November 14th at 12.30pm. The charity provides practical home improvement supports to sick and older people struggling to survive in their own homes. The items for auction include a bronze December mask by the Irish sculptor Rory Breslin (€3,000-€5,000). A set of 14 river gods bronze masks by Breslin achieved a hammer price of €125,000 at Sheppard’s auction house earlier this year. Estimate: €2,000-€3,000 each Hammer price: €4,200 (black)/€3,200 (white) Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €6,000-€9,000 Hammer price: Not sold Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €200-€400 Hammer price: €420 Auction house: deVeres Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Title: XRP Price To Reach $1,000 By End Of 2025? Rumor Mills Are On Fire With BlackRock Speculations

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Speculations across the crypto space have ignited a wave of excitement for the XRP price as rumors linking BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Ripple, a crypto payments company, continue to spread. The possibility of XRP reaching $1,000 before the end of 2025 has become the latest hot topic, fueled by bold claims from top analysts who believe that this rumored partnership could set the stage for one of the most explosive bull runs in this cycle. Crypto market analyst ‘The Real Remi Relief’ has stirred significant interest with his post on X social media, claiming that if ongoing rumors about a potential partnership between BlackRock and Ripple prove true, the XRP price could reach $1,000 by the end of 2025. He advised holders to secure their XRP in cold wallets and prepare for a potential market-wide supply shock. His optimism stems from reports shared by another well-analyst @DelCrxpto, who revealed that sources deep within the crypto industry are hinting at a major development involving BlackRock and Ripple. According to these claims, the global asset manager may be preparing to collaborate with Ripple to establish infrastructure for the tokenization of all $5.3 trillion of its ETF liquidity. If such an initiative were to materialize, it would represent one of the largest integrations of blockchain into global finance. Ripple’s network, designed for fast and cost-effective asset transfers, could provide the foundation for tokenized ETFs, potentially transforming traditional investment markets. Additionally, the crypto payments company, which is already expanding into the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization sector, will broaden its technology and services to support a broader range of financial products. The possibility of such a partnership has reignited optimism within the XRP community, especially after the recent Ripple Swell event, which featured participation from prominent names including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Franklin Templeton, The White House, and several other global institutions. Notably, an ETF tokenization deal between Ripple and BlackRock could elevate XRP’s role in the digital asset and financial ecosystem, driving institutional adoption, which could propel its price. Despite growing optimism about XRP’s price outlook, the rumors remain unconfirmed, and neither Ripple nor BlackRock has issued any official statement. Market analyst @Steph_iscrypto has added fuel to the bullish excitement surrounding the XRP price with a technical analysis suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon enter another parabolic phase. He announced in his X post that “XRP will shock everyone in the next 1-3 months.” His accompanying weekly chart highlights bull rallies from past cycles, where XRP surged 2,117% in 2013, 110,466% in 2017, and 1,208% in 2020. Building on this trend, XRP has recently broken through a long-term resistance level, mirroring the early stages of its previous explosive bull cycles. If historical patterns repeat, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of another explosive bull run this cycle.

Title: Billionaire Bill Ackman Clowned For Mamdani Appeal After Mayoral Win

Time Published: 2025-11-07T17:27:39Z
Full Content:
Billionaire Bill Ackman is being laughed at for his humble words towards Zohran Mamdani after his NYC mayoral win. A billionaire behind some of the biggest attacks on New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is being raked over the coals for being highly conciliatory to him after his decisive win. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman congratulated Mamdani. “Congrats on the win,” he wrote, adding: Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” The tweet was a surprising pivot from his previous words about the Queens assemblyman during his campaign. Ackman, who is a noted supporter of President Donald Trump, had been backing independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race and was one of Mamdani’s most vicious critics, hammering him with false claims of him being antisemitic and “amplifying hate” against Jewish New Yorkers. Mamdani has been a firm critic of Israel’s policies, particularly in their conflict in Gaza. Those attacks were often seen in multi-paragraph posts on X, where he also tore down Mamdani’s campaign positions of making New York City more affordable for residents (which include increasing taxes on corporations and billionaires, free bus service, city-run grocery stores and rent freezes for stabilized apartments), claiming it would make the city “much more dangerous and economically unviable,” and spur an exodus of billionaires. Ackman went so far as to donate $1.75 million to two super PACs – Defend NYC and the pro-Cuomo group Fix The City. But now, his conciliatory words have been accepted by the 34-year-old mayor-elect. “I appreciated his words,” Mamdani said while appearing on Good Morning America on Wednesday (Nov. 5). “I think what I find is that there is a needed commitment from leaders of the city to speak and work with anyone who is committed to lowering the cost of living in the city—and that’s something that I will fulfill.” Ackman would be the first of a group of other wealthy figures making overtures to Mamdani. Blackrock co-founder Ralph Schlosstein also publicly pledged support. “I do care deeply about the city, and I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful,” he remarked, according to Forbes magazine. Mamdani is keeping his grassroots structured, as he begins the work of assuming office next January, announcing an all-woman transition team headed by former Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan.

Title: Warren Buffett-Inspired Strategy Drives Canadian Bitcoin Treasury Growth | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. What happens when long-term investment wisdom meets the fast-moving adoption of Bitcoin? A Canadian fintech is quietly blending patience, discipline, and digital assets, showing that a Buffett-inspired approach might find its footing in crypto. Mogo Inc., a Canadian fintech company, is demonstrating that Warren Buffett’s value investing principles can coexist with digital assets. In May 2024, the company adopted what it calls the Berkshire Hathaway playbook, integrating long-term, disciplined investing principles into its wealth platform. The move marked a deliberate pivot away from speculative trading. It emphasized patience, temperament, and behavioral discipline, core tenets of Buffett’s approach. Eighteen months later, that philosophy is showing tangible results in Mogo’s digital asset strategy, particularly Bitcoin. “Mogo reports continued platform growth and record assets under management in Q3 2025,” said Mogo Inc. President and co-founder Greg Feller. In Q3 2025, the company increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 300% quarter-over-quarter, bringing the total to $4.7 million. This follows a July 2025 move, where Mogo’s board approved a strategic initiative authorizing up to $50 million in Bitcoin allocations as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. The Q3 allocations were funded through excess cash and monetization of other investments, all while maintaining operational liquidity. The board has formally designated Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. This signals a structured, treasury-focused approach to crypto holdings rather than short-term speculation. The initiative forms part of a broader evolution of Mogo’s Intelligent Investing platform, which integrates both self-directed and managed investing. The system utilizes behavioral science to reduce impulsive trading and encourage measured, long-term decisions. These principles align with the Berkshire Hathaway ethos. By pairing this disciplined framework with a growing crypto allocation, Mogo is bridging traditional value investing and modern digital assets in a way rarely seen in the fintech space. Mogo’s approach contrasts sharply with the typical retail crypto market, dominated by high-frequency trading and leveraged bets. By treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the company is signaling that disciplined, long-term investment principles can survive, and even thrive, in crypto markets. The firm intends to continue building its Bitcoin treasury while expanding the behavioral investing features of its platform. “With the wind-down of our legacy trading business now behind us and continued execution of our Bitcoin treasury strategy, we’re entering 2026 with a stronger foundation and multiple tailwinds supporting our momentum,” read an excerpt in the press release, citing Feller. Its Q3 report makes clear that the fintech sees this as a structural shift, one that combines Buffett-inspired discipline with the opportunities of the digital asset economy. Investors fatigued by speculation can emulate the Canadian company’s approach, which showcases a rare model for measured and thoughtful participation in Bitcoin.

Title: First-Time Home Buyer Share Falls to Historic Low of 21%, Median Age Rises to 40

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 6:09:57 AM PST by yesthatjallen The share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to the National Association of REALTORS®' 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers. This annual survey of recent home buyers and sellers covers transactions between July 2024 and June 2025 and offers industry professionals, consumers, and policymakers detailed insights into homebuying and selling behavior. "The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory," said Jessica Lautz NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. "The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007 – right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering. Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result." "Unfolding in the housing market is a tale of two cities," Lautz explained. "We're seeing buyers with significant housing equity making larger down payments and all-cash offers, while first-time buyers continue to struggle to enter the market." "For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream," said Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. "Delayed or denied homeownership until age 40 instead of 30 can mean losing roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. FHA and VA programs have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, join the middle class, and create intergenerational wealth – a testament to smart government policy in support of homeownership."

"The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007 – right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering. Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result." "Unfolding in the housing market is a tale of two cities," Lautz explained. "We're seeing buyers with significant housing equity making larger down payments and all-cash offers, while first-time buyers continue to struggle to enter the market." "For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream," said Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. "Delayed or denied homeownership until age 40 instead of 30 can mean losing roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. FHA and VA programs have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, join the middle class, and create intergenerational wealth – a testament to smart government policy in support of homeownership."

Title: RWA Platforms Keep Launching—Then Hitting the Same Regulatory Wall

Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:00:29Z

Real-world asset (RWA) platforms that offer regulated securities keep launching with the same playbook. They build for one jurisdiction, secure regulatory approval, and announce institutional partnerships, only to hit a wall when they need licensing to offer those assets across borders. The SEC, MiFID II and Singapore’s MAS all impose different rules on who can legally purchase securities, which means platforms need jurisdiction-specific approvals and must navigate conflicting investor eligibility rules for each new market.

You can opt out anytime. Recent projections by Standard Chartered suggest that the tokenized asset market could grow to $30 trillion by 2034. With BlackRock’s launch of tokenized fund BUIDL and Coinbase’s acquisition of crypto fundraising platform Echo, the institutional interest just keeps rising. But talk to anyone trying to put capital into tokenized assets at scale, and you’ll hear the same complaint: compliance has become a fragmentation nightmare. It’s not that institutions don’t want in. They do. The efficiency gains are obvious: fractional ownership, instant settlement and global liquidity pools. The problem is that every jurisdiction wants something different, and nobody’s built infrastructure that handles all of those differences without duct tape and manual workarounds. Launch a tokenized bond meant to work across multiple markets, and you’re navigating regulatory frameworks that fundamentally contradict each other. The SEC demands specific investor disclosures and accreditation checks. MiFID II requires different transparency standards. Being compliant means something entirely different depending on where your investors are located. Most platforms respond by staying in one jurisdiction. That’s fine for pilots and small-scale tests, but fails once you need institutional capital distributed across global markets. Those that attempt international expansion end up layering custom compliance systems for each region, often rebuilding core infrastructure every time. That approach caps your addressable market before you start. It explains why the technology keeps advancing while institutional adoption stalls. BlackRock can tokenize funds across seven blockchains, but if each blockchain operates in regulatory isolation, you haven’t solved the problem; you’ve just multiplied it. The next generation of RWA platforms won’t eliminate regulatory complexity, because that’s unrealistic given how different jurisdictions operate. What they can do is abstract it so the complexity becomes invisible to the end user. Think of it like payment processing. Stripe doesn’t ask merchants to build separate integrations for Visa, Mastercard, American Express and every regional payment method. You plug into Stripe once, and it handles all the backend complexity of routing transactions through different networks, applying the right fraud checks and managing compliance requirements across payment types. The merchant gets a single API, but customers can pay however they choose. Modular compliance tokenized assets should work the same way. You build your platform once with compliance layers that plug into a unified technology stack. When you tokenize an asset, the system automatically enforces jurisdiction-specific rules based on each investor’s location. It all happens programmatically, without anyone manually coordinating fifteen different regulatory regimes. The technology to do this already exists. Smart contracts can encode transfer restrictions by jurisdiction. Automated AML systems flag suspicious activity in real time. Reusable digital identity solutions handle cross-border KYC without forcing investors to resubmit documents for every platform they touch. What’s been missing is someone building these capabilities into a unified system that institutions trust and regulators can audit. Institutional investors don’t just want compliance in the abstract sense. They want concrete proof that they can show to regulators on demand. That means real-time reports that update automatically, immutable transaction records that can’t be altered after the fact, and the ability to demonstrate—at any time to any regulator—that every single trade followed all applicable rules from day one. Every question of who owned which asset, when and under what legal framework should have a clear, auditable answer. The platforms that win institutional adoption will be the ones where compliance isn’t something you retrofit onto an existing system but is something that’s native to how the platform operates from its core architecture. Every transaction should generate a proper audit trail automatically, every token transfer should validate all regulatory requirements before execution and every corporate action should get logged in ways that satisfy both blockchain transparency standards and traditional financial oversight requirements. If the first generation of RWA platforms proved that tokenization can work, the next must prove that it can scale. That won’t happen through more pilots or technical proofs of concept. It will require infrastructure designed for a fragmented regulatory world from day one. The future of tokenized finance won’t belong to whoever builds the flashiest blockchain integrations, but to whoever builds compliance that travels. Until platforms can offer global reach with local precision, the trillion-dollar opportunity in tokenized assets will remain trapped behind national borders.

Title: WealthStack Roundup: GeoWealth Launches Private Model Marketplace

A flurry of wealthtech announcements from Asset-Map and eMoney, Evergreen Wealth, Alphathena, d1g1t, and PreciseFP this week. November 7, 2025 GeoWealth, a turnkey asset management platform, introduced a Private Model Marketplace that coalesces strategies it's been amassing for the past year using models constructed by Apollo, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Through GeoWealth’s unified managed account technology, advisors using the platform can build custom models or pick from pre-built ones that include exposure to private markets. Users can create standalone models or combine them with public models in the same custodial account. “We built the Private Model Marketplace to provide advisors with a turnkey, fully managed solution that delivers private market exposure without the operational burden,” GeoWealth CEO Colin Falls said in a statement. “We believe the industry is in its early days of private markets adoption, and our purpose-built technology will help RIAs meet client demand in these asset classes.” The move is the culmination of a series of announcements. In June 2024, the firm raised $18 million in growth investment funding, with BlackRock as a new lead investor. Then this past August, it raised $38 million in Series C funding led by Apollo. The two firms also announced a partnership centered on public-private model portfolios. Related:The Word on WealthTech for October 2025 In addition, just over one year ago, GeoWealth announced partnerships with Goldman Sachs and iCapital centered around bringing private market options to models. It forged a similar pact with J.P. Morgan Asset Management last month. Advisors using both Asset-Map and eMoney Advisor are now able to import their clients’ planning data from the latter and take full advantage of the visual storytelling tools in the former, thanks to a new integration announced between the two this week. Simply put, vast numbers of advisors rely on eMoney to perform complex and comprehensive financial planning for their clients, but using Asset-Map, advisors can visually illustrate the context of entire households and their assets, helping to simplify conversations and more clearly delineate and present household recommendations. And with the integration, Asset-Map reports can be easily dropped into the eMoney vault. A live demonstration from both teams online is scheduled for Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET (registration required).

Title: U.S. investors dump $700M in Bitcoin – Is BTC’s $100K support at risk?

Here’s why Bitcoin could drop to $95K in November. Major economic zones were aggressively selling Bitcoin, with the US at the forefront. The odds of Bitcoin reaching $95,000 have climbed to 48%. Bitcoin [BTC] was trading near the $100K mark at press time. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has dropped by 1.5%, with further downside possible due to widespread selling pressure globally. The U.S. was leading in selling BTC, at the time of writing, as seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. The index has been in the red region since the 30th of October, reflecting the massive dumping by U.S. entities. For instance, BlackRock sold 6,800 BTC valued at more than $700 million, averaging about $30 million per transaction. The entity did not seem to stop this capital outflow from Bitcoin and its products ahead of the Fed announcement. Source: CoinGlass Additionally, Bitcoin ETF flows turned positive after six consecutive days of outflows. As per a post by Satoshi Staker, BTC ETFs saw about $240 million in inflows in the past 24 hours, though it was not enough to counter the outflows. The aggressive dumping by US entities made any reversal difficult, as other jurisdictions also mirrored this behavior. The chances of a market reversal were low, as selling pressure extended across Asia and the European Union. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s Cumulative Return By Session fell from roughly +3% to -4%, reflecting growing bearish momentum. Bearish sentiment intensified, with sellers dominating each session. On the 6th of November, sell orders far outweighed ETF inflows, effectively wiping out buy-side demand. Source: Velo This sentiment was reflected in Polymarket’s prediction markets about “What price will Bitcoin hit in November?” The chances of BTC dipping to $95,000 rose to 48%, while the odds of a decline to $90,000 now stand at 24%. Meanwhile, chances of BTC climbing to $115,000 or higher have fallen, averaging between 2% and 8%. Overall market sentiment remains tilted toward selling, likely influenced by the AI bubble, record job cuts, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. In addition, global tariff tensions have added further pressure on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. As the odds of a reversal continue to shrink, the CVD divergences could hint at when to anticipate one. According to Hyblock Capital data, whenever selling exceeded buying on shorter timeframes, prices tended to close higher, and vice versa. Source: Hyblock Capital Altogether, Bitcoin was undergoing massive sell pressure across the globe, explaining the current weakness. Therefore, a recovery could happen only when bids outweighed asks and aggressive selling halted.

Title: It’s Part of the Game: Matt Tuttle on Closing ETFs and Looking to the Stars

ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Matthew Tuttle isn’t necessarily looking to be in most portfolios. In fact, he said his company’s strategies are better fits for clients seeking high risks and high rewards, and they often speak more directly to Reddit day traders with Robinhood accounts than moms and pops with IRAs. Tuttle Capital Management has a slew of 2x single-stock funds, and tries to avoid strong correlation with major indexes. It’s also not afraid to bet on out-of-this-world ideas. “The S&P 500 is great, but launching an S&P 500 fund is never going to work from our standpoint,” Tuttle said. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle recently to discuss his approach to ETFs, what happens when a fund doesn’t work out and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETF Upside: What’s the philosophy behind your ETFs? Matt Tuttle: I’m an active trader, so a good idea is something I would buy. I’m not going to launch a product that I wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole. It’s also got to be something that I can market. My space is with self-directed investors and some independent advisors. I can’t compete with BlackRock, so I’m never getting into Merrill Lynch, UBS or anything like that. A fund needs to be different from what’s already out there. Being first is huge, especially for us. BlackRock can be 10th, and it doesn’t matter. For me, we’ve got to be first. If we’re not first, I’m probably not interested. The UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF turned some heads. What prompted filing for that fund? This is something I’ve been fascinated with since I was a kid. Where that fascination turned into a product started in 2017 when The New York Times broke a story about a secret Pentagon group that was tracking UFOs. They provided footage of fighter pilots chasing these Tic Tac things that moved in ways that theoretically are impossible. Everyone’s asking, “Are they aliens? Are they Chinese? Are they this or that?” which are all great questions. But I’m looking at that and saying, “What energy source are they using?” We’ve been having these Congressional meetings where people are testifying, saying we are reverse-engineering some of this technology. This topic has so much disinformation in it that it’s hard to know what to believe, but if that technology were to ever surface, it would be a game-changer. I was trading in the early days of the internet. I’m now actively trading AI stocks. If a source of free energy were made available, it would be the biggest thing ever, so I filed an ETF for it. I had serious people, not the tinfoil hat people, but serious people reaching out to me — people high up in big investment firms, reporters, venture capitalists, academics, those who had been in the defense industry — saying this was really cool and the tech exists. Also, if we’re ever going to get the truth, I think this [Trump] administration is going to be the one that does it. You’ve filed for and issued a lot of single-stock or single-asset funds. What advantages do you see in those? We’ve really created an ecosystem with them. When we first started doing this, it was Tesla and Nvidia, and that was it. But now there’s more and more money going into more and more stocks, and post-covid, that market has gotten more thematic. There’s a group of stocks today that I think people would call meme stocks, but I don’t like that. Yesterday’s meme stocks were AMC and GameStop, which were crap companies that hedge funds would short, rightfully so. But then a bunch of retail investors banded together to crush the hedge funds. Now you’ve got a bunch of companies that are positioned to take off tomorrow. You could argue these are companies that don’t have any earnings, but they’re also positioned at the forefront of where the world is going. A lot of these stocks are not crap companies, they’re just early. Covid changed everything because you had these guys working from home, no boss over their shoulders, and they started trading stocks. They got fed up with just putting their money in the S&P 500 and earning 8% to 12% a year. They started connecting on social media, and they’re a powerful force. I just got back from Korea, and they love this stuff. You’re not allowed to gamble in Korea, so I think this is their gambling. There’s also a lot of places where people can’t buy Bitcoin, but they can buy a 2x long in MicroStrategy, so that’s what they do as the alternative. There’s a lot going on that has contributed to the rise of these 2X long single-stocks. What happens when an ETF just doesn’t work out and has to fold? It’s part of the game. As long as I have the vision of getting the fund to $15 million, I’m going to launch something. But sometimes, that doesn’t come to pass. The one that really bothered me was the inverse [Jim] Cramer fund. A lot of it was timing. If I had come out with it in 2022, we’d have billions of dollars in it, and it would’ve been awesome. I came out with it in 2023 a few months before Nvidia shared its earnings, showed the world AI is here, and the Mag 7 basically quadrupled. Everything else he calls turns to crap, but he got the Mag 7 right, and he wasn’t moving off of it. I can’t have an inverse Cramer fund and be intellectually honest about it when my personal account is loaded to the gills with the Mag 7. That one sucked. I really wanted to make it work. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, along with venture capital firm General Catalyst, is trying to buy Janus Henderson, and an AI makeover could be in its future. Investors who want in on Alpha Architect’s next 351 exchange ETF no longer need at least $1 million — as long as their account is at Charles Schwab. The legacy mutual fund provider has filed for a crypto index fund, bringing TradFi and DeFi one step closer together. Pictet Asset Management, which oversees $800 billion, recently launched three ETFs that lean on AI, with plans to add two emerging markets strategies early next year. The Goldman Sachs MSCI World Private Equity Return Tracker ETF does its best to replicate PE performance with publicly traded stocks. Banks are writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in loan defaults, and the wind down in CLO trading may not be a bad thing. The acquisition marks one of the first major purchases of an ETF provider by a US crypto trading platform. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How Tesla has prepared to defend Musk's mega pay package from legal challenges

Every time Tom publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tesla won the war for Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package. Now it's prepared to win future legal battles. Shareholders voted to approve the record-breaking compensation plan by a 75% margin on Thursday, paving the way for Musk to become the world's first trillionaire should he meet a series of ambitious product and financial goals. It came after the Tesla CEO's previous $56 billion pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018 and again in 2024, was struck down by a Delaware judge last year following an investor lawsuit. Since then, Tesla has made a series of moves to ensure Musk's $1 trillion payday doesn't suffer the same fate. The EV giant has relocated its legal home from Delaware to Texas after gaining shareholder approval for the move at its 2024 annual meeting. In May, the Lone Star State passed SB 29 and SB 1057, two bills that make it much harder for small shareholders to bring legal challenges against companies. Under SB 29, litigants must now prove in a lawsuit that a company's directors are not acting in good faith and that they have engaged in fraud or violated the law. The bill also introduced a new rule that shareholders have to own at least 3% of the company's shares to bring legal action, also known as a derivative lawsuit. The threshold is not automatically applied to companies, but Tesla incorporated it into its bylaws in May. Only Musk himself and a handful of large, institutional investors, including BlackRock and Vanguard Group, own more than 3% of Tesla — and although shareholders can club together, $42 billion worth of shares is a high bar to meet. By contrast, the lawsuit that led to the Delaware Court of Chancery's ruling on Musk's previous pay package was bought by Richard Tornetta, a former heavy-metal drummer who owned just nine Tesla shares at the time. The judge in the Tornetta case ruled that Musk was too close to some of Tesla's board members for them to act independently, and that Tesla's board did not do enough to justify how it arrived at the package's $56 billion figure. Legal professors told Business Insider that it would be far more difficult for shareholders to bring legal challenges against Musk's new pay package in Texas. "I think that it would be a very hard road to challenge this in court," said William Magnuson, a professor of law at Texas A&M University, citing the changes to Texas law that have granted heightened legal protection for company directors. "All of these really have greatly limited the ability of shareholders to challenge misbehavior by boards of directors," he said. James Spindler, a corporate and securities law professor at the University of Texas, agreed. He said that while Tesla shareholders could still challenge the level of disclosure surrounding the pay package under Texas law, as Tornetta did in Delaware, the 3% standing threshold made the prospect of a similar lawsuit unlikely. "For a public company, that's probably going to be the end of the matter. When you're talking about a multibillion-dollar company, there just aren't going to be that many people that own 3% of the shares," Spinder added. After a Delaware court struck down his last pay package, Musk urged other companies to leave the state, and several have followed Tesla and SpaceX's lead. The Diamond state has since tweaked its corporate law provisions to make it harder for small shareholders to bring derivative lawsuits. Delaware's move came as states like Texas and Nevada attempt to woo big companies with their own director-friendly regulations, and Magnuson said that companies are increasingly seeking to move to states with "friendlier" corporate law statutes that place more limits on shareholder's rights. "I think that we're at the beginning of a real sea change in the way that corporate law works," he added. Jump to

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap 6-day outflow streak as key trendline is back in focus

BlackRock and Fidelity led a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on Thursday, as traders shifted their focus to the 50-week EMA at about $100,000. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs recorded $240 million in inflows on Thursday, ending a six-day outflow streak. Bitcoin’s failure to drop below the 50-day EMA suggests strong support in this area. Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ended a six-day outflow streak with inflows returning on Thursday, leading traders to say they believe that a recovery is imminent as long as the BTC price holds the 50-week EMA. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a six-day streak of net outflows on Thursday, with $240 million in daily inflows. The outflow streak started on Oct. 29 and extended through Wednesday, with the biggest outflows comprising $577.74 million on Tuesday. Related: Crypto ETFs ‘punching above weight’ as almost half of ETF investors plan buys The streak of outflows followed a Bitcoin market correction that saw BTC price plunge below $100,000 for the first time since June. On Tuesday, the BTC/USD pair reached a four-month low of $98,900. The price had recovered 3% on Friday. The largest inflow was to BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, at $112.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $61.6 million, while ARK Invest’s ARKB added $60.4 million. Bitwise’s BITB posted moderate inflows of $5.5 million and $2.48 million, while the rest of the ETFs saw no inflows or outflows. Cumulative net inflows remain robust at $60.5 billion, and total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $135.43 billion, accounting for 5.42% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. After dropping to $98,000 on Tuesday, Bitcoin quickly reclaimed the $100,000 psychological level, which coincided with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This suggested that bulls were aggressively defending this level. Note that this trendline (yellow line in the chart below) has supported the price since September 2023, and losing it would be detrimental for the bulls. Bitcoin is “sitting right at the 50-week SMA, the line in the sand,” wrote YouTuber Lark Davis in a Thursday post on X, adding: “So far Bitcoin is still holding the 50-week EMA,” pseudonymous technical analyst Chad said, adding that it is important for the BTC/USD pair to close the week above this level. Fellow analyst Rekt Capital wrote that Bitcoin appears to be bottoming out around the 50-day EMA and must make a “cluster of lower lows” at this level to establish a bottom. As Cointelegraph reported, the MVRV ratio (market value to realized value) suggested $98,000 may have indeed marked the local bottom for BTC, suggesting that the price can recover due to seller exhaustion.

Title: For the Movement That Elected Zohran Mamdani, Now Comes the Hard Part

To win bold demands, social movements must go on the offensive. Holding political office is not the same as wielding political power—especially for the left. To win bold demands, social movements must go on the offensive. New Yorkers celebrate as NY1 projects Zohran Mamdani to win the New York City mayoral election in the Astoria neighborhood of New York City on November 4, 2025. By electing Zohran Mamdani mayor, New York City made history. Now comes the hard part. Holding political office is not the same thing as wielding political power—especially for the left. The CEOs of Blackrock, Vanguard, KKR, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are not suddenly going to say, “OK, socialists, you won. Here are the keys to the city.” Mamdani won’t be successful on his own. The question is now: Will the nascent social movement behind Mamdani rise to meet the challenge? To win the bold demands that powered Mamdani’s campaign and to tap into the growing popular energy nationally, the emerging social movement must go on the offensive. The CEOs are already girding for class war over the campaign’s signature issues—taxing the rich, a rent freeze, universal childcare, fast and free buses, and public groceries. They don’t want to pay for these things, and they really don’t want to give up power and control of the city. What we win in the end will be determined not by polling numbers or viral social media memes or a mayor friendly to socialist policies, but by the balance of forces between the social movement and our opponents. This requires mounting campaigns that go far beyond the traditional political advocacy of lobbying, petitions, and testimony. Just as unionized workers win demands by threatening to disrupt business with strikes, we will have to show our opponents that there is a cost to denying working people the campaign’s central demands. That means escalating toward large and disruptive actions, enough to shake the CEOs and the political establishment into making concessions. For anyone who has been involved in organizing a union before, the big-business assault on Mamdani so far has been familiar: intimidation, co-optation, outright lying, and division. But the reaction now will be orders of magnitude greater than any union-busting campaign. CEOs and billionaires—and the media beholden to them—are already stoking fear and anxiety with the specter of capital strikes and capital flight. “If Mamdani becomes the mayor of New York, you’re going to see the flight of businesses from New York,” predicted billionaire hedge fund executive Bill Ackman after Mamdani’s primary win. “Billionaire CEO warns he’ll close grocery stores if democratic socialist candidate wins NYC mayor race,” blared a post-primary Fox News headline. Democratic Party leaders, while temporarily stunned by the movement’s strength, will recover their footing and work tirelessly to buy off, divert, and stymie the burgeoning socialist energy. Governor Kathy Hochul, even while endorsing Mamdani, has laid down her political marker: no new taxes on the rich—in direct opposition to Mamdani’s core platform. And then there’s Trump. In the coming months—and maybe much sooner—Trump likely will deploy the National Guard in New York City and cut off federal funding. But if we anticipate the coming reactions, we can properly prepare, organize, and fight back. My new book, We’re Coming for You and Your Rotten System: How Socialists Beat Amazon and Upended Big-City Politics, chronicles how movements led by Kshama Sawant, a socialist who held one seat in a nine-member city council in Seattle, won transformative victories over the course of a decade. I worked in her council office for most of that time, when we passed the first-ever tax on Amazon to build social housing (beating Amazon’s capital strike threat), became first big city to win a $15-an-hour minimum wage (going in January to $21.30 an hour), strengthened renters’ rights, increased abortion and mental health care funding, banned caste discrimination, funded LGBTQ youth services, and more. Sawant won reelection three times, defeating the combined forces of the political establishment and Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft, Expedia, global financiers, and developers. We did not win by trying to change mainstream political parties from within or by playing by the establishment’s rules; we formed our own independent political movements, building power outside of and in opposition to other politicians. Our movement was led by Sawant, a Marxist, and the political organization she belonged to, Socialist Alternative. Sawant saw her political role as being a shop steward for the working class. She held herself accountable to people in the streets, not in the suites. Tracing Sawant’s 10 years on the Seattle City Council, my book details the theory and practice of what I call three pillars of Marxist insurgent struggle. Leah Abrams Jon Wiener Justin Lynch Kate Wheeling First, we recognized that political struggle is class struggle. The people’s interests are fundamentally in conflict with the interests of big business and billionaires. We understood that socialists and our ideas were not welcome inside the halls of power, that political office did not provide some genteel space where earnest persuasion and lobbying could win the day. Rather, the state apparatus—the executive and legislative branches of governments, the bureaucracy, the courts, and the police, along with adjacent institutions including the media and mainstream political parties—upholds and reproduces the capitalist status quo. Rules like limits on local taxing authority are the political instruments through which economic elites maintain and reinforce their domination and control. That’s why we recognized that to achieve anything we had to reject a traditional political role and instead use our socialist office to build mass movements strong enough to force political concessions. Our second principle was advancing bold material demands, explicitly connected to the call for broader societal change. The demands that Mamdani has championed—a freeze on rent, taxes on the rich, fast and free buses—are good examples, though he should go even further. In Seattle, we saw how working people alienated by mainstream politics will get engaged when they see a movement that speaks to their material needs, explains the underlying problem, and provides a course of action. This helps explain why an astounding 90,000 people volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign. Bold demands also are important for us as socialists, because through the fight, we educate the broader community about capitalism’s inability to meet society’s basic needs. Demands and the campaigns for them can underscore why we must build movements not just for reform but for systemic change. We should push for a rent freeze, absolutely, but that should be a step toward kicking out big landlords to make housing a human right, not a commodity. The third principle that we practiced was popular democracy—the ongoing engagement of community members in setting demands and deciding strategy. Sawant and Socialist Alternative invited community members into forums where they would discuss and decide what demands to place before City Council and how to wage the fights. The $15 minimum wage and the Amazon tax strategies were developed through neighborhood and citywide meetings, culminating in mass meetings of hundreds of workers. We organized popular assemblies for tenants’ rights, LGBTQ rights, and a ceasefire in Gaza. We took over City Council meetings with hundreds of people. To put those three principles into action required an organization—and one that wasn’t the Democratic Party. During the 10 years that Sawant was in office, that organization was Socialist Alternative. The movement backing Sawant recognized that the 50-year neoliberal project is bipartisan. The federal minimum wage hasn’t budged in 16 years, even when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House. When Democrats held Congress, they failed to enshrine women’s reproductive rights or improve labor law. No matter which party is in power, military budgets soar, social benefits get cut, genocide and imperial wars carry on, and racist police killings continue. Today, 60 percent of Americans say that neither the Democrats nor Republicans represent them and that a new political party is needed. It’s been at that level for the last dozen years. Among adults under 50, support for a new party is even higher—70 percent. Many activists backing socialists and other progressives for office today want to believe that we can change the Democratic Party from within. For most of my life, I believed that, too. But we need to be clear-eyed about what the Democratic Party is. As Nancy Pelosi said in 2017, “We’re capitalist. And that’s just the way it is.” That’s why inside-the-party initiatives by democratic socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal—have languished in the Democrats’ legislative dungeon. You cannot build an anti-capitalist movement within a capitalist party, which is why it is a problem that Mamdani has adopted this same insider approach. To press the movement’s demands, like a rent freeze, universal affordable childcare, and fast and free buses, “New Yorkers will need to learn and organize independently of Mamdani, the Democratic mayor,” noted Hakan Yilmaz of the Tempest NYC Organizing Committee. If we were a union in a workplace following an election victory, we’d be recruiting to expand our organizing committees, department by department. We’d have an escalating plan of action—steps to build worker confidence and project our power. And we’d be building toward strike action, because ultimately to move the boss, you must be prepared to disrupt and shut down the business. Going up against today’s fusion of the billionaire class, government, and outright fascists, we must build movements along those same lines. Neighborhood committees—such as those developed during Mamdani’s campaign and those fighting ICE in Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere—should become the building blocks for citywide movements. These city movements, in turn, combine to form the foundation of a national movement. As we build capacity and demand economic justice and civil liberty for all, we must develop escalating strategies that point toward disruption: strikes that create a political crisis for the elites and that build fortifications against Trump’s war on immigrants and other marginalized communities. One idea from activists is a mass petition in support of public services. Good, but only a start. We should think bigger: citywide marches on Inauguration Day that flood the streets with hundreds of thousands of workers taking the day off, occupations of state capitals like Albany until the politicians yield on local taxing authority, shutdowns of cities when Trump tries to send in his ICE thugs. Where we have the capacity, we should launch coordinated strikes and nonviolent civil disobedience. If this sounds like rule-breaking, it is; the rules are designed for workers to lose. The 2018 West Virginia educators strike was an illegal strike, and it ignited a national Red for Ed movement that inspired other law-breaking walkouts. Civil rights were won by defying racist laws. The 1930s New Deal advances came not through Franklin Roosevelt’s munificence but because of massive, disruptive workplace occupations, strikes, and marches. For a present-day example, look to the general strike just last month of 2 million Italian workers, who, defying threats of fines and criminal penalties, shut down the country in solidarity with the Gaza aid flotilla and forced the right-wing government of Giorgia Meloni to tighten weapons exports to Israel. Today, social movements in the United States lack the organizational strength, political acuity, and experience to mobilize that level of disruption. Union density, for example, is three times higher in Italy than it is in the United States, and the Italians have much more experience flexing the strike muscle. But that militancy exists within our collective past: Think of the civil rights movement that broke Jim Crow laws or the mass worker uprisings of the 1930s that won us Social Security, labor rights, minimum wages, and millions of public works jobs. We must forge ahead with urgency toward this ambitious vision. Seattle is not New York, but the principles of class struggle, bold demands, and popular democracy, backed by strong organization, are on the mark, because the underlying dynamics of political struggle are the same anywhere that capitalism rules. This week’s elections give left social movements tremendous momentum. But they also place us at a crossroads: If movements try once again to work within the political establishment, they will squander their energy. The movement behind Mamdani should strike out in a new, independent direction to give us a fighting chance against the billionaires and Trump.

Title: BlackRock Just Gave the XRP Community What It’s Been Waiting For

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byAnn Maria Shibu Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference in New York may have delivered one of the most defining moments in the digital asset industry’s relationship with Wall Street. The XRP community, in particular, got its long-awaited validation. During a keynote session, Maxwell Stein of BlackRock’s digital assets team told the audience that “the market is ready for large-scale blockchain adoption” and that infrastructure from Ripple could soon move trillions of dollars on-chain. Stein praised early industry builders like Ripple for proving blockchain’s real-world utility, not just as a speculative concept but as a functioning layer of financial infrastructure. “They’ve already tokenized fixed income, bonds, stablecoins… that’s where it started. But this is the rails for trillions in capital flows,” said Stein. A BlackRock executive publicly crediting Ripple for helping prove blockchain’s real-world functionality marked a milestone in the narrative XRP holders have championed for years. For a community that has long argued Ripple’s technology will underpin institutional liquidity, the comment landed like a thunderclap. For the longest time, the XRP community has clung to the belief that Ripple’s technology will serve as the bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy. Upon Stein’s statement, the XRP supporters across X (Twitter) saw the remark as long-awaited validation from the world’s largest asset manager. 🚨BREAKING: BlackRock Exec at Ripple Swell: “The Market Is Ready — Trillions Are Coming On-Chain” 💥This might’ve been the most electric moment of @Ripple Swell 2025.Maxwell Stein, a representative from @BlackRock, took the stage and straight-up said what everyone’s been… pic.twitter.com/OpuysMrq47 “We’ve seen what early adopters of crypto have done — they’ve shown us what’s possible. And now, the market is ready for broader adoption,” he added. His statement highlighted a shift in tone from TradFi, that blockchain is no longer an experiment. Rather, it is an emerging standard. However, the excitement that followed was tempered by legal caution. Australian lawyer and renowned XRP advocate Bill Morgan was among the first to raise questions about Stein’s remarks. He wondered whether they reflected an official BlackRock position or were simply Stein’s personal opinion. “Very interesting, but… was he speaking in a personal capacity or for BlackRock?” Morgan posted on X. The question resonated deeply because of what’s at stake. If Stein’s statement signals BlackRock’s strategic confidence in tokenized finance, it could mark one of the clearest indications yet that institutional adoption is imminent. If personal, it remains a powerful, but unofficial endorsement of Ripple and blockchain’s direction by extension. In the same event, Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman said the digital asset market is clearly maturing. However, she also acknowledged that regulatory clarity is essential for full-scale institutional participation. “To get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” she emphasized, noting that banks are already experimenting with tokenized bonds and stablecoin frameworks. Together, the remarks from Stein and Friedman painted a picture of convergence, where TradFi, blockchain, and regulation are aligning. Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference, once an industry event primarily for crypto insiders, became a stage where some of the most influential voices in global finance signaled readiness for integration. Despite these developments, along with the network’s growing institutional deals and exploding XRP adoption, the Ripple price remains lull. In the last 24 hours, the XRP price has been down by over 4%. It was trading for $2.21 as of this writing.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap six-day outflow streak with $240M inflows

Time Published: 2025-11-07T09:47:40Z

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $240 million in inflows after six straight days of outflows, signaling a renewed wave of institutional demand for BTC. Update Nov. 7, 1:53 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add a Twitter post from Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a $239.9 million net inflow on Thursday, ending a six-day slump of outflows draining almost $1.4 billion from the market. According to data from Farside Investors, the reversal came after a turbulent week of profit-taking driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, which led to redemptions across the largest institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicles. The rebound was led by asset manager BlackRock, which added $112.4 million to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $61.6 million. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) reported $60.4 million, while Grayscale's GBTC, which had experienced consistent outflows since mid-October, showed no change. In total, the six-day sell-off marked one of the steepest pullbacks since the ETFs started trading in January. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a Friday X post that despite a 20% market drawdown, US Bitcoin ETFs saw less than $1 billion in total outflows, which means 99.5% of assets remain invested. Balchunas said that even after the correction, ETF investors “hung tough,” highlighting the staying power of long-term holders. He added that the strong retention rate suggests the selling pressure didn’t come from outside investors, but rather “from inside the house.” Similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs, the exchange-traded products tracking Ether (ETH) also saw a six-day outflow streak on a smaller scale. According to SoSoValue, spot ETH ETFs had a six-day sell-off, resulting in about $837 million being withdrawn from the ETH-based crypto investment products. This was finally reversed on Thursday, when spot Ether ETFs saw small gains of $12.51 million. Spot Solana (SOL) ETFs have performed well since their launch on Oct. 28. SoSoValue data shows that SOL-based products have seen $322 million in inflows since their launch and haven’t had a day of net outflows. Related: Bitcoin bulls retreat as spot BTC ETF outflows deepen and macro fears grow On Thursday, crypto market maker Wintermute assigned ETFs as one of the three key pillars of liquidity for the crypto sector. In a blog post, Wintermute said that liquidity remains the key driving force behind every crypto cycle, arguing that it has a greater impact than technological developments. Wintermute said that stablecoins, ETFs and digital asset treasuries were the three major pillars for crypto liquidity, and pointed out that liquidity inflows in all three sectors have reached a plateau. A recent survey from brokerage giant Schwab Asset Management revealed that 52% of respondents plan to invest in ETFs, while 45% expressed interest in crypto-linked ETFs.

Title: Shayne Bolton takes the Mack Hansen route through the Ireland pecking order
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/11/07/shayne-bolton-takes-the-mack-hansen-route-through-the-ireland-pecking-order/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
As a 17-year-old, Shayne Bolton had a choice to make. A talented all-round sportsman in his school days, he had to pick between rugby and golf. He already had his handicap down to scratch at the time and was considered to be very talented in both. Unsurprisingly for a young South African, Bolton chose rugby before he had to make another choice four years later. Born and reared in Pretoria and schooled in the Hoërskool Eldoraigne, an Afrikaans co-ed in the Gauteng province, Bolton played for the Blue Bulls and was then given a two-year contract with the Cheetahs academy. On its completion, however, his deal was not extended. Playing University rugby but without any apparent future in South African rugby, Connacht became aware that Bolton had an Irish grandmother, Noirín Stapleton from Blackrock in Dublin. The player was highly recommended by the province’s contacts. Many gems can easily slip through the net in South African rugby before being polished elsewhere. Bolton’s adaptation to his new life and career in Galway and Connacht weren’t helped by a succession of niggly soft-tissue injuries. He started just 10 games in his first three seasons, but the work with the Connacht strength and conditioning team paid off last season, when he started a dozen games and scored six tries. At the midway point in a World Cup cycle, Bolton’s profile is not hugely dissimilar that of Mack Hansen four years ago; an uncapped Connacht winger from the southern hemisphere with Irish roots who had previously played centre or fullback (Hansen having also played at outhalf). Granted, they’re very different types of players. Hansen is more of a multi-faceted playmaking winger with x-factor. Bolton has been successfully converted into a more straight-running, strong, powerful, quick winger. Though not the tallest, he is good in the air and has an eye for the try line. He is clearly on Andy Farrell’s radar. Bolton scored two tries on his Irish debut in the 106-7 win over Portugal in the summer and was then brought to Chicago to train with the senior squad for two weeks. “I think the preparation is almost more important than the game itself,” says Bolton. “Obviously, we’ve lots of new detail or moves and stuff in the week before the game. Usually with the provinces, all your calls are kind of the same consistently throughout the year, whereas we just have a week now to get that detail, all the moves sorted, how you execute that on the pitch.” Learning and executing details quickly is part of the challenge. “I remember my first time coming in, [my] head was absolutely fried. So many new things to learn. I think it just comes with time, over the weeks you learn, you try and be around the boys a lot, trying to pick up on little small cues in language or language between the boys. “I feel way more comfortable over the last couple of weeks. I know almost everyone now,” says Bolton, who admits he was “very nervous the first time I came in, just trying to be quiet and kind of sneak behind the radar. But now I’m bringing out my personality a bit more”. Does having Blackrock origins earn him kudos with some of his squadmates? “They don’t believe me when I say my family’s from Blackrock,” says Bolton laughing. This week he has been re-routed to Leganés, where he will be part of the Ireland XV team to face Spain on Saturday, (kick-off 5pm local time/4pm Irish time, live on rugbypass). “They’ve qualified for the World Cup,” Bolton notes. “They’re a very good team. It’s going to be a big game. I think it’s going to be very physical. And hopefully we can leave our mark on it.” If Bolton does, it will be another upward step in his Irish graph. “The weather is a challenge,” he says of living in Galway, but “great city to live, class, nothing to complain about”. His family are aboard the journey too. His parents and grandfather all wore Connacht jerseys at the Bulls game in Pretoria two years ago, and his parents have been over to Galway, as well as one of his brothers. His grandmother is “very proud“, he says, smiling. “Sending me messages every game week.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Now she’s ready to move into the ‘new old’ home next door. Grief psychotherapist Liz Gleeson and her family bought their 1879-built home in the seaside town back in 2007 after it had been used for decades as a local dentist’s surgery. The exterior of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow As one of the larger homes in a terrace at Church Road, she believes the property was originally constructed by the Evans family and that after it was completed, two of the builder brothers occupied homes in the terrace themselves – one taking Springmount, the better of the two. “Originally Springmount came with a cottage attached to its grounds as well as an outdoor dairy,” says Gleeson, who is from Blackrock, Co Dublin. These were eventually sold off separately, leaving a large tranch of garden ground at the side of the Gleeson’s home. “The house was in good condition but a lot of its original features had been taken away or altered over the years. We set out to bring it back by replacing and changing out those features that weren’t period correct with originals that we sourced elsewhere.” A big benefit was the presence of the original elaborate marble chimney piece in the front reception. But others had been removed over the years. “And the shutter and sash windows were mostly intact, although sealed up with decades of paint. Once we stripped that back and freed them up, we were delighted to discover that they all worked perfectly. We had to replace a few weights for the sash windows but that wasn’t really a problem. The front room of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow “In the beginning we spent three to four months stripping out fake panelling that had been added at some point, along with filling skips with the old carpets. When we acquired it, I had a two-year-old and our second child had just been born, so we had a lot going on.” The restoration process saw the family scouring markets and antiques dealers and even ditches for period authentic replacement parts and furniture. “One of the period fireplace pieces that we installed we found in a hedge in Maynooth, all covered in rust. We had it cleaned up and replaced the missing tiles with original Victorian hand painted versions we got in salvage. The kitchen of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow “Upstairs, it looked like previous owners had tried to make a self-contained bedsit, and we brought that room back,” says Gleeson. “The stairs’ bannisters had been panelled over and when we removed these we discovered that many of the spindles had also been removed. As an engineer, my father took a spindle away and had identical new replacements made to fill all the gaps. So we eventually got the stairs back looking the way it should.” Since then four Gleeson children have grown up here. “One day I was sitting out in the garden thinking: ‘I could really build a decent sized granny flat here.’ After a time, the idea grew into a full-sized home. So an architect’s firm was engaged and they came up with a contemporary box that never would have gotten planning permission. The bathroom of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow “While I really didn’t want a pastiche, the planners were unlikely to allow something that looked out of place. So I realised we’d have to come up with something that fitted in so well you’d think it was always there.” So ironically, having spent years bringing a modernised period home back to its authentic self, the family now set about building an identical modern home next door which would be as authentically historic as possible. A mirror image of their home in every way. Liz Gleeson. Photo: Bryan Meade However, the family went all out to such a degree that even the windows in the new house were perfectly recreated sash windows, made the same way with weights and pulleys while the front door was hand made as a genuine panel version. “Once we sat down with the planners and explained what we wanted to do, they were very reasonable. All in all, it took three years from planning to completion, which wasn’t at all bad. Mark Smith, our builder, was excellent. He really got into it. We had a newly carved panel door made and got all the brass for it,” says Gleeson. The dining area of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow Today, this looks absolutely identical to the original on Springmount House. “My daughter found enough original Victorian blue banger slates from a source in Kilkenny.” They even replicated the two storey bay window column and door fanlight in the frontage of Springmount. The house was finished in 2023. A bedroom in Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow Now Liz is moving from her authenticated period home into the identical ‘new’ period authentic home next door. And Springmount is being put up for sale: “Much as I don’t want to sell, I really don’t have use for two houses.” The double fronted 2,315 sq ft home includes a big hall, front sitting room; with original marble chimney piece, a drawing room faces the front garden and includes a period tiled chimney piece. Down a half flight of stairs is the kitchen which opens into a dining room with two skylights overhead and a large window into the garden. The entrance hall of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow There’s a dedicated office / study, a utility room, shower room and guest WC on the ground floor. Upstairs there are five bedrooms, one with a walk in dressing room and two full bathrooms. The back rooms have sea views to Bray Head and Howth. “It’s been a fabulous family home and we’ve had christenings, Halloween parties, weddings, Christmas parties. It’s a great house for entertaining. And when I walk out the door I can walk down for my morning swim in the sea in minutes, there’s a sauna three minutes down the road and I can be out on the cliff walks or hop in the car and be in the hills and woodlands around Greystones in no time at all,” says Gleeson. Another advantage for a buyer is that they’ll know who their neighbours are. Sherry FitzGerald seeks €1.2m.

It has been another tough year for restaurants. The closure of Dylan McGrath’s trio, followed by Big Mike’s, underlines how hard it is for independents to hold their ground while big operators and investment funds circle and move in. The good news is that plenty of independents remain, and that’s our focus with this winter list. We’re celebrating the stalwarts who’ve been doing it right for years alongside the new entrants reshaping the dining scene. The list spans casual and buzzy spots, special-occasion rooms, and high-end restaurants that don’t trap you in a tasting menu. Some destinations may raise an eyebrow on price, but set against a weekend abroad, they more than hold their own. Of course, there are more than 100 amazing restaurants in Ireland. These are the ones run with an ethos worth backing – chefs who source quality Irish produce, who lead with integrity and imagination, and who prove that good food and social conscience can go hand in hand. They are the restaurants that remind us why, even in a difficult year, Ireland is still one of the most exciting places to eat. In solidarity with the indies, Corinna, Joanne and Ali. Brazilian chef Viktor Silva brings serious ambition to Harry Street with a €79 tasting menu that feels both creative and generous. The room is elegant – parquet floors, marble bar, high sash windows – and the cooking has flair. Goat’s cheese with okra, strawberry and a clear watermelon consommé is the star on a menu that threads Brazilian ideas throughout, from moqueca-style monkfish to foie gras with coffee. Amai is bold, stylish and one of Dublin’s most exciting new restaurants. Read our review here. Corinna Hardgrave When Argentinian Florencia Matan opened the original Bakeology, it quickly became known for its delicious alfajores filled with dulce de leche and savoury empanadas. Now there’s a second location right across the street, the bright and cheerful brunch-focused Bakeology In. Try the signature Wild Green medialuna, a croissant-like pastry filled with spinach cream, goat’s cheese, honey and walnuts, or the Tango Scramble with avocado sauce and sriracha mayo. Joanne Cronin Located in a formerly vacant warehouse tucked away in the Cathedral Quarter, Lottie Noren’s all-day menu of European small plates has been the recent talk of Belfast. This young chef adeptly combines her experience from across the UK and her time competing for the North on BBC’s Great British Menu. Share plates of beef tartare with beef fat focaccia, lamb rib with hung yoghurt or pressed potato with guanciale cream in a warm and comfortable setting. JC The dream team of Sean Crescenzi and Jamie McCarthy have brought a true taste of Italy to Phibsborough, with a menu running from spuntini and pizzette to house-made pasta and wood-fired mains. If Borgo served nothing but its gambas – prawns seared in lemon, garlic and chilli butter – it would still be worth the trip. It’s that rare restaurant that feels equally right for a quick bite or a long night. Read our review here. CH Lucie and Carlos Capparelli have transformed a restored mill, 20 minutes outside Belfast, into a striking diningroom of glass and wild-flower views. Brazilian-born Carlos spent nine years cooking with Yotam Ottolenghi, who is also a backer of their business. The Italian-influenced menu includes small plates, pasta, mains and rotisserie. Aubergine with goat’s milk yoghurt, beef ragù, and aubergine pasta all impress, and the rotisserie chicken is spectacular. Read our review here. CH Slow-cooked and smoked meats take centre stage at Chubbys, no surprise to fans of chef Barry Stephen’s former 147 Deli and Just Chubbys tacos. The former taco truck’s warehouse is now a snazzy sit-down spot worthy of its big, bold menu, with dishes such as 10-hour smoked short ribs, birria tacos and fried chicken that turn heads as they leave the kitchen. Good beer, wines and zingy cocktails round it all out. Ali Dunworth The quail at Comet tells you everything – deboned, stuffed, lacquered, dripping into milk bread, finished with a vin jaune sauce. Kevin O’Donnell’s cooking is exact, confident, quietly brilliant, with Laura Chabal shaping the wine list and the welcome. This is precision cooking with real personality, backed by Bastible’s Barry and Claremarie FitzGerald, two of the most experienced people in the business. Dublin has a serious new contender. Read our review here. CH [ Three Dublin restaurants added to Michelin GuideOpens in new window ] A combination of restaurant and wine bar, Fawn is the love child of four friends –Hungarians Ervin Vamoser and Maria Ogl, and Irish chefs Jason O’Neill and Sarah Croffey. The quartet bring experience from Michelin three-star dining and a love of cooking over open fire, using the best of local produce. The extensive wine list, with its focus on wine from eastern Europe, grower champagne and French classics, is truly a delight. JC Manifesto may be gone, but its crew return with La Strada in a room that is styled as a Neapolitan backstreet, full of chatter. Just 15 pizzas and wine on tap keep it sharp. Quattro formaggi is indulgent but balanced, Puttanesca deluxe brings a real anchovy bite, and the Peppa Pig pushes potato, smoked mozzarella and porchetta right to the edge of excess. Read our review here. CH [ Restaurant review: Wine on tap and 15 pizzas on the menu at this Naples style Dublin spotOpens in new window ] Ukrainian baker Mykola Kuleshov has slowly bought Ukrainian food to the heart of Dublin. Starting out with a coffee shop, he introduced us to delicious honey and waffle cakes made using recipes from his grandmother Lucy. Daytime dining came next with a menu of borscht, varenyky dumplings, and deruny potato pancakes served with bacon, sour cream and mushrooms. Now open for weekend evenings; make sure to try the chicken Kyiv. JC Opened in June, Priory Market gives migrant-led and small food businesses a foothold – no rent, no fit-out costs – just 15 per cent of turnover in exchange for a unit, utilities and steady footfall. It’s a mix of serious talent under one roof: Delhi2Dublin’s Indian, Bless Up’s Afro-Caribbean, Flavouritos’ Venezuelan, Seoul Kitchen’s Korean, Zaira’s Lebanese-Brazilian, Park 27’s Asian street food, Buongusto’s pasta, Mama’s Boy banh mi, plus El Milagro, Hell Fire Grill and Coke Lane Pizza. Read our review here. CH [ How Irish restaurants are changing to stay afloat: ‘Less people are going out. Thursday is the new Friday’Opens in new window ] Dunlavin native Liam Browne and his wife Tara Lee Logan have breathed new life into a former traditional village pub with a smart new interior and modern Irish cooking. Under chef Darragh Duffy, the restaurant, bar and brunch menus showcase an extensive range of local and Irish producers. With winter around the corner, look out for smoked beef tartare, comforting free-range chicken pot pie and hearty Sunday lunch. JC In a 30-seat cottage once home to Mews restaurant, Baba’de delivers both kebabs and two-star flourishes. Ahmet Dede and Maria Archer’s offshoot swings from crisp bulgur dumplings over yoghurt foam to lamb ragout to squid erişte under whipped red pepper sauce. The Adana kebab is the standout. Some plates look like tasting-menu showpieces, others like late-night favourites – and that mix is the point. Read our review here. CH Dinner here isn’t about choice – it’s about what the boats and farms bring in. Dave Rowley and Siobhán Ward’s three-course menu, served on Friday and Saturday, offers just three dishes per course, changing weekly with produce from Tom Cleary, Tinnock Farm and Riversfield Farm. Expect solid bistro cooking – pork belly with scallop, prosciutto-wrapped monkfish and yoghurt panna cotta with blackberries. By day it’s a cafe, starting with breakfast and moving into lunch. CH Ballycotton’s loss is Midleton’s gain following Cush’s recent move inland. But even so, the lure of the sea remains strong in Dan Guerin’s kitchen with a continued focus on seafood cooking. Ballycotton mackerel is paired with ado blanco, west Cork roast scallop with crown prince pumpkin and wild roast halibut teams up with seaweed butter. Meat lovers can look forward to Skeaghanore duck or a dry-aged beef chop for two from Murphy’s butchers. JC Chef Peter Everett does not offer a tasting menu in his eponymous restaurant but he does offer keenly priced lunch, pre-theatre and lunch menus. When not supporting his favourite Waterford FC, this chef produces elegant modern Irish dishes using local produce such as Wexford scallops, Tuskar crabmeat and Comeragh mountain lamb. It is located in a 15th-century historic building, and the downstairs wine vault room is perfect for parties and large groups. JC Seafood chowder, halibut with leek and mussel sauce, and duck leg confit with spring onion champ tell you what Farmgate is about – local produce cooked without fuss. Owner Sally O’Brien has made a handsome diningroom of this heritage building, with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. Meat comes from McGrath’s butchers in Lismore, fish from Atlantis in Wexford, vegetables from The County Store in Dungarvan and bread from Dún Bakery and Harrington’s. Read our review here. CH At Forêt, the French onion soup is dark as stout and the free-range chicken au vin jaune is succulent, cloaked in bronzed, crackling skin. It is delicious bistro food, which is no surprise, considering the team behind it are John and Sandy Wyer of Forest Avenue. Paul Brogan, who previously worked in Forest Avenue and as head chef in Variety Jones, now heads up the kitchen, using top-quality produce from McNally family farm, Winetavern farm, and Glenmar seafood. Read our review here. CH Chef Aishling Moore’s marvellous seafood-focused restaurant sets a new standard for “catch of the day”. The menu shifts daily and sometimes mid-service, depending on what sustainable fish lands in the kitchen. Paired with local Cork ingredients, it could be served as irresistible Taiwanese fried fish nuggets, silky pâté or perfectly pan-fried whole with melting cafe de Paris butter. This clever, creative cooking makes it tempting to lick your plate clean. Wines served by the glass, pichet or bottle give plenty of options. AD Chef Jess Murphy has long been a high-profile advocate for Irish produce and sustainable cooking. This autumn sees the publication of her latest cookbook, which showcases 100 of Kai’s best-loved recipes. Always creative, dishes such as Cloud Picker pork chop, John Dory with mussels and Madras crazy water, or the perennially popular lunchtime Kai fish fingers with savage cabbage slaw, keep customers coming back for more. JC Eating out should be buzzy and fun, and Kicky’s delivers in spades, from neon interiors to the charming front-of-house team, and then chef Eric Matthews’s flavourful Mediterranean-inspired menu matches the pace. Not-to-be-missed potato focaccia with whipped carbonara butter, well-sourced fish and meats cooked over fire, luscious pastas and playful desserts are all lapped up along with imaginative cocktails and a versatile wine list. Lunch or dinner, it’s a rollicking good time. AD There’s a lot of history baked into the walls of O’Mahony’s. In operation for more than 200 years, this former traditional village pub has been reimagined as a modern Irish restaurant by Máire O’Mahony and Victor Murphy. Enjoy good value comfort dishes at lunchtime, or share small plates a la carte, paired with a low-intervention, small producer wine list, craft beers and creative cocktails. Look out for upcoming pop-ups and Sunday Neapolitan pizzas. JC This place is a joy. Chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez, originally from Spain, brings an authentic Mediterranean influence and combines it with superb ingredients from the rich Cork pantry that surrounds her. There’s excellent fish, of course (you’re in Kinsale), but don’t skip on the vegetables. She does magic things including smoked potatoes, XO tempura broccoli and kohlrabi carpaccio with Bottarga. A dynamic, naturally focused wine list suits this relaxed restaurant. AD Fermentation jars, blueberry hot sauce, chicken karaage, Andarl pork with mole verde – Vada doesn’t waste a scrap, and it shows in the cooking. Sarah Boland and head chef Hannah O’Donnell run the kitchen with a Ballymaloe-meets-Kai ethos: stocks made from trims, oils and vinegars from vegetable scraps, apple cores turned into kombucha. Small plates lead – turbot crudo, stracciatella, with halibut pilaf and Andarl pork for mains, and plum tarte Tatin for dessert. CH Read our review here. Regardless of whether it’s sunny, windy or raining, or possibly even all three at once, a stop at Blackrock Cottage is a must when in Salthill. Open for daytime breakfast and lunch and weekend dinners, chef Michael McManus’s goal is to create memories. Try his elevated classics such salmon with brown bread or seafood chowder, or go for one his Asian-inspired hits. The new covered and heated outdoor area is a welcome addition for walkers and pet-owners. JC Takashi Miyazaki’s casual Japanese restaurant puts a strong focus on sustainable ingredients, but always in a fun and relaxed manner. It’s rare that a chef surrenders a Michelin star, but making that decision has allowed Ichigo Ichie to become a Cork nexus for interesting and tasty food, served with a choice range of natural wines. Star billing goes to the handmade buckwheat noodles, served hot and cold in various dishes. JC Izz is more than a cafe – it’s a vibrant meeting of Cork and Palestinian culture, bursting with hospitality and bold, aromatic dishes. Highlights from chef Eman Aburabi include the popular taster plate of hummus, babaganoush, zingy tabbouleh and warm manaeesh. Don’t skip the Musakhan – roast chicken with sumac and spices baked on bread. AD A Chinese grill house where the skewers are the big draw: cumin-dusted duck tongue, mahogany-skinned quail, and spicy lamb with a smoking fat cap. The sides are no afterthought either: crisp chilli-oil potatoes, bubbling corn-and-cheese, and oyster grilled with garlic and glass noodles. Pair it all with beer, which comes by the pint or in giant self-pour pots. Read our review here. CH Tokyo native and classically trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu is the man behind Matsui Ramen, a real-deal weekend ramen joint tucked away in a Kildare GAA club. Try prawn tuskemen, chilled thick noodles with a rich and savoury prawn broth, or warm up with tantanmen, a creamy and sesame child broth with thin noodles and minced pork. And if you fancy getting your hands on authentic Japanese knives to up your kitchen game, Ken is the man to ask. JC Scéal Cafe’s bright and modern interior with windows overlooking the marina is the perfect backdrop for its laser sharp and utterly moreish viennoiserie and speciality coffee. Shelves are stacked with sourdough loaves, which cut open to reveal glossy bubbly interiors. Owners Charlotte Leonard-Kane and Shane Palmer have generated a cult following from their time in Dublin 8, many of whom gladly make the pilgrimage to Greystones for their flaky pastry fix. This autumn has seen the publication of the Scéal cookbook, showing exactly how it’s all done. JC This slick diningroom is a clever mash-up of the Big Fan crew, Hidden Agenda promoters and Whiplash beer – so you’re set for great food, tunes and drinks. The food does tend to steal the show, though; chefs Alex Zhang and Chun Li bring traditional Chinese cooking techniques together with top Irish produce for lip-smacking, umami-rich dumplings, bao and Xiao Chi. Comfy seats are a big bonus, that is, until the music pulls you up for a dance. Read our review here. AD Tang now has four Dublin locations, including its newest on Windmill Lane. Its familiar Middle Eastern-inspired salads and wraps remain wildly popular, alongside queue-worthy brunch dishes, elevated since chef Keith Coleman (ex-Fumbally and Fia) became executive chef. It serves dinner on Thursday and Friday, moving from its Cumberland Place terrace to indoors on Abbey Street for the winter. Expect more vibrant, colourful plates of Middle Eastern favourites and a lively drinks list. Read our review here. AD Long a tourist town, Killarney has steadily established a quality food and drink scene in recent years. Nowhere embodies this more than Tango, a combination Argentinian parrilla and Neapolitan pizza restaurant from Facundo Rodulfo and Pamela Neumann. A lover of fire and grill, Rodulfo marries his heritage and experiences in beef empanadas, choripan sausage sandwiches and oozing grilled provolone cheese. Look out for Tango’s first cookbook or attend a masterclass to learn the tricks for yourself. JC Breakfast is now served in this restored 1820s coach house, where three fires burn all day. Lunch and dinner bring confit duck croquettes with butternut squash purée, croque monsieur with house-baked ham and Comté, and Kilmore Quay monkfish with charred baby gem. Next door, you’ll find Roundwood Stores bakery offers more casual options. CH Our pizza obsession owes much to brothers Ronan and Eugene Greaney, whose Dough Bros business continues to thrive. This year they opened Lil’ Bros slice shop on Eyre Square, but Middle Street remains the best place to experience their craft – quirky, creative Neapolitan pizzas showcasing top Irish artisan ingredients, cooked fresh and fast in a wood-fired oven. They also offer a stellar list of soft drinks, local beers and quaffable wines. AD You need to prepare yourself for dinner at Aniar where the 2.0 tasting menu delivers an astounding 24 courses, each a showcase for the west of Ireland. Kelp and sea beet rub shoulders with lamb and beef in a menu that covers both sea and land. JP McMahon is not known for sitting still and, in the 14 years that Aniar has been open, he has constantly sought to push boundaries and build an Irish food heritage. JC It has been 30 years since the mother and daughter duo of Ann and Colleen McMahon opened Cafe Rua, followed by a deli-shop in 2008. Now run by Colleen and her brother Aran, the two locations are truly part of the town’s heartbeat. Open for lunch and breakfast, try dishes such as crispy fried egg and pepperonata on Cornrue sourdough toast, or pan-fried hake with hollandaise, Bombay spiced potato and greens. Or simply stop for coffee and some excellent cake. JC When we discuss industry stalwarts, some names just keep coming up. Garrett Byrne’s Campagne is one such spot, with smart, crisp classic cooking that just consistently delivers. Always seasonal, the menu currently features royale of wood pigeon with figs and girolles and slow-cooked duck with aubergines and ceps. With partner Bríd Hannon running the restaurant and superb value set menus, Campagne is always the smart money. JC A 45-year-old multigenerational restaurant, China Sichuan is known for its upmarket Sichuan dishes which incorporate quality Irish ingredients. Try fried soft shell crab with toasted almonds and chilli, Irish lobster with ginger and scallion sauce or tea smoked duck. This year saw the opening of China Sichuan To Go, a casual all-day spot for quick bites or takeaway, but with all of the flair of the original. JC [ China Sichuan to Go takeaway review: The aromatic duck alone is worth the tripOpens in new window ] Every neighbourhood needs a good cafe, one that makes a great cup of coffee and always welcomes you with a smile. Celebrating 15 years in business this year, Foodgame surely meets these requirements. The menu is short but it’s all about the details and the execution. Simple soft scrambled Tolka eggs come with perfectly crisp O’Neill’s bacon, coffee is from Ariosa and the BLT, made with Annie’s Farm organic leaves, proudly declares itself the best in town. JC This Cork favourite still feels fresh after over a decade in business thanks to its ever-evolving wine list and fun approach to dining. The wine list has more than 400 bottles and 30 by the glass in varying sizes. The menu matches adventurous sipping with small plates combining Irish ingredients and European influences. Think spiced beef tongue with sauerkraut and salsa verde, colcannon croquettes and the irresistible winter return of whole baked Mont d’Or. AD Neven and Amelda Maguire are approaching a quarter of a century in business at MacNean House, and its reputation for warm hospitality and generous cooking is as strong as ever. The nine-course Prestige tasting menu offers options for several courses, thus giving diners the best of all worlds. Having trained under the genial Neven himself, chef Carmel McGirr delivers hearty and tasty food that everyone will enjoy. JC [ Neven Maguire on recipes, restaurants and working out to dance records at 6amOpens in new window ] Monty’s of Kathmandu has been flying the Nepalese flag in Temple Bar since 1997 – long before the area became a tourist trap. Shiva and Lina Gautam’s restaurant remains proudly, unmistakably Nepalese; momos steamed to order, smoky breads and kebabs from the charcoal tandoor, goat curry and Nepalese biryani alongside Lina’s sag chat. There’s a two-course midweek menu from €32, but the a la carte is where the cooking shows its depth. An award-winning 85-page wine list starts at €28 and includes icons such as Domaine Romanée-Conti and Château Pétrus. Read our review here. CH Chef Sunil Ghai directly imports rare Indian spices to create a menu that combines north Indian cuisine with the best Irish produce. The result is an invigorating menu full of dishes you’ll want to try – street food snacks, aromatic curries, birianis and the unmissable Goat Keema Pao. The chef’s tasting menu offers a wonderful insight into the inventive cooking here. Portions are generous, service lovely and the food delicious; no wonder it is always busy. AD The Slattery family have been in charge at the Station House since 1984 and under their stewardship this former railway station has been turned into a cozy and bright boutique hotel. The Signal Restaurant celebrates local produce from the surrounding Boyne Valley and all around Ireland. Look out for the regular Boyne Valley dinners in their Signal restaurant which are truly generous, especially when paired with the hotel’s unique wine list. JC The Pig’s Ear went backwards to move forward – who knew it would work so well? After their brief Lotus Eaters phase, Andrea Hussey and Stephen McAllister returned with a new incarnation, diving deep into Dublin’s past. The result is original, personality-led cooking – famine soup with bone marrow toast, Dublin coddle, sharing mulligatawny chicken pie. The generous wine list is put together by people who love wine, boasting 22 by the glass. Alternatively, you could opt for a pint of the black stuff and lean into the auld Dublin vibe. Read our review here. AD Paul and Máire Flynn have been flying the flag for great Irish food and hospitality at the Tannery for more than 20 years. These days they are joined by chef Damien Derwin (ex-Pig’s Ear), who deftly carries on Flynn’s love for robust flavours, classic dishes and shining the light on local suppliers. It’s a popular spot for celebrations and get-togethers because it’s one of those restaurants you know will deliver. Longevity with consistent quality like this should be applauded. AD It’s the mark of a good restaurant that you are drawn there time and time again. Such is the case at John and Tara Coffey’s welcoming spot in the heart of Athlone. Every dish is meticulously presented and worthy of its own Instagram post but, most importantly, also tastes delicious. Try ballotine of quail, brill with dillisk beurre blanc or a slice of Young Buck served with crackers made using spent grain from the brewery next door. JC Chef Chris McGowan doesn’t simply give diners a few dishes from which to choose. Every menu is packed with options, leaving you to wonder how the kitchen manages to do it all. There are always lighter options such as shellfish ravioli with Kilkeel crab or skate wing on the bone, but Wine & Brine really excels in game season, with roast mallard, wood pigeon and partridge all taking their turn to shine. JC This stylish, wood-panelled room is owners Jumoke Akintola and Peter Hogan’s homage to the Spanish tapas bars they love, and it shows in the menu full of top-notch Irish ingredients cooked with plenty of Spanish inspiration. Choose from the chalkboard – oozy croquetas, Connemara oysters, crab sandwich, maybe a stew. Wash it down with something from their 300-plus eclectic wine list, offering 20 or so by the glass, including sparkling, orange wines and sherries. AD There’s a welcome old-school glamour at China Tang and a menu to match. Cantonese dim sum, roasted meats, Sichuan and Hunan dishes are delivered with flair, but the show stopper is the signature roasted Peking duck carved tableside (must be pre-ordered). Bring a gang to work through the extensive menu for a great time. Read our review here. AD This intimate wine bar may be small, but it packs bold flavours and an exceptional wine list curated by co-owner Zsolt Lukács, crowned Michelin sommelier of the year in 2025. Chef Stiofán Feeney’s seasonal small plates, such as polenta cakes with Comté and Dexter beef tartare, build up to a substantial dinner, perfect for pairing with the 40 by-the-glass wine options. Read our review here. AD After a bumpy start in 2024 with a mixed Asian menu, Kaldero smartly relaunched this summer with Bahay – the Irish Filipino concept from chef Richie Castillo and food creative Alex O’Neill. Now it’s all about the dishes for which Castillo is celebrated: golden lumpia spring rolls, rich kare kare braised oxtail with peanut sauce, and inihaw na manok, barbecue chicken skewers glazed with banana ketchup. It’s a wonderful showcase of his Irish and Filipino heritage on a plate. AD Walking past La Gordita takes you immediately to the streets of Spain. The classic wooden and glass exterior beckons you in for a glass of good Spanish red or a nutty amontillado sherry. With a long bar running down the middle and tables at either end, it’s always buzzing. Chef María Luisa Moraleda knows how to deliver a menu of signature dishes such as anchovies with blue cheese butter and ever-changing seasonal specials. JC Lena starts with a sage leaf and an anchovy – fried to a crackle – two bites that set the bar unreachably high. Liz Matthews, Simon Barrett and Paul McNamara – the team behind Etto and Uno Mas – seem incapable of putting a foot wrong. Italian-inspired plates follow: wild sea bass crudo with blood orange and rosemary, pici cacio e pepe that leaves you licking the plate, and halibut with vermouth sauce. No wonder it’s the toughest booking in Dublin right now. It’s the perfect restaurant. Read our review here. CH [ Lena, Portobello review: This is the perfect restaurant, with the best fish dish I have eaten in yearsOpens in new window ] The Great British Menu has been a fantastic showcase for Northern chefs in recent years, most particularly for self-taught Steafan McCarry. Years of innovation for this devotee of fin-to-tail cooking culminated in the overall region win this year. With wife Rebekah, he has added a new events space to Lir, and is looking forward to a winter of special collaboration evenings with other superb local talent. JC Chef Gráinne O’Keefe may have published a book about cooking for one this year, but you’re advised to bring friends or family when dining at Mae. There’s just too much to enjoy solo. The set menu features dishes such as smoked Hegarty’s cheddar agnolotti, brown butter fillet of hake and the decadent tarte Tatin. Diners can choose from a selection of individual handcrafted knives, and the wine pairings from downstairs The French Paradox are unique. JC The hype hasn’t faded – nor should it. Reggie White’s low-waste pizzeria in a reworked redbrick in Rathmines is one of the most exciting rooms in Dublin, humming with families, students and couples sharing bottles of wine over 48-hour fermented wild-farmed sourdough pizzas. The whey-braised leek with Cashel Blue and honey and the Andarl Farm sausage are standouts, and nothing costs more than €18.50. Soon, there’ll be pasta too – because why stop at great pizza? Read our review here. CH The grandeur of this historic 19th-century room is the perfect canvas for chef Adam Nevin’s dynamic cooking. After winning a Michelin star last year, the food featuring exquisite ingredients continues to wow. Go all out with the tasting menu (€150) or visit on Sunday for a pared-back four-course (€95). A champagne trolley and classic wine list with big hitters are fitting partners. AD Leona and Linda are the charming ex-Orient Express carriages that are home to the Pullman restaurant. Reopening this year after an extensive renovation, the two ladies are smarter than ever. Working from an adjacent purpose-built kitchen, chef Angelo Vagiotis, pastry chef Linda Sergidou and the rest of the Pullman team are driving a refined tasting menu experience worthy of the setting, while restaurant manager Ian McDonnell walks the aisles with wines to match. JC Variety Jones may have moved premises and settled into a gorgeous new home on the corner of Thomas Street, but some things will never change. There will always be the signature waffles and pasta on the tasting menu. The sharing main will always be a joyously riotous affair. The wine list is always good. Open-fire cooking is used as much as possible and, in the words of owner Keelan Higgs, “you’re in for a good time, not a long time”. JC Since opening in 2008, Ananda has delivered exceptional Indian food in spectacular surroundings. The elegant and spacious diningroom is a perfect match for the vibrant dishes, be it Goan-style halibut with prawns and lemon leaf bouillabaisse or lentil dumplings with masala Glenilen yoghurt and aged tamarind preserve. Plump for the tasting menu to enjoy the full experience, paired with well-chosen wines. JC A quiet haven for local craftspeople is an appropriate backdrop for Phelim O’Hagan’s restaurant and its keen focus on Northern ingredients. Opened in 2021, a listing in the Michelin guide soon followed, secured via dishes such as Donegal Dexter beef rump with shortrib croquette and Guinness rarebit, butter poached cod with saffron potato and Gubbeen chorizo. JC With muted green walls, blonde wood furniture and plenty of space, the diningroom at Bastible manages to stay on just the right side of austere. The open kitchen takes up the far end, with most diners able to get a good view of the chefs at work. The tasting menu echoes the room, with pared-back dishes that pack quite a punch. Understated, yes, but superbly executed and matched with a very good wine list. Read our review here. JC There are no hushed tones in this two-Michelin-starred diningroom, just warm welcomes and lively service. Beautifully executed dishes, using luxe ingredients, are often swoon-worthy, particularly when it comes to the pastry. The whole thing feels like a seasoned orchestra playing; everything in the room and on the plate is in harmony. Sure, it’s not cheap, but with nothing else like it, it feels worth the spend. AD [ Chapter One chef Mickael Viljanen: ‘I was meant to stay in Ireland for a year and that’s 24 years ago’Opens in new window ] After 20 years, Dax still delivers Dublin’s most refined take on classical French cooking. Graham Neville’s plates – courgette flowers stuffed with Dublin Bay prawns, John Dory, Tipperary beef, and mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb – are elegant and precise. Owner Olivier Meisonnave runs the floor with aplomb and has built one of the country’s great wine lists, stretching from biodynamic bottles to Grand Cru heavyweights. Lunch, from Wednesday to Saturday, is one of the city’s great escapes; dinner carries the same quiet assurance. CH Inside this picture-perfect thatched cottage you’ll find terrific Michelin-starred modern Irish cuisine by chef Robbie McCauley. Seasonal game, Aran turbot, Galway chanterelles and produce from the kitchen garden are crafted into pretty plates of food with real substance. Flagstone floors and open fires set the scene for cosy yet refined dining, matched by a drinks list featuring more than 450 wines. AD Tucked away in one of the darker corners of Blackrock market, the entrance to Liath is brightly illuminated, drawing diners into the comfort inside. Although this is a small restaurant, it is big in attitude and character, with a sublime tasting menu experience. The restaurant’s social media doesn’t profile current dishes, meaning that diners will truly be experiencing dishes for the first time. JC A top spot for modern Irish fine dining with no fuss. Chef-proprietor Kevin Burke and team use lots of local, seasonal ingredients and take a contemporary approach to classic cooking, with delicious results such as turbot head with moreish miso cooked over fire or addictive horseradish choux buns. A thoughtful wine list pairs well with the innovative menu. After four years of refinement, it just keeps getting better and is now happily open on Monday. AD It’s often said that achieving a Michelin star allows a chef to relax. Who knows if it’s true, but Danny Africano’s sleek Lignum is certainly flying high since winning one earlier this year. Cooking over open flame is at the soul of this kitchen, which produces dishes so beautiful you may feel guilty about eating them. The Saturday and Sunday five-course lunch menus offer excellent value. Read our review here. JC It’s always a pleasure to dine at Ox, whether it’s during the daytime with light flooding in through the large windows, or in the evening when a cosier atmosphere settles over the room. Over the years, Stephen Toman and Alain Kerloc’h have never wavered in their dedication to quality. Enjoy classic gougères made with Coolattin cheddar, Thornill duck with hispi and elderberries, and elevated vanilla rice pudding, served with Alain’s wonderful wine pairings. Read our review here. JC The Glass Curtain continues to evolve, having built a solid reputation for large dishes, ideal for sharing around the table, all cooked over open fire. Frequent collaborations bring new ideas to the kitchen, with seasonal and foraged produce at the centre. Brian Murray’s list of suppliers reads like a who’s who of Cork food royalty, and the sleek modern interior is a fun place to be with friends and family. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin one-star restaurant is best known for its €120 tasting menu, but the €75 four-course at 5.45pm shows the same precision in a shorter form. It opens with brown soda bread and house-smoked cultured butter before moving on to dishes that show Krawczyk at his sharpest – native crab with smoked mackerel royale, egg baked in brown butter with trout roe, a loose-crumbed fish cake folded with herbs, and vinegared strawberries and cultured cream. CH Named after the secret Masonic society that met there more than 200 years ago, Gareth McCaughey’s restaurant is certainly no secret to Belfast diners. His philosophy is to keep things simple while using the very best of ingredients. The menu changes regularly, but look out for dishes such as Wicklow venison with beetroot and plum, Mourne lamb with aubergine and miso, or the cherry and tonka bean tart. In a welcome move, there are more than 75 wines available by the glass. JC This cosy city-centre spot has evolved beautifully over five years from brunch cafe to impressive modern Irish bistro. Seasonal, local produce from top Cork suppliers shines in confidently French-inspired cooking. Everything seems to come with an irresistible sauce, dip or side, such as cheesy cheese croquettes with date ketchup, or Anne’s brown bread with burnt onion butter. Bonus points for the natural-wine-focused wine list always having a big by-the-glass selection. AD The sizzle of dosa and steam of chai set the tone – southern Indian cooking that starts at breakfast and doesn’t stop. Mornings bring dosa, idli, vada and uttappam; by lunch it’s biryanis, thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, mutton fry and chicken Chettinadu. The Marlborough Street original now has siblings on Abbey Street and in Belfast, all serving the same deep menu built for repeat visits. Thalis stand out, with Gobi 65, gongura prawns and lamb Chettinadu showing their range. Read our review here. CH On the main street of this planned estate town, Bramley is an elegant and spacious venue serving casual lunch and upscale dinners. Chef Sam Moody brings extensive fine-dining experience to dishes such as a crispy chicken schnitzel Caesar salad, honey-glazed quail and wild Irish venison with spiced date puree. The supper menu available from Wednesday to Friday offers exceptional value, especially when matched with a glass from the well chosen wine list. JC Philip Yueng’s refined neighbourhood restaurant Craft is approaching its 10th birthday and the consensus is that it has never been better. His style of modern Irish food with subtle Asian influences has proven consistently popular with locals. The three-course lunch menu for €25 or evening time chef’s menu for €39 is certainly excellent value, but the a la carte is equally worth a browse. With the winter months drawing in, the return of the Sunday roast is very welcome. JC Few restaurants cook at this level for the money. Kevin and Shirley Stirzake’s €44 and €63 menus get you three courses and a sorbet, with dishes such as Falls goat’s cheese, Keem Bay smoked salmon, West Coast crab, scallops with pork belly, Hereford sirloin and rack of lamb. CH Raffaele Rasso now heads the kitchen at this Michelin Bib Gourmand neighbourhood restaurant, where the early evening menu (€35/€40, Wed-Fri, 5pm-6.30pm) is a bargain. Expect Silverhill duck leg croquettes with fried artichoke, broad bean hummus, chicken thigh with smoked cannellini beans, seabass with kombu gnocchi, and tonka bean panna cotta to finish. CH Usually, we’d slag someone off for having notions in Ireland, but not here. Instead, we’re delighted to see Two Pups cafe on Francis Street transformed after hours into a bistro-style evening restaurant. The casual sharing menu features star suppliers and current Irish menu favourites such as hispi cabbage, oysters, padron peppers and cod roe. Breads come from their own Bold Boy Bakery, and there’s a playful natural wine list. Read our review here. AD Nabbing a window seat here is always a treat, with harbour views over Dún Laoghaire. It’s a hotel restaurant, but it feels more like a buzzy local bistro, with an Italian-leaning menu of Lambay crab arancini, scallops in chicken butter sauce, wood-fired meats, seafood, and rich pastas (the pizzas quietly bowed out this summer). The wine list leans Italian too, with plenty offered by the glass or carafe. AD Rúibín is that rare kind of place where you feel at home from the minute you walk in the door. Maybe it’s the beautiful stone building with even more exposed stone inside. Or maybe it’s the excellent cocktails. Open for lunch, dinner and bar food, Rúibín’s style is contemporary and delicious. Try trout crudo with buttermilk, dill and apple, muscovado-brined pork chop or monkfish fillet with sobrassada butter. JC It’s all go at Conor Halpenny’s Square restaurant, which recently nearly doubled in capacity, while its partnership with local An Táin Arts Centre offers good value pre-theatre dining menus. A former Euro-Toque young chef of the year and current Georgina Campbell chef of the year, Halpenny blends classic techniques with modern trends to create dishes such as Square KFC or monkfish with pickled mussels. JC The combination of outstanding modern Irish dishes from chef Stephen McArdle and exceptional wines from his partner and sommelier Morgan VanderKamer is what makes Union wine bar and restaurant so special. Occupying a former pub, the front is cozy and perfect for a glass of wine while the dining room opens up to the rear. With more than 35 wines available by the glass and a tasty bar bites menu, the Déise is calling. JC Blackrock residents are spoilt to have this as their local spot. Chef Barry Sun’s modern European cooking with Asian influences (there is usually a delicious dumpling on offer) shows up as colourful plates of food full of texture. There’s great value in their €38 neighbourhood four-course menu on Wednesdays and Thursdays and three-course lunch menu on Fridays and Saturdays. Seasonal aperitifs and an interesting wine list make it all the more special. AD © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The erosion of the domestic manufacturing base and the corresponding ascent of real estate as the primary generator of wealth represents a fundamental, structural shift from a productive economy to a rentier economy. This transformation marks a change not merely in what America makes, but in how value is conceived and extracted, creating deep social and political consequences that dwarf the cyclical nature of previous economic downturns. This shift is characterized by the replacement of the wealth-generating factory floor with the wealth-extracting property deed. Historically, the American promise was rooted in productive capitalism, where value was created through labor, skill, and the transformation of raw materials into finished goods. The factory provided stable, high-wage jobs that translated directly into middle-class stability and accessible homeownership. The economic engine was powered by reinvesting profits into innovation and expansion, generating tangible wealth. The city was a center of making things. However, as globalization accelerated and industrial policy waned, manufacturing retreated, leaving vast economic and social vacuums. Into this vacuum stepped the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. The focus shifted from generating profits through production (e.g., selling a car) to generating rents through asset ownership and control (e.g., collecting rent on a portfolio of homes, fees on financial transactions). The critical distinction is that rentier activity extracts existing value without necessarily creating new, productive wealth. Real estate, in particular, became the new economic darling. This was structurally amplified by the complicity of the Democrat and Republican parties and the IRS in ignoring necessary tax code revisions. The unrevised code did not just offer deductions; it created a systemic incentive where the government effectively subsidizes asset ownership. The core loophole is the ability to claim depreciation as a deduction, generating “paper losses” that shield real income from taxation, even as the property itself appreciates in market value. This mechanism encourages wealth-seeking capital to utilize real estate as a shelter from high tax penalties, inflating property values far beyond the reach of local wages. For savvy high-net-worth investors, this loophole is maximized through techniques like cost segregation and bonus depreciation. Cost segregation studies break the property’s value into separate components (like carpeting, appliances, and land improvements) that can be depreciated over short periods (5, 7, or 15 years), rather than the standard 27.5 years for the structure. This accelerated depreciation, often coupled with bonus depreciation rules, creates massive non-cash deductions in the early years of ownership. This results in taxable losses on paper that can offset other forms of income, such as salaries or business profits. In essence, the combination of tax deductions (interest, taxes, maintenance) and non-cash paper losses (depreciation) allows investors to finance the acquisition and holding costs of high-end homes largely through reduced federal tax obligations, making the U.S. government a silent financial co-signer for the rentier class. This ascendancy of rentier wealth is corrosive because it fundamentally severs the link between hard work and economic security. When a city’s health is measured not by its output but by its rising property values, it inevitably privileges the owner and the investor over the producer and the laborer. It creates a state of economic dependence—the non-asset-holding majority must pay rents (housing, fees, interest) to the asset-holding minority. The political landscape becomes dominated by lobbying efforts aimed at protecting asset values and extracting rents (rent-seeking), further distorting governance away from policies focused on productive economic growth. In conclusion, the movement from manufacturing dominance to real estate reliance is far more significant than a simple sectoral transition; it is an ideological pivot from value creation to value extraction—consider the role BlackRock and Vanguard have played in this trend. This shift was tragically facilitated by policy inaction, as the failure to revise the tax code regarding depreciation, cost segregation, and paper losses created the critical loophole that funneled wealth into asset speculation. The resulting structural change—the severe reliance on asset ownership over productive labor—has not only cemented deep inequality but has directly contributed to the social crises we suffer today, most visibly in the proliferation of homelessness and drug epidemics across the nation. This defines the new landscape of wealth and power, suggesting a future where economic gains flow primarily to those who control the ground, not those who build upon it. Image generated by ChatGPT.

Throughout the year, President Donald Trump’s crypto policies have spurred a notable increase in the adoption of digital assets through various channels, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto-focused treasuries. As a result, a recent survey conducted by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and PwC revealed that the percentage of traditional hedge funds holding cryptocurrencies has climbed to 55%, up from 47% in 2024. Despite the ongoing volatility in crypto markets, 47% of institutional investors surveyed expressed that the current regulatory environment, shaped by Trump’s appointments of crypto-friendly agency heads and the implementation of the GENIUS Act has encouraged them to increase their allocations to digital assets. James Delaney, managing director of asset management regulation at AIMA, commented on the findings, stating: For most of these funds, regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier. This year, those barriers are starting to be removed. This year’s report may mark a turning point in overcoming these challenges. However, regulatory clarity isn’t the sole factor driving institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on substantial market gains is also a compelling motivator. The survey highlighted that alongside traditional hedge funds, specialized fund managers with at least 50% of their assets in crypto have emerged, with several new funds launched this year. Among the crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most commonly held asset, closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Notably, Solana saw a surge in popularity this year, with 73% of the funds now holding it, a marked increase from 45% in 2024. On average, hedge funds have allocated about 7% of their assets to crypto, up from 6% the previous year, although over half of the respondents commit less than 2%. Encouragingly, 71% of those surveyed indicated plans to increase their crypto exposure within the next twelve months. Major firms are also showing interest in this space. Brevan Howard Asset Management has reportedly appointed a former executive from Peter Thiel’s family office to lead a crypto-focused investment division. Additionally, asset managers like Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Elliott Investment Management have disclosed holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETFs. According to the AIMA survey, the proportion of respondents using ETFs has risen to 33%, compared to 25% the previous year. The survey indicated that the most popular access method to the digital asset market among managers is through derivatives, with 67% of respondents utilizing them, an increase from 58% in 2024. Spot trading has also grown, rising to 40% from 25%. Moreover, some asset managers are exploring the tokenization of their funds, similar to initiatives by firms like BlackRock. Over half of the survey participants expressed interest in this approach. Lastly, the survey found that 43% of traditional hedge funds investing in crypto plan to enhance or initiate their engagement with DeFi over the next three years, with nearly a third believing that DeFi could disrupt their business models.

Title: BlackRock Exec Drops Trillion-Dollar Revelation At Ripple Swell, But Is XRP Ready?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference in New York has quickly become one of the most talked-about events in the crypto and finance world. Among the highlights was a statement from Maxwell Stein, a member of BlackRock’s digital assets team, that sent the audience into applause and resonated with enthusiasts on social media. He revealed that the global financial market is now ready for large-scale blockchain adoption, and the infrastructure being built by companies like Ripple could soon facilitate the movement of trillions of dollars on-chain. During his session, Stein highlighted the transformation underway in global finance, noting that traditional securities are still held in legacy systems but that this separation between traditional and tokenized assets is gradually disappearing. He explained that in the short term, proving utility is the most important thing to gaining broader adoption and that there are currently two types of users driving this shift: those already in the crypto space and a second wave of early institutional adopters. Stein emphasized the need for continued market momentum to demonstrate the practical usefulness of blockchain solutions and attract larger financial players. “We need that market momentum in order to prove the utility, to actually get the larger players to eventually come in,” he said. As noted by an XRP advocate with the name Diana on the social media platform X, Stein credited Ripple and other early builders for proving that blockchain works. Not as a concept, but as real financial infrastructure. The idea that trillions in capital could eventually move through blockchain rails represents a fundamental change in how the world’s financial systems might operate. The idea sounded like a myth back when the crypto industry was first created. What once seemed like a distant fantasy in crypto’s early days has begun to take shape as reality, and big names like traditional finance are now moving into the crypto industry every day. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also shared her perspective at the event, focusing on the need for regulatory clarity to encourage broader institutional participation in the digital asset space. She explained that major institutions want to engage but require clearly defined rules that prioritize investor protection and establish stable frameworks. According to her, once such clarity is achieved, these institutions can confidently enter the market knowing that they are operating under secure and transparent guidelines. Friedman added that significant progress is already happening within traditional finance, as many banks are experimenting with tokenized bonds, fixed income instruments, and the creation of stablecoins. This growing involvement is evidence that institutions are not waiting for innovation to reach them. They are actively finding ways to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while awaiting the full regulatory go-ahead. “But I think to get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” Friedman said.
