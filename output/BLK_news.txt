When RTÉ began compiling a quarterly register of external activities documenting requests by staff to engage in side hustles, it was assumed the most eager moonlighters would be young influencers with large Instagram followings. On the contrary, it turns out there’s no party like a Marty party when it comes to sideline gigs. The list of staff who requested permission from RTÉ for an outside event during the second and third quarters of last year, released under freedom of information legislation, shows Marty Morrissey is the undisputed king of the liggers. Despite not being a client of agent to the stars Noel Kelly, Morrissey requested permission for five external activities in the second quarter of last year and 22 in the third quarter. RTÉ will not disclose how much staff are paid for their sidelines and will not say whether they were granted or refused permission. Many will presumably be unpaid, including those for charitable causes. Marty’s gigs included emceeing the Repak Environmental Awards in the Shelbourne Hotel and the Supervalu Tidy Town Awards in Croke Park, along with interviewing the cast of Riverdance about their careers. The list for the fourth quarter will presumably include what sounds like his most lucrative outside gig: fronting the Marty Party holiday package in the Costa del Sol last October where holidaymakers were entertained by the likes of Tommy Fleming and Sharon Shannon. Where does he get time for the day job? Not that Morrissey, who had to return his free Renault last year after the Ryan Tubridy payments scandal, was the only sports presenter juggling jobs last year. [ Marty Morrissey: ‘I’m an only child of an only-child dad and an only-child mum. I’ve no aunts, uncles or first cousins’Opens in new window ] The second and third most requests came from the sport department, with presenter Darragh Maloney seeking permission for 17 outside gigs during the two quarters and fellow broadcaster Jacqui Hurley seeking 15, including presumably hard-hitting interviews with retired rugby star Brian O’Driscoll about his Land Rover Defender and Q&As with rugby player James Ryan and jockey Rachel Blackmore on behalf of Volvo. Michael O’Leary is estimated to be worth about €900 million, mostly down to his stake in Ryanair. But he also has an expanding property portfolio with his 2,000-plus acres in Co Westmeath leading to the nickname “The Mullingar Magnier” after the Coolmore Stud boss, who is estimated to own more than 10,000 acres in Co Tipperary. In Dublin, O’Leary owns several period piles which he lets out, including houses on Raglan Road and Clyde Road in Dublin 4. When it comes to pursuing his rent, he’s not shy of a trip to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), the arbiter of landlord-tenant disputes, even if it’s over only €754. Last week the RTB published a judgment following a case taken by Bradley Investments, O’Leary’s investment vehicle, against a couple who underpaid their €2,260 monthly rent at a property his company owns in Blackrock, Dublin by about €754 one month. The couple said they had cut the rent for one month because they had been forced to move out while the house was painted, which took 10 days. They say they initially objected to the house being painted, arguing it would be “too disruptive”. When O’Leary’s company suggested a reduction in their rent for the month of the painting, they said this was “an insult” as it did not include any compensation. However, when Bradley Investments insisted it needed to paint the place, they moved out for 10 days and reduced the amount they paid. At the RTB O’Leary’s representative argued the tenants had rejected the suggestion that a portion of the rent would be waived, adding there was no proof they moved out for the 10-day period and should have paid their rent in full. However, the RTB found in favour of the tenants, ruling O’Leary’s representatives did not have “carte blanche” to carry out painting or repairs at the expense of the tenants’ right to “peaceful occupation”. Perhaps the reason O’Leary was so keen to keep up the house’s appearance was because of a former resident – it’s where his wife Anita Farrell lived before marrying the Mullingar man. Speaking of Coolmore Stud, the latest addition to the board of Horse Racing Ireland is Anne-Marie O’Brien, the wife of Aidan, the trainer at John Magnier’s Ballydoyle Stables. A trainer in her own right, she grew up in the business – her father Joe Crowley was previously Coolmore’s head trainer. She was nominated courtesy of the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and appointed by Minister for Agriculture Martin Heydon, himself from good bloodstock country in Kilcullen, Co Kildare. Hot on the heels of Wanderers FC, Ireland’s second oldest rugby club, getting planning permission for a tricky conversion to their clubhouse on Merrion Road, Old Belvedere has lobbed in an application to expand its own base on Anglesea Road with a larger bar and, of course, three padel courts. The decision to add the padel courts was endorsed by members in a recent egm, with 97 per cent voting for the game that seems to be smashing squash and tennis in the popularity stakes. We can guess which way neighbour Dermot Desmond, an honorary life member of the club and devotee of padel, voted. Rogue lawyer Michael Lynn has obviously been keeping busy in prison reading journalist Michael O’Farrell’s book about him. Fugitive: The Michael Lynn Story was published a year ago by Merrion Press and Irish Academic Press. But it was only last week that Lynn, represented by John P O’Donohoe solicitors in Waterford, filed a High Court defamation action against O’Farrell and the book’s publishers. Perhaps he discovered it in the prison library. Mediahuis boss Peter Vandermeersch has been living in Ireland since taking over as publisher of the Independent stable of newspapers in 2019. Now he is turning his journalist’s eye on the “history, culture and paradoxes” of Ireland in a new book aimed at the Dutch market. Described as “not a classic travel guide”, it is instead “a quest for the soul of Éire”. [ ‘Talbot Street is known as Tablet Street now’: Will a €2m makeover be enough to turn things around?Opens in new window ] We wonder if he’ll mention Talbot Street, his favourite Dublin street and the location of Mediahuis HQ. In a blog post five years ago, he rhapsodised about the cosmopolitan stretch where you will find the most “junkies, nutters and crackpots” in the capital. And no, he wasn’t talking about his colleagues. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Donald Trump delays TikTok ban, but will it remain available in the U.S. in June? The truth behind the decision
URL: https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2025/04/06/67f1a919ca474166468b457b.html

Editions: En/lifestyle/us-news People have been expecting news on this matter President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will delay the enforcement of a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations. The move extends the deadline by 75 days, pushing it to June 18, as discussions continue to determine TikTok's future in the United States. The law, passed in 2024 with bipartisan support, mandates ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese owners or face a nationwide ban. Lawmakers and national security experts have raised concerns over TikTok's data collection practices and ties to the Chinese government, citing the app as a potential risk. ByteDance has pushed back, emphasizing that 60% of its ownership lies with global institutional investors, 20% with its Chinese founders, and the remaining 20% with employees, including those in the U.S. In his post on Truth Social, Trump expressed optimism about progress made toward securing an agreement that would ensure TikTok's continued operation in the U.S. "My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump wrote. "We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal." ByteDance confirmed that negotiations with U.S. officials are ongoing but noted that any deal would require approval under Chinese law. A key sticking point remains TikTok's content-recommendation algorithm, which the U.S. law bars from being controlled by ByteDance but is critical to the app's functionality. China has opposed any sale involving the algorithm, further complicating negotiations. Reports suggest that an agreement to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations into a new company, majority-owned by American investors such as Oracle or Blackrock, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake, was close to being finalized earlier this week. However, the deal hit a roadblock after Trump announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to withhold approval. The tariffs have also spurred financial market volatility, further raising the stakes for the administration. As the June deadline approaches, TikTok's future remains uncertain. The app briefly shut down in January following legal challenges but resumed operations after assurances from Trump that the ban would not be enforced while negotiations continued. ByteDance has described its discussions with the U.S. government as "constructive" but acknowledged unresolved issues. Potential investors such as Oracle, which already hosts TikTok's U.S. user data, and Amazon have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations. With multiple parties involved and diplomatic tensions high, the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether TikTok avoids a ban and secures a path forward in the American market. Trump's decision to delay enforcement reflects the broader complexities of U.S.-China relations, blending national security concerns with economic and political challenges. As the June 18 deadline looms, all eyes will be on Washington and Beijing as they seek a resolution to one of the most contentious tech disputes in recent history. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Title: If Bitcoin Holds This Level Between Now And April 15, Arthur Hayes Says 'We Are Out Of The Woods'

After days of anxious waiting, President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” came and went. As anticipated, equity and cryptocurrency markets did not like the idea of fresh and broad tariffs. A broad market sell-off ensued in after-hours trading as the president read off his chart outlining “reciprocal tariffs” on almost every country in the world, including uninhabited islands. Bitcoin, in particular, dropped 5% from $88,500 to just over $82,000 and continues to trade near these lows, eroding earlier market optimism. Amid the rout, one prominent analyst has pointed to a key level to watch. Don't Miss: According to BitMEX founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes, the $76,500 price point is the level to watch for Bitcoin. “if BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods,” he wrote in a Wednesday X post following Trump’s tariff announcements. Mrkt no likey "Liberation Day", if $BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods. Don't get chopped up! The price level aligns with the three-month price low Bitcoin hit on March 11. On March 20, Hayes speculated that the level was the line in the sand for the asset, suggesting that the worst of the recent correction is over and that it is unlikely the asset will break below the level before making a run for new highs. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? For confirmation of Hayes’ analysis, bulls will want to see a strong bounce from that level should Bitcoin retest it. The analyst’s view comes as he continues to maintain that the leading digital asset is on course to more than double in price this year. Specifically, Hayes maintains that Bitcoin can still hit $250,000 by the end of the year. This prediction is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to pivot from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing due to political pressure as Trump seeks to reduce the U.S.’s trade deficit from 7% to 3% by 2028. In this scenario, the liquidity created is expected to boost risk markets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In the analyst’s telling, this pivot may have already started following remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in March. He announced a slowdown of the central bank's quantitative tightening efforts that kicked off Tuesday while stating that he now expected tariff inflation to be “transitory.” See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. With the move to slow down quantitative tightening, Hayes argued that the apex bank was already on course to create an extra $240 billion in liquidity. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from QT to QE for treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end,” he submitted in an essay released on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hayes’ expectation of greater market liquidity is not limited to the U.S. The analyst also expects China and Europe to join in the money printing—the former to defend the dollar-yuan exchange rate, the latter to build armies as the U.S. under Trump looks set to step back from guaranteeing its protection. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to fall, trading below $82,000 in an over 5% decline over the past 24 hours. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: These 2 Indicators Are Tricking Investors And Costing Them A Fortune

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Shocked upset elderly couple getting bad news, finding fraud, money stealing, loss, overspending, ... More financial problem, holding calculator, using laptop, staring at monitor Most indicators are misleading investors right now, with some looking rosy and others seemingly saying it’s time to panic. So today we’re going to parse through the noise and look at what’s really going on under the hood of the US economy. Then I’m going to give you our latest “CEF Insider intel” on what to do with stocks—and funds (specifically closed-end funds) that hold them. We’re also going to dig into one bond fund yielding an outsized 13% that’s set to benefit as uncertainty grows. Consider the CNN Fear & Greed index, a closely watched sentiment indicator. As I write this, it’s showing a five-alarm fire. Fear & Greed Index Meantime, let’s look at the VIX, the market’s so-called “fear gauge.” You’d think that with the S&P 500 just closing out its worst quarter since 2022, the VIX would be spiking. Instead, crickets. VIX Quiet The VIX, which measures stock volatility, is at 22.3 as I write this—somewhat high territory compared to the last decade, but still pretty low in light of the worry the market has experienced going into April 2 tariff announcements. But in really moody times, this indicator rises to over 25, which it did several times in—you guessed it—2022. I’m guessing that if you’re reading this, you may also be thinking of 2022 right now, since that year also saw fears of inflation and a stagnant economy that caused markets to sell off. So today we’re going to drill into that and look at two reasons why, no, 2025 is not 2022 all over again. We’ll do it by looking at both inflation and stagnation to see if, in fact, either (or both!) are reasons for investors to worry. (Sneak preview: The answer is no—but we do need to be more selective and look at areas beyond stocks, like corporate bonds, including the bond fund we’ll talk about below.) I dislike pointing this out, because I almost always get comments from readers who (rightly!) tell me that prices keep going up in supermarkets and elsewhere. But, well … Inflation, on a year-over-year basis, remains below 3%, according to the consumer price index (CPI). That’s far from the alarming levels we saw in 2022. To be sure, prices are still going up: And as upsetting as that’s been for consumers, the important point for the stock market is the question of how much. We can consider the current rise of 3% year-over-year to be a safe zone. And if you look at the right side of the chart above, you can see that since inflation fell off a cliff in early 2023, it has been slowly (but inconsistently) creeping closer to 2%. The verdict here is clear: Inflation is not trending back to the eye-watering levels we saw in 2022. Yes, we do need to keep an eye on this, but it isn’t reason to panic. But what about the economy as a whole? Earnings Growth Paths BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li pointed to this chart recently when she said in a recent LinkedIn post that corporate earnings are rising “still above the historical trend of 6% to 7%.” In other words, companies are not only growing profits, but they are doing so at a stronger rate than they tend to, on average. It’s also worth noting that the S&P 500 saw earnings rise 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2021, when companies were comparing themselves against the economic shutdowns of 2020. That gives them some additional resilience in the face of tariffs and other unpredictable changes. Investors are totally ignoring that earnings number, as well as the fact that 77% of S&P 500 companies exceeded EPS estimates when they reported earnings in the last quarter. That earnings growth is accompanied by 4.2% revenue growth at the start of 2025 and 2.8% spending growth by consumers after we take inflation into account. I know this is a lot to take in, but the takeaway is that the average American is spending more not just because prices are going up, but because they’re buying more goods and services. Companies, in turn, are taking in more revenue and expanding profit margins. And they’re making their operations more efficient, in turn causing their earnings to rise, too. All of this is good news for investors. So the recent market price decline is a buying opportunity. My beat, of course, is CEFs—often-ignored funds that yield around 8% on average. So let me talk about what all this means for our CEF strategy. The short answer is that we need to be very selective in this environment—and target other corners of the CEF market beyond those funds that hold stocks. In 2025, we’ve seen CEFs hold their own for the most part, with average discounts to net asset value (NAV) for all CEFs around 5%, with stock funds at 6.2%. That might sound generous, but discounts were more like 8.5% in 2022, so this tells us there are fewer CEFs that are generously discounted. This is why we’ve been holding off on adding more equity CEFs to our portfolio this year, choosing to focus instead on corporate-bond CEFs. As I write this, we have just two tickers in our equity-CEF bucket. And we continue to like bond funds—especially those whose managers have been able to buy higher-yielding bonds with long durations. Those bonds are especially well-positioned as interest rates fall (something I see happening as the economy slows, which I expect as we move into the second half of 2025). Case in point: the Nuveen Core Plus Impact Fund (NPCT), a 13%-yielder trading at a 7% discount to NAV today. As I write this, it holds 132 bonds with an average leverage-adjusted effective duration (which measures how much a bond is likely to go up or down in value in relation to interest rates) of 8.7 years. That means NPCT will be able to bring in its bonds’ income streams for nearly a decade. And those bonds’ value will only increase as rates decline. The fact that we can pick this one up at a 7% discount to the value of the bonds it holds is a nice bonus and suggests more price upside ahead.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s barrage of tariffs—with the Federal Reserve poised to blow up the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price dropped sharply after China sparked fears of a “crisis scenario” but has bounced back, breaking its correlation with the stock market. Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock calls bitcoin potentially a “safer bet” than the U.S. dollar, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared bitcoin an emerging “store of value”—comparing it to gold.

More and crypto summit in March ahead of extreme bitcoin price volatility and a looming stock market crash. “Bitcoin is becoming a store of value, gold’s has historically been a store of value,” Bessent told podcaster Tucker Carlson, adding there are “a lot of different stores of value over time.” Bessent’s comments come as stock markets around the world fall sharply in the aftermath of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of trade tariffs that saw the U.S. implement a global baseline import tax of 10% and much higher rates for goods from dozens of countries. “As risk assets continue to sell off, investors may increasingly rotate into traditional hedges like bonds and gold—or into bitcoin, which has shown notable resilience relative to equities in recent days," David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at bitcoin and crypto investment company 21Shares, said via email. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up around 15% so far this year as traders and central banks buy it to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties. “Bitcoin’s price action this week has been a true testament to its investment case as an emerging store of value and potential for uncorrelated returns," Hernandez said. The U.S. stock market has plummeted by around 10% since Trump followed through with his well-telegraphed global tariff regime that was more aggressive than traders had anticipated. Trump himself shared a social media post with a caption reading: “Trump is purposely crashing the market." The bitcoin price has, however, climbed over the course of the week, breaking its recent correlation with the stock market—specifically the tech heavy Nasdaq and the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that includes Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped in recent weeks but has outperformed the "crashing" stock market. "What’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a MAGA problem," Bessent told Carlson, referring to the Trump administration’s Make American Great Again series of policies that are focuses on rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base. “The Trump tariffs have unleashed volatility, notably shaking the U.S. equity markets, but with this, bitcoin’s unique reaction deserves attention,” Joe Burnett, director of market research crypto financial company Unchained, said in emailed comments. "Recalling March 2020, bitcoin rapidly bottomed and recovered first (before U.S. equities), a pattern potentially repeating today as bitcoin hasn’t made new lows since March 11th. This resilience could signal a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Of course, if stocks continue falling aggressively over the coming weeks, it’s reasonable to expect that bitcoin could experience another leg down too.”

Andrew Parish, the founder of x3 and a frequent source of high-level information on X, has stirred the crypto community with his latest claim that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, “will eventually capitulate and offer both XRP and SOL ETF’s.” Parish conveyed that sources close to the matter have told him “crypto floodgates have opened, 2025 filings expected,” while also suggesting that BlackRock leadership has indicated “we may not be first, but we will give clients choices,” and that “if nothing else, both will be included in crypto asset class products” because “crypto assets are an unprecedented growth opportunity.” This is not the first time Parish has shared alleged insider knowledge that turned out to be accurate. On March 17, he posted an update in which he cited “two SEC sources” who believed that the Ripple case was “very close to ending,” adding that these sources expected “XRP to get serious commodity consideration” and a “greatly reduced fine; GREATLY reduced.” He also emphasized that “new leadership knows this case and how they handle it is a big deal; precedent.” Just two days after Parish released that information, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to X to announce that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would drop its appeal, lending credence to Parish’s track record. It is also worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission actually reduced its penalty significantly from $125 million to $50 million, as revealed by Parish. While Parish’s assertion regarding a future spot XRP ETF offering may seem bold, he is not alone in his assessment. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has similarly predicted that BlackRock will seek to expand its crypto footprint beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Geraci noted three weeks ago, “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” pointing out that in his view “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” According to Geraci, BlackRock’s motivation lies in its current dominance by assets in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. He believes the firm will be reluctant to allow competitors to break ground with major altcoin ETFs, stating that “I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s reasoning underscores a notable shift from BlackRock’s previously cautious stance on additional cryptocurrency ETFs. In July of last year, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, Samara Cohen, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no imminent plans to roll out altcoin products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs, reinforced that perspective in December, saying the company was predominantly focused on its existing crypto investment offerings. Additional remarks from Parish reveal that he has been hearing similar timelines and predictions from unnamed “ETF execs in the know.” In one update posted two weeks ago, Parish mentioned anticipating a variety of spot crypto ETF approvals beginning in Q2, including an expected timeframe of “XRP early Q2,” “LTC early Q2,” “SOL late Q2,” and “HBAR early Q3,” while also pointing to the possibility of “basket” crypto ETF products and leveraged long or short funds. His sources, he said, predict that “2025 is the year of crypto ETF’s.” At press time; XRP traded at $2.04 For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

In the end, the make-up of the top four and the Division 1A play-offs in the Energia All-Ireland League did not go down to the wire. Even so, there is some jostling for home semi-finals and the play-off picture throughout the divisions, as well as the AIL qualifiers. St Mary’s (63 points) top 1A after a seven-year absence but travel with a weakened team to second-placed Clontarf (61), who welcome back Ivan Soroka and need a win to ensure a home semi-final. ‘Tarf could be edged out of the top two by Cork Con, who entertain Terenure, finalists for the last three years but who have lost four in a row. After a transformative five seasons as head coach this will be Sean Skehan’s final game before focusing his energies on the rugby programme in the Terenure school. As indicated by a much-changed selection at home to relegated Garryowen, fourth-placed Lansdowne (56) are contentedly in the semi-finals after a run of one defeat in eight. City of Armagh (27 points) can stay above UCD (25) in the relegation play-off place by winning at home to Ballynahinch. After Trinity’s relegation last season, UCD feature eight players on Leinster’s books, including four who featured in the province’s win over the Sharks in Durban last week, for their trek to Young Munster, who are again stacked with Munster players. Old Belvedere have won 1B while Nenagh Ormond have secured second, leaving Blackrock (51 points), Old Wesley (50) and UCC (48) fighting for the remaining two play-off spots. Blackrock host Old Wesley in Stradbrook, where the losers could miss out on the play-offs to UCC if they beat Old Belvedere at home. Last-placed Shannon (24 points) need a bonus-point win at home to Queen’s and hope that Highfield earn nothing from their trek to Naas if the nine-time champions are to avoid successive relegations. Trinity, at home to Nenagh, need to match Highfield’s result to avoid a relegation play-off. In the tussle for the last promotion play-off place in 2A, Corinthians, at home to Ballymena, trail fourth-placed Greystones, away to Navan, on points difference with their opponents fighting to avoid a relegation play-off. UL Bohs, Galwegians and Rainey are competing for the last play-off place in 2B, and face the relegation threatened duo of Sligo and Skerries as well as champions Wanderers. Midleton lead Enniscorthy atop 2C heading into final games away to Monkstown and Belfast Harlequins. In the Qualifying Playoffs, Bective Rangers meet Creggs and Thomond meet Dromore in a double header at Cill Dara RFC, while Enniskillen are seeking promotion to the AIL for the first time when they meet Ennis/Kilrush in Mullingar RFC in the Women’s Qualifying Final.

Title: Sec Hegseth to visit Panama after Trump's demands for canal's return

Gordon Chang, expert on U.S.-China relations, details how Beijing can 'make life very difficult' for firms involved in sale of Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is slated to meet with Panama leaders next week amid President Donald Trump's continued efforts to regain control of the key strategic and military resource. The Trump administration has been outspoken about national security threats presented by alleged Chinese interference. During a February visit to the country, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in an X post that "the United States cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed on Friday the secretary of defense will attend the 2025 Central American Security Conference, participating in discussions that will "drive ongoing efforts to strengthen the U.S.'s partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations," according to a report from the Associated Press. A cargo boat navigates on the Panama Canal next to the expansion project of the Panama Canal on the Pacific side in Panama City, November 17, 2015. (Reuters) PANAMA DENIES STATE DEPT CLAIM THAT IT IS ELIMINATING FEES FOR US GOV VESSELS USING CANAL The president, who has criticized the six-figure premiums imposed on U.S. ships traveling along the vital waterway, previously suggested repurchasing the canal. It was built by the U.S. over the span of multiple decades, but was eventually handed over to Panama during the Carter administration. The "Panama Canal Repurchase Act," a bill that was recently introduced in Congress, would give Trump the authority to negotiate with appropriate Panamanian government officials to reacquire the Panama Canal. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a NATO Defence Ministers meeting at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium on Feb. 13, 2025. (Reuters/Yves Herman) CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK Panama President José Raúl Mulino previously said China does not have influence over the canal and accused Trump of "lying" about potentially acquiring it, according to the AP. BlackRock, Inc. later announced a $23 billion deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson to take ownership of the Panamanian ports of Cristobal and Balboa, along with 43 ports in 23 other countries, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Because, if you ignore today’s vlog and you find yourself in a 15-minute Smart Jones Plantation, with your every move controlled and monitored, and chipped and dipped in whatever lethal poison is best for ‘you and the planet’, you already know what I’ll say: ATOADASO! In today’s video I chatted with my friend of 15 years, Michael Cobb, the ceo of ECI Developments who I met up with yesterday in Nicaragua. We talked about living a high-quality, low cost, healthy lifestyle in an almost secret country in Latin America. I last visited the development in 2018, and now, with over 20 Dollar Vigilantes already living in the community and 20 more having secured their houses, it was amazing to connect with like-minded, free-thinking people taking control of their lives outside the Global Reset realm. It’s incredible how many people are putting their escape plan in place, right now. If I was a gambling man, I would bet this is pretty much the last opportunity to secure off-grid, eco-friendly offshore real estate just a two-minute walk from Nicaragua’s world famous Asuchillo swimming and surf beach. At an unbelievable price with financing options. They even accept crypto and gold. Plus you have the option of getting a residency visa or citizenship!

The USSA is a khazarian-infested death swamp disguised barely with a MAGA cap who wants to replace all living beings with robot armies. Whereas Kanada got rid of Little Castreau only to replace him with a global bankster climate Nazi. And, never forget that Kanadians were voted most likely to turn you in for thinking outside the mainstream narrative, with research showing that most Kanadians support punishing those not following the coronavirus rules in the Covaids scamdemic.

Specialist Anthony Matesic works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, April 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)AP NEW YORK — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6% after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8% to pull more than 20% below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4% from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. It had gone below 3.90% in the morning.\ If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Title: Fidelity Submits Tokenized Market FYHXX to SEC, Sells US Treasury Bills on Ethereum Chain
URL: https://zycrypto.com/fidelity-submits-tokenized-market-fyhxx-to-sec-sells-us-treasury-bills-on-ethereum-chain/
Time Published: 2025-04-04T20:41:44Z
Full Content:
Fidelity Investments, an American asset management company, has applied to register its tokenized U.S. dollar money market blockchain, joining a growing list of businesses that are tokenizing assets. Fidelity registered its blockchain with the SEC, creating a tokenized version of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which contains cash and treasury securities. The SEC filing revealed that Fidelity wishes to create an on-chain share class of its funds, FYHXX, using the Ethereum network but plans to create an independent blockchain. FYHXX will not invest in cryptocurrencies but in cash and U.S. securities. It currently holds 80% in securities. Fidelity made a previous SEC filing before this one to introduce Staking for the Ethereum ETF, attempting to catch up to Blackrock, which was already investing in blockchain technology. Tokenization money funds offer quicker settlement times, direct transactions, 24/7 trading, and more liquidity. Fidelity can take traditional investments like bonds, funds, and credit, place them on the blockchain, and provide better asset access. For Fidelity, Real-World Assets are tokenized using the Ethereum blockchain. FYHXX will provide shareholders with verifiable transactions on the blockchain, keeping track of shares owned, but will be backed up with a traditional method of record keeping. The blockchain, therefore, will not be the official record of shares traded but will be updated daily to reflect the off-chain official record. Further, the U.S. Treasury bills would not be tokenized directly. The dual record model, with the primary record being off-chain and the secondary record being an Ethereum blockchain, could be vital to transitioning to an on-chain primary record. Fidelity, which manages $5.8 trillion, has been lagging behind other companies regarding blockchain adoption. Blackrock runs the money market BUIDL, which holds $1.5 billion in assets. Blackrock has been the leader in asset management, with other contenders following its example. Franklin Templeton has also developed a money market using tokenized funds, with $689 million. Debanking, the phenomenon of banks refusing to finance crypto businesses, didn’t help with adopting tokenized assets. Banks often lumped cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets in the same basket, despite tokenized assets following the same rules as traditional assets. A change in attitude occurred when Blackrock created BUIDL, a tokenized asset class. Many banks prefer AI companies to blockchain-based companies, despite both having varying degrees of risk depending on the underlying business model. “There was no question”, said Robbie Mitchnick, Blackrock’s head of crypto, “that the blockchain we would start our tokenization on would be Ethereum, and that’s not just a BlackRock thing, that’s the natural default answer. Clients clearly are making choices that they do value the decentralization, they do value the credibility, and the security and that’s a great advantage that Ethereum continues to have”.

(AP Photo: Richard Drew) S&P 500 companies have lost over $US4 trillion ($6.5 trillion) in stock market value since China matched US President Trump's tariff increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,054 points overnight, with Wall Street suffering its worst falls since the COVID-19 crash. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was spotted playing golf in Mar-a-Lago after writing on social media that "this is a great time to get rich". Global stock markets and oil prices have tumbled again as China has struck back against US President Donald Trump's tariffs and worries about a prolonged global trade war have mounted. Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market — defined by falling prices of at least 20 per cent from a recent high —while the pan-European STOXX 600 index confirmed it was in a correction as the trade war fanned global recession concerns. The move comes after Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries including China. Since Mr Trump unveiled his tariffs late on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has plunged 2,054 points and S&P 500 companies have lost more than $US4 trillion ($6.5 trillion) in stock market value. It is a record two-day decline for the benchmark and exceeds the two-day loss of $US3.3 trillion in March 2020 when the pandemic ripped across global markets, according to LSEG data compiled by Reuters. Some investors fled to the safety of government bonds, while the dollar recovered from Thursday's weakness. Responding to Mr Trump's tariffs, China on Friday said it would impose additional levies of 34 per cent on American goods, confirming investor fears that a full-blown global trade war was under way. President Donald Trump waves as he arrives at the Trump International Golf Club after announcing widespread tariffs. (AP: Alex Brandon) Mr Trump slapped a 10 per cent tariff on most US imports and much higher levies on dozens of countries, erecting the steepest trade barriers in more than 100 years. The United States and China are the world's two largest economies. Two days after sending the economy reeling, Mr Trump insisted his trade policies would never change.

(AP: Alex Brandon) The president has often proved impervious to the kind of scandals or gaffes that would damage another politician, but his decision to spend the weekend at his gilded properties could test Americans' patience at a time when their retirement savings are evaporating along with the stock market. The tariffs are expected to increase prices by thousands of dollars a year and slow economic growth, and there are fears about a potential recession. Democrats called out Mr Trump for being in a "billionaire bubble", as senator Chuck Schumer put it, while millions watched their investments sink. "While the American people are trying to put food on the table, I see that Donald Trump's out there playing golf," said senator Ben Ray Luján, a Democrat from New Mexico. So far there are few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. European stocks dropped roughly 5 per cent. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war would weaken the global economy. Wondering how Trump's new tariffs were calculated? It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. "It's sort of the worst fears of where the tariff program was headed," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. "For those investors who were sure it was just a negotiation — while that still may be true at some point — it's getting awfully deeper into the detail and more dangerous for companies." Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning's US jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It is the latest signal that the UU job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it's been a linchpin keeping the US economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what's to come. "The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices will likely need to come down even more than they have already.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Panama next week to meet its leaders following recent U.S. allegations of Chinese interference in the operations of the critical Panama Canal shipping lane WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Panama next week to meet with leaders of the Central American country following recent Trump administration allegations of Chinese interference in the operations of the critical Panama Canal shipping lane. President Donald Trump has complained about the U.S. relinquishing control of the waterway to Panama more than 20 years ago and has threatened to retake it, arguing that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Panama’s government has denied Trump's assertion that China exerts influence over the canal. Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that Hegseth will participate in the 2025 Central American Security Conference. He said Hegseth will take part in meetings that “will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations toward our shared vision for a peaceful and secure Western Hemisphere.” He did not mention the canal, which was built by the U.S. in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington turned control over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. After Trump's threats, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control. The deal will give the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction must be approved by Panama’s government, which has maintained that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway. Parnell said Hegseth also will stop at Eglin Air Force Base to visit service members and command leadership at the 7th Special Forces Group. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6% after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8% to pull more than 20% below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected.

The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4% from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. It had gone below 3.90% in the morning.

Posted in: Opinion, streaming, TV, TV | Tagged: opinion, TikTok, trump Donald Trump delayed the deadline on the TikTok ban another 75 days - until mid-June. So far, the Congressional silence has been deafening... When he's not busy tanking the U.S. economy and blowing off the dignified transfer of four American soldiers who died during a training exercise in Lithuania that took place at Delaware's Dover Air Force base earlier today, POtuS Donald Trump is weighing in on the TikTok timeline – and making VVP JD Vance look like an idiot in the process. "My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days," Trump wrote on his version of social media earlier today – meaning the April 5th deadline has now been extended to June 18th. Of course, there are two important factors to keep in mind. First, Trump has no legal authority to do it. TikTok was considered a threat to U.S. security by Congress, which passed a bipartisan bill that was signed into law by President Joseph Biden – you know, the guy behind the economy that Trump has shit away in less than 100 days. But when you have lackeys like Mike Johnson as House Speaker – who clearly doesn't get the concept of "separation of powers" and seems more into the "dictator daddy" vibe – Trump's not going to get any pushback. Of course, if there is a silver lining in all of this mess, it's that Trump made Vance look clueless once again – with Trump's move coming a day after Vance told FOX "News" that a deal would be announced by Saturday (whoops) to keep the app running in the U.S. As for who might end up owning the social media service, it could end up being anyone from Oracle and Blackrock to Amazon, the founder of OnlyFans, ex-L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and others. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Title: Report: Unelected Canada PM Mark Carney Declared 'Strong Confidence' in Investing in China on Beijing Trip
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/04/04/report-unelected-canada-pm-mark-carney-declared-strong-confidence-investing-china-beijing-trip/

Full Content:
Leftist Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who was installed after an internal Liberal Party election in March, “expressed strong confidence in the development prospects and growth potential of investing in China” during a visit to Beijing in October, Canadian outlets recalled this week. The Chinese government summary of his visit to Beijing while serving as an economic adviser to pro-China leftist predecessor Justin Trudeau followed multiple revelations suggesting Carney’s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and its ideology is dangerous close, including his refusal to drop a Liberal Party candidate who called for citizens to capture anti-communist dissidents for a Chinese “bounty” and the securing of a sweetheart loan to his former company, Brookfield Asset Management. It is in his capacity as chairman of Brookfield that Carney visited Beijing and met with its mayor, Yin Yong, in October. Carney is currently in a cutthroat race to keep his appointed prime ministership in an election scheduled for April 28. His most formidable opponent, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, argued on Wednesday that Carney was “compromised by the authoritarian regime in Beijing” – a grave accusation following multiple reports that Canadian intelligence officials have uncovered Chinese regime operations to interfere in Canadian elections. The Canadian outlet Blacklock’s Reporter reported on Tuesday, citing the anti-communist Epoch Times, that Carney “lobbied” the mayor of Beijing during his visit in October. Both reports were based on an article in the Chinese state outlet Beijing Daily published on October 23, 3024, on Yin’s meetings with Carney and the vice chairman of BlackRock, Philipp Hildebrand. The two men were in Beijing to attend the “Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum.” “Yin encouraged Brookfield Asset Management and BlackRock to seize opportunities, tap into their strengths, and increase their investment and business presence in Beijing,” Beijing Daily reported. “He invited both companies to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and share the dividends of Beijing’s high-quality development and high-standard opening-up.” “Both foreign guests expressed strong confidence in the development prospects and growth potential of investing in China,” the report continued. Carney, it claimed, personally “highlighted Brookfield Asset Management’s keen interest in seizing development opportunities in China, further expanding its business in Beijing, and deepening cooperation with relevant partners in areas such as green finance, fund management, and infrastructure investment.” A month after Carney’s visit to Beijing, in November, Brookfield secured a a $276 million 15-year loan with four percent interest, a greatly beneficial deal to the asset manager that Conservatives described as a “sweetheart” agreement. Carney’s visit to China and the massive Brookfield loan occurred after Carney became an official part of the Trudeau government. As the National Post recalled this week, Trudeau offered Carney a job as the leader of a Liberal Party “task force on economic growth.” Carney had previously advised Trudeau on his disastrous response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and on green energy. Poilievre condemned Carney’s relationship with China on Wednesday, describing him as “compromised.” “His company owes the Chinese state-owned bank a quarter billion dollars. He protected a Liberal candidate & MP who said a Canadian citizen should be turned over to Beijing for a bounty,” Poilievre noted. “And now we find out he lobbied the Chinese government weeks before becoming PM to ‘deepen co-operation.’ The Carney Liberals can’t be trusted to keep Canadians safe. They don’t deserve a fourth term.” The “bounty” comment concerned the scandal emerging this week surrounding member of Parliament and now-former Liberal Party candidate Paul Chiang. In January, Chiang had suggested to Chinese-language media that individuals should attempt to abduct his opponent, anti-communist activist Joe Tay, to receive a bounty from the Chinese government. “If anyone here can take [Tay] to the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto, you can get the million-dollar reward,” Chiang said. When the comments emerged in Anglophone media in late March, Carney mildly condemned them but refused to call for Chiang to step down, calling the scandal a “teachable moment.” “He’s made his apology. He’s made it to the public, he’s made it to the individual concerned, he’s made it directly to me, and he’s going to continue with his candidacy,” Carney said. “He has my confidence.” Chiang stepped down anyway on March 31. Brookfield Asset Management is an international company that first invested in China in 2013. According to the website of its Chinese office, it has invested heavily in green energy in China as well as the country’s floundering real estate market. “We have continued to invest in assets that form the backbone of China’s economy across critical industries including logistics, retail, energy and business services,” Brookfield said of itself. Bloomberg News highlighted Brookfield as a company bucking the trend of Western investors fleeing the decaying post-lockdown Chinese economy in May. “There are many global investors that are not interested in China anymore, but there a lot that are,” Brookfield Chief Executive Officer Bruce Flatt said at a panel in Qatar that month, as quoted by Bloomberg. “The local investors have money in China and are doubling down on investing in China.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump said he’s going to delay enforcement of a U.S. law that requires TikTok‘s parent company to sell to non-Chinese owners for another 75 days — setting a new deadline of mid-June. In a post Friday on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.” TikTok had faced a looming April 5 deadline set by Trump to reach a deal that would comply with the U.S. law — or effectively be banned from being hosted or distributed in the country. The app has been painted as a national security threat to the U.S. by many American lawmakers because of its ownership by China’s ByteDance.

It also came as financial markets entered their second day of significant declines in response to Trump’s plan to enact steep tariffs on most countries, including China. A deal led by the Trump administration to spin off TikTok’s U.S. business into a new company — majority-owned by U.S. investors, with ByteDance retaining a stake of less than 20% to comply with the law — had been “largely finalized” Wednesday, including approval from ByteDance, Reuters reported. But the Chinese government refused to sign off on the plan because of Trump’s new tariffs, according to the report. Trump technically does not have authority under the TikTok-targeted legislation, passed in 2024 with bipartisan congressional support and signed by President Biden, to postpone the enforcement of the law. But he continues acting as if he does have the power to forestall an effective nationwide U.S. ban on the popular app while the White House tries to figure out a new American-controlled ownership structure for TikTok. Trump on Friday said negotiations were in progress with China, which has the authority to block any sale of TikTok by ByteDance. The U.S. government’s TikTok divest-or-ban law bars the app from operating in the U.S. if it continues to use the content-recommendation algorithm controlled by ByteDance — while the Chinese government has opposed a TikTok sale that includes the algorithm. A 75-day extension from Friday would make the new deadline June 18. Trump said on Truth Social, “We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security! We do not want TikTok to ‘go dark.’ We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Potential investors in TikTok could include Oracle and Blackrock, which have been reported to be in deal talks. Oracle is seen as logical partner, as the company has an existing agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data. Others that have expressed interest in bidding for TikTok include Amazon, former L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and Tim Stokely, the founder of OnlyFans. Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, ByteDance is required to sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or be outlawed. In January, TikTok lost an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds. It briefly shut down in the U.S. on Jan. 18 but came back online citing Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to find a solution. Apple and Google pulled TikTok from their U.S. app stores amid legal uncertainty over Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok-targeted law, but restored TikTok after assurances from the White House they would not be held criminally liable for doing so. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why Tariffs Make Now A Strategic Time To Buy Bitcoin

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. President Donald Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariffs (Photo by Chip ... More Somodevilla/Getty Images) On April 3, 2025, Wall Street faced its steepest decline since the COVID pandemic, almost exactly five years ago. Following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, which revealed a sweeping set of new tariffs, the market swiftly responded negatively. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4%, and the Nasdaq tumbled 6%. This move ignited fears of a prolonged trade war, fueling concerns about rising inflation and a potential recession. Even gold, which has long been considered a safe haven, tumbled after the announcement. Small-cap stocks suffered the most, with the Russell 2000 down 6.6%. Amid this historic market selloff, one asset stood out for its relative stability: Bitcoin. Though the leading cryptocurrency initially fell 5%, it quickly rebounded and held at around $81K, climbing the following day to over $83K. While almost every other asset class faced steep losses, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain support levels underscored its growing role as a financial alternative in uncertain times. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s resilience is mounting skepticism over the long-term viability of the U.S. dollar. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently raised concerns in his “2025 Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors” that America’s rising debt could threaten its role as the world’s reserve currency. In the letter, Fink states that the U.S. national debt has grown three times the pace of GDP, and this year, interest payments on that debt will exceed $952 billion, more than the country’s defense budget. By 2030, mandatory federal spending and debt service are projected to consume all government revenue. “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control… America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink warned. His comments seem to reflect a growing view among investors who are looking for alternatives to traditional currencies and see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against economic instability. Even as equity markets plunged, Bitcoin remained above key support thresholds, suggesting sustained investor confidence. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the broader selloff that engulfed small-cap and tech stocks. Shares of crypto-exposed companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy fell 7% and 10%, respectively, but Bitcoin itself avoided deeper losses. Tuur Demeester, Bitcoin investor and economist, posted on X, “As the global economy starts to repair decades of resource misallocation, savers increasingly seek refuge in liquid, scarce safe haven assets. Stocks _will_ decouple from bitcoin.” The relatively stable performance suggests investors are viewing Bitcoin not as a speculative bet but as a durable store of value, despite intense market pressure. With over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply already in circulation and the final coins being released at an increasingly slower pace due to programmed halvings every four years, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly scarce asset. Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed supply cap, unlike government-issued currencies subject to inflationary pressures, positions Bitcoin as a strong hedge against currency debasement and a compelling long-term store of value. Author and financial advisor Morgen Rochard said, “Bitcoin isn’t a stock pick. It’s an opt-out button.” As markets reel from geopolitical shocks and fiscal uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly proving itself as more than a speculative asset. It’s becoming a reliable financial alternative. With its fixed supply, growing adoption, and resilience amid chaos, Bitcoin offers investors a way to avoid the volatility of centralized monetary systems. In a world where trust in traditional assets is wavering, owning Bitcoin may be less about chasing returns and more about securing financial sovereignty.

Title: Blockchain Meets Banking: BNY’s Bold Move With BlackRock In Tow

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. unveiled a new blockchain-based tool Friday that posts up-to-date net asset value (NAV) data for tokenized funds directly on a blockchain. According to company officials, BlackRock will be the first client to implement this technology with their on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. According to a report by Fortune, the financial giant’s move comes amid growing acceptance of blockchain technology in traditional finance, supported by favorable regulatory changes under US President Donald Trump’s administration. BNY Mellon temporarily paused its crypto custody services during the Biden Administration after the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance known as SAB 121, which created balance sheet requirements for companies holding crypto assets for clients. In 2024, the bank received an exemption allowing it to custody Bitcoin and Ethereum for exchange-traded products without treating them as balance-sheet liabilities. Under Trump, the SEC quickly rescinded the previous guidance, which was widely unpopular among banks and crypto companies. BNY’s latest crypto product moves beyond custody, and reflects the growth of financial instruments launched on blockchains, such as BlackRock’s on-chain money market fund, BUIDL #BlackRock #BNY #BUIDL #Bitcoin https://t.co/HRHN1RdFM1 — Digital Startup (@digitalstartup5) April 3, 2025 BlackRock, which depends on BNY Mellon as both fund administrator and custodian for its BUIDL fund, will be the first to use the new tool. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, called BNY’s ability to bring off-chain data insights to public blockchains “an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry” in a statement shared with Fortune. The partnership builds on BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public statements supporting increased tokenization of financial assets to improve costs and efficiency. While the technology remains limited to specific test cases and mostly blockchain-native customers, this implementation represents a step toward broader adoption. Caroline Butler, BNY’s head of digital assets, explained in an interview with Fortune that the new product will allow more transparent and current information around tokenized funds. “Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this,” she said. “It sits right in that sweet spot as we continue to add more and more value for clients.” The tool posts NAV information directly to the blockchain instead of relying on third-party accounting services. According to Butler, this helps investors see current NAV values of instruments like BUIDL, which can improve their creditworthiness. While this type of data sharing isn’t unique to crypto, Butler noted that BNY’s blockchain technology enables the company to offer a more complete set of tools for tokenized funds. BNY Mellon’s latest offering represents another step into the blockchain sector, which began in 2008 with Bitcoin’s introduction. Despite market ups and downs, the bank has shown ongoing interest in the technology, including a previous launch of a digital asset custody platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In March, Butler testified before the House Financial Services Committee during a hearing on stablecoins. “Embracing blockchain technology in connecting the traditional and digital markets is consistent with BNY’s long track record of supporting innovation in the global financial system,” she stated at the hearing.

Title: Markets tumble with S&P and Dow down for second day after China matches Trump tariffs

Stan Choe, Associated Press Stan Choe, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. WATCH: Markets plunge in wake of Trump’s new tariffs and fears of global trade war The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8 percent to pull more than 20 percent below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34 percent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34 percent tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4 percent from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7 percent after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12 percent of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16 percent. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5 percent, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8 percent. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01 percent from 4.06 percent late Thursday and from roughly 4.80 percent early this year. It had gone below 3.90 percent in the morning.

Title: Ralph Lauren in Bidding War With LVMH for SoHo Storefront

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy A prominent SoHo corner spot at Prince and Greene streets has been at the center of a bidding war by two luxury brands, but it looks like the longtime occupant, Ralph Lauren, will pay up to keep the space, Commercial Observer has learned. While the ground-floor storefront 109 Prince Street has been occupied by the retailer since 2010, its lease is coming due. French retail giant LVMH has been battling for the space, which LVHM wants for Tiffany & Co., now located at nearby 97 Greene Street. Sources told CO Ralph Lauren will most likely purchase the spot, but it could also turn into a high-priced lease instead. Most retail deals are currently trading at a 6.5 to 8 percent cap rate, according to broker Adelaide Polsinelli of Compass, who marketed the space a decade ago for $54 million with no takers. While unaware of but not involved in the current transaction, she said Ralph Lauren would now command a premium over that range, putting it at a 5 to 5.5 percent cap rate. The Real Estate Board of New York‘s fall report found average retail asking rents along the Broadway corridor in SoHo to be $490 per square foot. Any new starting rent for Ralph Lauren would likely be higher. LVMH has been trying to find a new home for Tiffany for some time, but keeps losing out. Over the last year, the company has tried to lease the former Nespresso store at 92 Prince Street, which was instead leased to Ferrari, as well as the nearby Apple (AAPL) store at 103 Prince Street. That 30,000-square-foot former post office has been occupied by Apple since 2001 and underwent a $30 million expansion and renovation in 2011 when it was purchased by Imperium Capital. With the aggressive LVMH nipping at the bricks, to maintain its space, one real estate source said, “Apple was forced to renew at a rent they didn’t love.” Now it looks like LVMH has lost out on another Prince Street deal and pushed another retailer to pony up. The primary owner of 109 Prince is the Swiss investor and art financier Jean-Pierre Lehmann, who bought the 20,000-square-foot historic cast-iron building in 1991 for $3 million. He completely renovated the French Renaissance-style edifice, first home to silk dealers and later to chemical suppliers, designed by Jarvis Morgan Slade and now part of the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. In 1997, Lehmann sponsored the building as a live-work artist condominium through his company Prince Street Realty, with retail on the ground floor, second floor and lower level, plus three upper-floor residences. In May 2010, records show Ralph Lauren signed a lease for the two retail lots, which had been a Replay store with a café in the lower level. The lease ends in 2026. The ground-floor lot has 3,258 square feet with a retail-friendly, 16-foot-high ceiling and a lower-level cellar spanning 3,386 square feet. The second-story retail condo has 3,265 square feet, and restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten leased it for storage. It could not be determined if he still leases that space. With those leases in hand, however, Lehman reconstituted the ownership entity of the two lots and obtained a mortgage of $18 million. After trying to sell the leased retail for $54 million through Polsinelli, enough interest was generated to up the mortgage in 2014 to $35 million with J.P. Morgan Chase, which pooled it into a commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. In 2016, as Ralph Lauren was closing stores around the country, CO reported that loan could be at risk in 2026 if the retailer did not renew since the store occupied 74.2 percent of the space, with 25.8 percent being occupied by others — presumably Vongerichten. But now the loan appears to be paid off. A Securities and Exchange Commission report from February 2025 said the balance on the one New York retail loan was $29.6 million and had an interest rate of 4.65 percent. Scheduled to mature in January 2026, the loan was anticipated to be repaid in June 2024. While no loan satisfaction has been filed, the report also stated there was an “unscheduled principal” prepayment for a partial liquidation of $156,917, and that the loan was paid through March 1. The upper floors are all residential condominiums. The third floor of the building has been owned since December 1998 by a Fortress Investment Group executive who did not respond to requests for comment. He paid $1.375 million to late art gallery owner Ileana Sonnabend, who had paid $775,000 just a year earlier. She also paid $775,000 for the fourth floor, which she sold back to Lehmann’s entity in mid-1998 for $1.589 million. His entity also still owns the fifth floor that has exclusive use of the roof. Sources said Ralph Lauren is likely negotiating this deal in-house but its spokesperson did not return requests for comment. Lehmann’s attorney and an LVMH spokesperson also did not return requests for comment. Naturally, this deal may still be undone. If inked as a sale, however, it would continue what is now a long trend of retailers buying New York City real estate. Prominent sales to retailers include Prada buying 720 and 724 Fifth Avenue, and a space in 730 Fifth Avenue, from Jeff Sutton for $835 million; Kering paying Sutton $963 million for 100,000 square feet at the base of 717 Fifth Avenue, which it is expected to renovate for Gucci; and James Dyson‘s Weybourne Group picking up 155 Mercer Street for $60 million as well as 770 Madison Avenue from Sutton and the Reuben Brothers for $135 million, where it is expected they will eventually locate Dyson stores. Plus, as CO first reported, Chanel is now negotiating to buy 60,000 square feet of retail in the base of Gary Barnett’s upcoming 655 Madison Avenue luxury residential tower for around $450 million. Barnett has already sold 70,000 square feet at 570 Fifth Avenue to Ikea’s parent for about $400 million. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Sell-off worsens worldwide and Dow drops after China retaliates against Trump' tariffs

Stock markets worldwide are careening even lower Friday after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The S&P 500 was down 5% in morning trading, coming off its worst day since COVID wrecked the global economy in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,656 points, or 4.2%, as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 5.5% lower. So far there are few, if any winners, in financial markets from the trade war. European stocks saw some of the day’s biggest losses, with indexes sinking roughly 5%. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices will likely need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down roughly 16% from its record set in February. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying out some “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Otherwise, many say a recession looks likely. For his part, Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. Vietnam said its deputy prime minister would visit the U.S. for talks on trade, while the head of the European Commission has vowed to fight back. Others have said they were hoping to negotiate with the Trump administration for relief. Trump criticized China's retaliation on Friday, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 16.8% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 14.3% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 13.3%. United Airlines, which is in an alliance with Air China and got a third of its passenger revenue last year from flights across the Pacific, lost 12.6%. In the bond market, Treasury yields continued their sharp drop as worries rise about the strength of the U.S. economy, along with expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to cushion it. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 3.90% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. That’s a major move for the bond market. The Fed could cut its main interest rate to relax the pressure on the economy, as it was doing late last year before pausing in 2025. But it may have less freedom to move than it would like. Lower rates can goose the economy by making it easier for U.S. companies and households to borrow and spend. But they can also push upward on inflation. And worries are already worsening about that because of tariffs, with U.S. households in particular bracing for sharp increases to their bills. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.6% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) HONG KONG – Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6% after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. Recommended Videos The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8% to pull more than 20% below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide.

The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4% from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it.

Title: Jasmine Crockett branded a hypocrite for taking $370k from PACs, business trips to Hamas-supporting Qatar: records

Full Content:
Liberal firebrand Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) took almost $400,000 from political action committees, despite claiming otherwise, documents seen by The Post reveal. A 2020 tweet sent by the 44-year-old congresswoman — recently blasted for referring to disabled Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Hot Wheels” — claimed she had accepted “zero dollars” from corporate PACs while her opposition had taken $192,000. However, campaign finance disclosure data for the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, show a different picture. Disclosures from when she ran for state representative of District 100 in the Dallas area show 22 different entries from donors described as PACs, giving between $500 and $5,000 to her campaign. They include telecoms company AT&T, various teaching associations, a wholesale beer PAC, a Texas trial lawyers PAC and others. Prof. Matthew Foster, a lecturer on government at American University, told The Post: “What’s controversial about [PACs] is people fundamentally see it as an issue of buying one’s support. “Democrats are more sensitive to this. They know people look at their contributions and use them against them. Candidates and campaigns may avoid accepting them because of the optics as the average person fundamentally finds this very icky and sleazy and corrupt. It’s a visceral reaction. “Clearly [Crockett] thinks that issue is a big deal and a way to resonate with voters — so if what they put out there was false, it’s a great opportunity for the opposition to run on that.” Crockett, who previously practiced as a lawyer, draws a $174,000 annual salary as a member of the House of Representatives. She appears to have fully embraced traditional PACs in the years since her tweet. Public records show she accepted more than $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. These have a spending limit and are different from super PACs, which can also donate to political campaigns. Her donors included a mix of PAC and non-PAC donors including pharmaceutical giants including AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services companies BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and RTX, and brands including McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon and Toyota. Crockett did not respond to The Post’s request for comment. Meanwhile, Crockett’s disclosures also show she has received lavish trips while in office. In February 2023, just a month after being elected to the US House, she traveled to Doha, Qatar, at a total cost of about $17,500. The trip was paid for by the US Qatar Business Council, which has ties to the pro-Hamas Qatari government. The disclosure shows that while there, she stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Lusail Doha, a five-star waterfront resort. The trip involved meetings organized by the US-Qatar Business Council between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Crockett also went on cultural exchange trips in 2023 paid for by the Indian and Emirati governments, according to her financial disclosure for that year. Those trips were also paid for by the governments of the respective countries. “At a minimum, it looks horrible … Even if it’s just travel expenses covered and a place to stay overnight,” said Foster. “It’s one of those borderline issues where you can form an argument for either side as to whether or not the member traveled as part of their role, and even if there’s a violation, they’re not always reported to FEC — and that’s why these things easily get dicey. “Anything in-kind — even if it’s a spare house and the foreign government member let them stay overnight or covers their expenses, flights, dinners, these are considered in-kind contributions and treated as if given money. “But even then, it’s where a lot of politicians get in trouble. Because they have to be accounted for. It’s a violation in the spirit of it,” said Foster, although he also pointed out that such gifts weren’t necessarily deemed illegal. Crockett’s trip took place before the Hamas terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7 of that year, which left 1,200 Israelis dead and 250 captured as hostages, some of whom are still being held by the terror group. In the same set of disclosures, Crockett also listed a trip she took to Israel. Advertisement

Title: Why BlackRock boss Larry Fink believes he will win over control of the Panama Canal

Larry Fink is playing the long game. With a little time, a possible nudge from President Trump and some on-the-ground lobbying of his contacts in mainland China, BlackRock’s billionaire boss believes he will win approval from the Mainland’s apparatchiks to take control of the Panama Canal, On The Money has learned. Specifically, Fink is looking to close a $23 billion deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to buy 43 ports worldwide — including the two ports that are strategically located on the Atlantic and Pacific sides of the Panama Canal. Until recently, most people didn’t know much about CK Hutchison, which is headed by the mercurial, 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest tycoon. That was until The Donald began talking up the strategic importance of the Panama Canal, one of the busiest waterways for global trade because it easily connects both oceans through a 51-mile deepwater runway. Hutchison holds long-term leases there and at dozens of others including on the Suez Canal. Its stock traded cheaply, and when Trump began to mouth off about the need to exert US eminence at the Panama Canal (the US, after all, built it and controlled the zone until the 1970s), Blackrock saw a way to make some money and get into Trump’s good graces. The other side of the deal wasn’t so happy. And I’m not talking about Hutchison, but its overlords in the Chinese Communist Party who began to “investigate” the tie-up for God knows what other than to prevent the US from gaining a foothold at this vital waterway. The CCP is now threatening to throttle the entire deal. The people at BlackRock are at least posturing in private conversations that they’re not too worried. They tell On The Money to ignore reports that the deal was set to be officially signed by Wednesday. The real due date is the 145-day “due diligence” period that began when the buyout was announced on March 4. The grace period was designed to ensure a complicated buyout involving dozens of ports in many different countries comported with various laws, including getting buy-in from the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yes, the people at BlackRock said they saw the potential for trouble from China Inc., and they built that into the closing schedule. They believe that over this time, they can get the deal approved by the CCP overlords and put American flags back up in the canal zone. “We are proceeding as if this deal will happen,” a BlackRock executive told On the Money as this column went to press. Of course, things could change given the volatile nature of the relations between China and the US and the frenemy dynamic between Trump and Xi. Trump is said to admire the Chinese strongman (and the feeling seems to be mutual), but wary of his obvious global ambitions. Part of Trump, I am told, will never forgive the Chinese for unleashing COVID on the planet, which on top of all the misery it caused, doomed his re-election chances in 2020. But the BlackRock deal is something Trump covets. He mentioned it in the State of the Union address, no less as proof of an American global renaissance. And people at BlackRock believe the deal will get folded into negotiations with the Chinese over Trump’s plan to save the China-owned short-video app TikTok from being banned from US app stores as early as this weekend, and our overall trade negotiations with the Mainland. Barring some last-minute deal implosion (or a realistic new competing bid, which at this stage is unlikely), the White House is scrambling to unveil a plan for a newish US-investor-controlled TikTok any minute now, a structure, as On The Money reported, that the Trumpers believe will comport with a US law that demands the end of Chinese control. But the Chinese will have some buy-in, as I also reported. That includes possibly a minority stake in the new company and it won’t have to part with its algorithm, the important part of TikTok that gins up user engagement and some say, has allowed the Chinese to spy on US users.

Never miss a story. To get around the ban legislation, tech giant Oracle will be part of the planned new ownership group, but more importantly, monitor the algo in its cloud. To get Xi’s buy-in, the Chinese remain a part of the app’s infrastructure, which can operate in the US and retain its value estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Everybody is happy, the thinking goes, and Xi allows the Hutchison-BlackRock deal to proceed. Maybe it’s all wishful thinking on the part of BlackRock — which I might add is the first US based asset manager to open an office in the Mainland. That means Fink is well versed in Chinese politics and knows how to work the system. Or maybe the Chinese will kill the deal because they’re as leery about US global ambitions as we are of theirs. Either way, I’m here simply to report what’s happening, not what will happen, so stay tuned for more. A BlackRock rep had no comment. Advertisement

Title: How Performative Activism Enabled Mass Persecution

Time Published: 2025-04-04T10:00:00Z

Editor Activism Brownstone Institute, josh stylman Reality engineering requires three components: institutional power to create the narrative, social pressure to enforce it, and the deliberate persecution of anyone who challenges either. The Covid era provided the perfect case study in how this machinery operates—and revealed how performative activism serves as its most potent enforcement mechanism. Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: The financial beneficiaries were clear: During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses. This wasn’t just hypocrisy—it was a calculated consolidation of power under the guise of public health. The corporate duplicity was particularly stark during the same period when America was reckoning with racial justice following George Floyd’s murder. Nike proclaimed “standing against racism” while terminating minority employees who would not comply with unscientific Covid shot mandates. BlackRock published reports on “workplace equity” while creating a segregated office system. Google celebrated “inclusion” while their mandate policies disproportionately excluded minority workers who had historical reasons to distrust medical authorities. These same corporations posting solidarity symbols were forcing their lowest-paid workers to choose between experimental injections or feeding their families. Their DEI committees issued statements about “inclusion” while they excluded anyone who questioned the narrative. They celebrated “diversity” in carefully curated public messaging while their mandates disproportionately impacted minority communities—the very people their DEI initiatives were ostensibly designed to protect. This hypocrisy was essentially economic warfare masked by virtuous platitudes. The professional class’s performative empathy enabled the greatest upward transfer of wealth and opportunity in modern history. Their social media activism provided cover for policies that devastated the working class, particularly in minority communities. While they changed their profile pictures to signal virtue, they changed the economic landscape to enforce dependence. The hypocrisy reached its peak during the Roe v. Wade controversy. The same voices passionately defending bodily autonomy in reproductive rights enthusiastically supported government-mandated medical procedures—often in the same social media feeds. I saw this contradiction clearly one day and shared a meme that captured it perfectly: A woman holding a “My Body, My Choice” sign while wearing a “Vaccine Mandate Now!” t-shirt. The irony was obvious—or so I thought. But instead of engaging with the point, a friend of 20 years replied: “The right to an abortion is at stake and unlike vaccine mandates which remain a choice (granted with heavy weight regarding employment for those who choose against)…Equating the two issues works to piss off women for sure but I don’t think does much to further your cause.” Her response characterized vaccine mandates as merely a “choice with heavy weight” while referring to reproductive rights as “my cause”—as if bodily autonomy were a partisan position rather than a universal principle. Most telling was what happened afterward: when I shared trial data and peer-reviewed studies about fertility concerns, there was no reply. The conversation simply ended. This pattern repeated itself across countless relationships—the desire to maintain a manufactured reality proved stronger than decades of friendship or even scientific evidence that might protect loved ones. A simple observation—one that should have been common sense—was treated as ideological betrayal, even with a good friend. That was the moment I realized how deeply people had internalized the manufactured reality, where pointing out contradictions was itself a crime. While professionals virtue signaled from home offices, essential workers faced impossible choices. Those who built careers championing marginalized communities suddenly celebrated stripping basic rights from their neighbors. It was deeply enlightening to observe those who said they were passionate about fighting discrimination celebrating people losing their jobs for making personal medical choices. Their empathy extended exactly as far as their pharmaceutical stock portfolios and/or unwavering faith in government authority—marching against discrimination until it became inconvenient for their tribal interests, rallying against medical coercion until they could enforce it themselves. The demonization of the non-compliant was systematic and crossed into territory that would be considered hate speech if directed at any other group. Major media outlets competed to express the most vitriolic condemnation of the unvaccinated. The New York Times ran headlines like “I’m Furious at the Unvaccinated, while The Washington Post declared that “remaining unvaccinated in public should be considered as bad as drunk driving.” This wasn’t just media rhetoric—it directly programmed public perception and normalized extreme views. A January 2022 Rasmussen poll revealed that nearly half of Democratic voters supported not just fining the unvaccinated, but confining them to their homes, sending them to quarantine camps, and even taking their children. Public health officials cultivated and then amplified this hostility, speaking of a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” creating a narrative of blame that would be used to justify discrimination at a scale unprecedented in modern America. The rhetoric from entertainment figures was particularly revealing. Gene Simmons declared “You’re willing to walk among us unvaccinated, you are the enemy.” Sean Penn took this mandate mentality further, stating “It seems criminal to me…if someone chooses not to get vaccinated that they should choose to stay home, not go to work, not have a job…As long as we’re all paying for these streets, we got to ride safely on them.” His framing perfectly captured the entitled perspective of the wealthy class—comparing basic employment rights to a privilege that could be revoked for non-compliance. Don Lemon advocated for complete social exclusion: “Don’t have the vaccine, can’t go to the supermarket…Can’t go to the ballgame…Can’t go to work…No shirt, no shoes, no service!” Piers Morgan celebrated discrimination: “Love the idea of COVID vaccine passports for everywhere: flights, clubs, gyms, shops. It’s time COVID denying, anti-vaxxer loonies had their bullshit bluff called.” The dehumanization reached new heights as Jimmy Kimmel mocked the unvaccinated seeking medical care: “Vaccinated person, come right in. Unvaccinated person who gobbled horse goo…Rest in peace, wheezy.” Howard Stern demanded mandatory vaccination while cursing freedom itself: “When are we gonna stop putting up with idiots in this country and just say it’s mandatory to get vaccinated? Fuck ’em, fuck their freedom.” Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who once championed individual rights, declared “Screw your freedom!” These weren’t fringe voices—they were mainstream entertainers with millions of followers, demonstrating how quickly “progressive” entertainment could normalize discrimination and celebrate the stripping of basic human rights. Their audiences, who typically pride themselves on defending the marginalized, cheered calls for persecution when it aligned with their tribal identity and boosted their social capital. ​​The absurdity was obvious to anyone who dared think critically. The architects of this deception are now openly admitting what critics said all along. Janine Small testified before the European Parliament, “No, we did not know whether the vaccine stopped transmission before we rolled it out,” justifying this by saying they had to “move at the speed of science.” These admissions are accelerating. CDC Director Walensky now acknowledges they were “too late” to recognize natural immunity. FDA officials admit myocarditis risks were known earlier than disclosed. Each revelation confirms not just what critics warned about, but what the data had shown from the beginning. Most telling of all, Dr. Deborah Birx, former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator who was one of the chief architects of America’s Covid policies, finally admitted last week: “What we got wrong in public health is we didn’t explain that COVID vaccines were nothing like childhood vaccines…That is not what the COVID vaccine was designed to do. It wasn’t designed against infection.” Yet these admissions come only after the damage is done—after lives were upended, careers destroyed, and basic rights stripped from those who simply pointed to evidence that contradicted the official narrative. For almost five years, anyone pointing out the data and facts now being casually revealed by public health officials faced social and professional exile. The entire justification for mandates, passports, and mass firings was based on claims that public officials and the compliant public never bothered to verify or actively suppressed before coercing millions into compliance. If the vaccines indeed protected the vaccinated, why did anyone else’s medical choices matter? The answer reveals the deeper agenda: This was never about health—it was about enforcing social coercion. As Matt Orfalea brilliantly documented in one of his viral video compilations, media talking heads robotically chanted “no one’s safe unless everyone’s safe,” while a civilized society descended into tribal psychosis. This mass psychosis wasn’t accidental—it was the product of sophisticated reality engineering. The same systems that manufactured consent for endless wars were now deployed to enforce medical and social compliance. But this time, they had new tools: social media algorithms, AI content moderation, and real-time narrative control. And at every level, the deception was coordinated from the top down: Today’s fact-checkers will claim these statements were “taken out of context” but the truth is simpler: These weren’t mistakes or misunderstandings—they were deliberate deceptions designed to drive compliance. Even as internal data contradicted these absolute claims, the messaging remained unwavering. The deception went beyond mere rhetoric. Professor Norman Fenton’s 2021 statistical analysis revealed how trial data was manipulated through deceptive classification of deaths—warnings that were systematically ignored by those who now admit to “mistakes” in coverage. Fenton, along with Professor Martin Neil, has continued this analysis, uncovering progressively more damning evidence of statistical manipulation. Their papers have documented how health authorities systematically misclassified deaths, manipulated test timing, and obscured key data points to maintain the “safe and effective” narrative. Whistleblower Brook Jackson, a regional director at Ventavia Research Group, exposed fundamental violations of data integrity protocols at Pfizer trial sites, including falsified data, improper unblinding of participants, and deliberate suppression of adverse event reporting. Her revelations, which should have immediately halted the trials, were ignored by both the FDA and major media outlets. A forensic analysis of Pfizer’s trial data reveals troubling manipulation. A September 2023 preprint paper titled “Forensic Analysis of the 38 Subject Deaths in the 6-Month Interim Report of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Clinical Trial” documented a subject who was originally in the placebo group but received a Moderna shot on December 23, 2020. This subject was subsequently hospitalized with Covid on December 31, died on January 11, 2021, and was still classified as an ‘unvaccinated death’ despite having received an mRNA vaccine. This deliberate misclassification skewed mortality data in favor of vaccination. Without this manipulation, the data would have shown the vaccinated were 31% more likely to die. This wasn’t an isolated incident. According to Pfizer’s Post-Marketing Experience Report, released under FOIA, 42,086 case reports of adverse effects were submitted in just the first 90 days after release, including 1,223 deaths. Despite these alarming signals—which should have prompted immediate review—the public was repeatedly assured of the product’s safety, while those raising concerns were systematically silenced. ‘Safe and effective’ may very well be the most consequential lie of our lifetime. In fact, the FDA attempted to hide the trial data for 75 years—a stunning admission of what they hoped to conceal. Only through attorney Aaron Siri’s relentless FOIA litigation was the public able to access these documents at all. When finally forced to release it, the documents revealed nine pages of previously hidden side effects. Authors like Ed Dowd and Naomi Wolf have meticulously documented these deceptions. The manipulation continued at every level. Cities like Chicago employed “dastardly definitions” to obscure real data during the Delta wave. But the truth would eventually emerge through institutions too prestigious to ignore. A groundbreaking Cleveland Clinic study of 51,000 employees found the more shots people received, the more likely they were to get Covid-19. In the authors’ own surprised words: “The multivariable analyses found that… the greater the number of vaccine doses previously received, the higher the risk of COVID-19.” Beyond ineffectiveness, safety concerns mounted. A February 2023 peer-reviewed study in the European Heart Journal evaluated 8.9 million young adults from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, finding that “booster dose is associated with increased myocarditis risk in adolescents and young adults.” Among males, a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine was associated with an “increased incidence rate of myocarditis” within 28 days of inoculation. Studies from Thailand and Switzerland showed similar cardiovascular effects. In a sane and just world, these products wouldn’t have been approved in the first place—let alone mandated or defended at all costs. This data directly contradicted every justification used to persecute the unvaccinated. UK Health Security Agency surveillance reports from early 2022 confirmed these findings, showing higher infection rates per 100,000 in many age groups among the triple-vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. In the years since, dozens of peer-reviewed studies from institutions worldwide have consistently validated these observations, forming an overwhelming body of evidence that the original claims about preventing transmission were false. Yet by then, careers had been destroyed, families divided, and lives upended based on a lie. But data manipulation was only one component of a much larger system designed to protect the narrative at all costs. Social media transformed this engineered reality into an automated system. Platform “adjustments” reduced engagement on vaccine-questioning posts by 95%. Shadow-banning isolated critics while amplifying approved narratives, creating an artificial consensus. AI content moderation ensured only pharmaceutical-friendly perspectives reached wide audiences. The financial entanglement between media and pharma completed the cycle of influence: This wasn’t just bias—it was a carefully structured ecosystem of self-interest. The same system that enriched Halliburton through endless wars now enriched Pfizer through endless boosters. The military-industrial complex had found its medical counterpart. The companies selling vaccines controlled the channels reporting on their safety, creating a perfect closed loop of propaganda: from corporate press release to news headline to social media share to fact-checker verification to public policy. The selective amplification of narratives isn’t an accident—it’s an integral part of reality engineering. Consider this: just last week, West Texas had 58 measles cases, some in the vaccinated, and it made national headlines. Meanwhile, VAERS reports 2,659,050 adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines (including 38,398 deaths) and it’s ignored. The media treats one as a crisis and the other as a conspiracy theory. While VAERS is designed as an early warning system rather than a definitive assessment tool, the stark contrast in how these safety signals were treated compared to other vaccines reveals a troubling double standard in safety monitoring. And that’s before we account for the fact that VAERS is notoriously underreported. This coordinated messaging wasn’t coincidental. A well-documented revolving door between regulators and pharmaceutical companies solidified their dominance over public health narratives. This circular system extended to news coverage itself. Would the public have maintained faith in the “official narrative” if they understood that the “impartial” journalists delivering it had their salaries substantially funded by pharmaceutical advertising? Pfizer alone spent $2.4 billion on TV advertising in 2021. Every “breaking news” segment about the pandemic was effectively “brought to you by Pfizer“—the same company profiting from the promoted solutions. This wasn’t mere bias; it was a fundamental conflict of interest that transformed news programs into pharmaceutical marketing channels with a veneer of journalistic credibility. The legal framework itself exposed the deception. These weren’t medical products subject to normal safety protocols—they were military countermeasures, allowing manufacturers to bypass regulations while enjoying complete liability protection. On February 4, 2020, with fewer than a dozen confirmed Covid cases and zero deaths, the Department of Defense declared it a “national security threat” and activated emergency powers designed for weapons of mass destruction. Science took a back seat to military protocols, with unprecedented emergency declarations occurring in lockstep across countries. Even the language itself was manipulated to accommodate these novel products. The CDC quietly changed the definition of “vaccination” multiple times: from “the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease” to simply “producing protection”—a subtle but critical shift that lowered the bar from actual immunity to mere “protection.” This wasn’t semantic nitpicking—it was a deliberate reframing to retrofit the definition around products that couldn’t meet the traditional standard. By changing the very meaning of “vaccine,” they could claim these gene therapy products belonged in the same category as traditional vaccines, despite their fundamentally different mechanisms and outcomes. The implementation of this control architecture wasn’t improvised—it followed a detailed playbook established before the crisis. Event 201’s recommendations went far beyond theoretical discussions about “misinformation.” The simulation explicitly outlined tactics that would later be deployed: Most disturbing was how precisely these tactics were deployed against the vaccine-injured. Just as the simulation had rehearsed, those reporting adverse effects were systematically labeled as spreaders of “misinformation”—precisely as the blueprint had prescribed. The synchronized global response demonstrated unprecedented coordination across political and geographical boundaries. World leaders simultaneously adopted identical phrases like “Build Back Better,” while implementing remarkably similar policies, regardless of their political orientation or their countries’ specific circumstances. This perfect alignment of messaging and policy represents a level of international coordination never before witnessed—suggesting either an extraordinary coincidence or deliberate orchestration beyond national interests. How does a democratically established public health policy manifest identically across dozens of culturally and politically diverse nations? The answer lies in pre-crisis planning through non-governmental organizations and unelected global institutions. This wasn’t an accident. It was a deliberate construction. Reality itself became a manufactured product, shaped and reinforced through social media algorithms, legacy media narratives, and censorship infrastructure. It was no longer about individual facts—it was about the entire context in which those facts existed. The terrifying part is that once you’re locked into one of these timelines, breaking out feels impossible. Not because people are incapable of critical thinking, but because they are only given the pieces of the puzzle that fit their pre-constructed reality. If your entire media environment tells you vaccine passports were necessary to save lives, then anyone who opposes them must be selfish or dangerous. If your reality tells you vaccine injuries are a rare anomaly, then the people raising concerns must be crackpot lunatics. Once the stage has been set, people don’t need to be actively deceived—they simply need to never see the information that contradicts their version of reality. And the scariest part? This isn’t just about Covid. This is now the model for shaping public perception on every issue. We don’t just live in an era of misinformation. We live in an era where entire realities are constructed and assigned to us, and stepping outside of them comes at a personal and social cost. It’s not just that people were manipulated. It’s that they were placed inside an entirely different timeline—one where dissent itself is unthinkable. Perhaps most chilling is the complete absence of informed consent. The crisis revealed how quickly we abandoned our most sacred protections. The First Amendment wasn’t just challenged—it was systematically dismantled. Free speech, designed to protect the flow of information and allow people to hear all sides, was replaced with coordinated censorship. The same voices who once defended “speaking truth to power” now demanded power to silence dissent. These actions violated not just ethics, but the foundational principles established after World War II to prevent exactly this kind of coercion. The very protections created to prevent medical experimentation without consent were themselves abused. The public was never told they were participating in what amounts to the largest medical experiment in human history. The formulation that received FDA approval was never actually administered—a bait-and-switch that would be criminal in any other context. We still lack proper testing data, with the general population serving as unwitting test subjects. The absence of informed consent was particularly egregious for pregnant women and those of childbearing age. Pfizer’s own December 2020 documents, published by the UK government, recommended against administering these shots to pregnant and breastfeeding women. Their trial informed consent documents explicitly stated: Yet public health officials aggressively promoted these products to pregnant women and young girls without disclosing these warnings. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) rapidly reversed decades of cautious protocol by recommending these products for pregnant women in July 2021, despite the absence of completed clinical trials in this population. This unprecedented departure from established safety procedures placed an entire generation of mothers and their unborn children in an uncontrolled experiment. Those who raised concerns about giving experimental drugs to expecting mothers were branded as dangerous misinformation spreaders. Most shocking of all, the “studies” used to justify safety in pregnancy weren’t conducted on pregnant women at all—they were only done on mice. The medical establishment that once adhered to the precautionary principle of “first, do no harm” now embraced an unprecedented experiment on the reproductive health of an entire generation. VAERS reports of miscarriages and stillbirths increased by 450% in 2022 compared to the previous decade’s baseline. While similar vaccines showed no such signal, authorities dismissed these reports without investigation. The same voices that popularized “believe women” suddenly found endless reasons to doubt women’s experiences when they contradicted pharmaceutical interests—just as my friend had dismissed the contradiction between forced medical procedures and bodily autonomy. While the CDC and public health officials kept assuring the public that the mRNA stayed isolated to the injection site, Moderna’s pitch to Wall Street told a very different story. In a presentation to investors (later removed from their website but archived via the Wayback Machine), Moderna openly boasted about their technology’s ability to deliver mRNA to bone marrow, leading to “HSPC transfection and long-term modulation of all hematopoietic lineages.” Their slides proudly displayed how different LNP (lipid nanoparticle) formulations and repeat dosing could “enhance transfection” across various systems, including bone marrow and human HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) in “humanized-mouse model systems.” And BioNTech’s SEC filings were equally revealing. The company warned investors about “irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell” and the need for “additional testing for long-term side effects.” As Bayer’s pharmaceutical director Stefan Oelrich would later admit, these were indeed gene therapy products—exactly what the public was condemned for suggesting. The semantic debate over terminology served primarily to obscure the novel mechanism of action from the public. The duplicity is breathtaking. One narrative for the public, another for investors. One story about safety for mass consumption, another about risks and biological impact for those funding the operation. The public was not only denied informed consent – they were actively misinformed about the nature of what was being injected into their bodies. I witnessed these stories firsthand while working with filmmaker Jennifer Sharp on her groundbreaking documentary “Anecdotals.” The film provided a nuanced, human lens into the experiences of the vaccine-injured—individuals who trusted the system and paid a devastating price. These weren’t distant statistics or “rare cases” easily dismissed by pharmaceutical companies; they were real people whose lives were upended, first by injury and then by a system that refused to acknowledge their existence. The film’s power lies in giving voice to those who have been systematically silenced. Despite attempts to discredit their experiences as “just anecdotes,” these stories reveal a pattern that can no longer be ignored. Recently, even prestigious mainstream institutions have been forced to acknowledge the reality of persistent vaccine injuries. Multiple research initiatives, including a Yale University study, have begun documenting what was previously dismissed: spike protein persistence long after vaccination, chronic inflammation, immune system disruption, and reactivation of dormant viruses. Yet even as evidence mounts, the truth is often packaged and monetized by the very institutions that denied it initially. Research validating vaccine injuries becomes a commodity, with suffering participants treated as data points rather than patients needing care. Some participants have even withdrawn from these studies, alleging that researchers seem more interested in managing the narrative than addressing their medical needs. For people like Lyndsey, a registered nurse and whistleblower who has documented continuous spike protein production for over 1,500 days since her December 2020 vaccination, these academic acknowledgments come too late and offer too little. Her lab results consistently show immune system dysfunction and inflammatory markers that align with emerging research findings, yet comprehensive treatment remains elusive. These aren’t just statistics or distant characters—they’re our neighbors, friends, and family members who trusted the system and paid an unthinkable price. They don’t need virtual sympathy or performative gestures. They need medical research into treatments. They need financial support for care. Most importantly, they need us to ensure this never happens again. Yet instead of support, those who spoke out faced persecution. The machinery that silenced the injured also targeted anyone who questioned the narrative. I experienced this mob mentality in action when I dared question the prevailing narrative. In 2022, posted what I thought was thoughtful thread comparing vaccine passports to historical patterns of discrimination. As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I carefully noted that I wasn’t comparing current events to 1943 Germany, but rather warning about how societies normalize discrimination through incremental steps—the exact process that began in 1933. The response proved my point perfectly. The New York Times published a story that left out the historical context of my explanation. A mob formed demanding my resignation from the brewery I had built over a decade. Thousands of messages exist on the Internet about what a horrible person I am. After a successful two decade career in tech and then with the brewery, if you Google my name, most of the content describes a person I don’t recognize. This wasn’t just cancellation—it was digital character assassination. Some friends never spoke to me again. My crime wasn’t comparing current events to the Holocaust’s horrors (never once did I invoke the Holocaust), but rather daring to point out how “checkpoint societies” begin: with the normalization of discriminating against a group by suggesting they pose a threat to public health. The historical parallels were impossible to ignore—yet most disturbing was how few people recognized them. A generation raised without understanding history, critical thinking, or basic scientific principles couldn’t see the patterns repeating before their eyes. Nazi propaganda had portrayed Jews as spreaders of typhus. Now, mainstream media outlets portrayed the unvaccinated as spreaders of Covid, despite clear evidence that vaccination status had no impact on transmission. In both cases, pseudo-scientific claims about public health were used to justify stripping basic rights from a targeted group. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Across the country, professionals who raised concerns faced similar campaigns of intimidation: The pattern was always the same: first the media distortion, then the mob, then the institutional pressure. It is a dangerous world where we cannot say what we believe is right out of fear of losing everything we worked so hard to build. Reality used to be something we shared. Not anymore. In the past few years, we have witnessed something unprecedented: the deliberate fracturing of reality into separate, incompatible timelines. Not based on geography or culture, but based entirely on information streams. In one timeline, the past few years were defined by a heroic global effort to stop a deadly pandemic. Governments acted with urgency, the vaccines were a miraculous solution that saved lives, and those who refused them were reckless threats to public safety. In another timeline, the same period was a coordinated mass psychological operation—one that justified authoritarian overreach, rewrote the social contract, and gaslit the injured while funneling trillions of dollars to corporations. This timeline fracturing represents reality engineering’s ultimate achievement—not just controlling information, but creating entirely separate perceptual worlds where the same events have fundamentally different meanings. When reality itself becomes a manufactured product, traditional concepts of truth and evidence no longer function as social anchors. Depending on which timeline you were placed in, your entire understanding of the world—who was good, who was evil, what was truth—was predetermined. This timeline fracturing represents reality engineering’s ultimate achievement—not just controlling information, but creating entirely separate perceptual worlds where the same events have fundamentally different meanings. When reality itself becomes a manufactured product, traditional concepts of truth and evidence no longer function as social anchors. Depending on which timeline you were placed in, your entire understanding of the world—who was good, who was evil, what was truth—was predetermined. I get it—because I was duped too. I believed them. I was stupid enough to get “vaccinated” without questioning (or really, even looking at) the data. It wasn’t until days later, after a friend pushed me to dig deeper, that I realized I had injected something into my body without any real understanding of what it was. And when I looked at the evidence, I felt betrayed. The difference is, I was willing to admit I was wrong. Others still can’t, because it would mean acknowledging they participated in something unforgivable. It’s not just about ego—it’s about identity. To admit they were wrong means confronting the fact that they enforced a system of persecution against their own friends, family, and neighbors. So instead, they double down. Like victims of Stockholm syndrome, they became ardent defenders of the system that harmed them. Even after being lied to, coerced, and in many cases injured, they couldn’t break free from their psychological captivity. Because once you’ve helped enforce injustice, admitting the truth means confronting your own complicity in mass discrimination. Some relationships are irretrievably lost. Not because we changed, but because acknowledging the truth would require dismantling their entire worldview. They’re trapped in a reality we can no longer share. The path to justice requires dismantling both the machinery of reality engineering and its social enforcement mechanisms. We must acknowledge not just the reality of vaccine injuries—now validated by premier research institutions—but the broader system that made their persecution possible. This means creating spaces where suppressed experiences can be shared without fear, challenging the systemic gaslighting of victims, and demanding accountability from both the architects of this deception and those who enforced it through performative compliance. Real resistance requires exposing the conflicts of interest that drive reality engineering, from pharmaceutical profits to military agendas. Most crucially, we must establish safeguards against the weaponization of social consensus for medical coercion. This includes the ways institutions co-opt and control even the recognition of their own wrongdoing. When prestigious universities finally validate what the injured have been saying for years, it comes with strings attached: data monetization, narrative control, careful limitation of scope. Real justice isn’t just about acknowledgment—it’s about full disclosure and actual care for the injured. To those who now post about the next trending cause while pretending the last few years never happened: Your performative activism has been exposed for what it always was—a social fashion accessory, discarded the moment real courage was required. You’ve lost all credibility to speak about inclusion, justice, or human rights. You didn’t just observe discrimination—you celebrated it. You didn’t just ignore medical coercion—you demanded it. You didn’t just witness the silencing of the injured – you actively participated in it. The pandemic exposed a fundamental truth about modern activism: those who perform virtue the loudest often enable harm the most enthusiastically. The same voices that change their social media profiles for every trending cause revealed themselves as eager participants in actual discrimination when it aligned with their tribal interests. Their commitment to human rights extended exactly as far as their perceived social standing and engagement metrics. This wasn’t just hypocrisy—it was a complete moral collapse masked by algorithmic theater. The Instagram-ification of protest, the reduction of resistance to hashtags, the substitution of profile picture frames for principle—all of it served to create the illusion of justice while enabling its opposite. Real resistance isn’t about social media gestures or convenient forgiveness – it’s about standing firm against oppression, even when—especially when—that oppression comes wrapped in the language of public good. The unvaccinated and vaccine-injured represent the most brutally marginalized groups in recent American history. The scale of this systematic exclusion was unprecedented in modern America: No other group in recent history has faced such comprehensive banishment from society—excluded from workplaces, education, travel, entertainment, and even basic medical care, all while being publicly demonized by mainstream media and entertainment figures. Their story isn’t trending. Their flag isn’t fashionable. Their cause won’t get you likes. But ignoring them doesn’t erase what happened. The same people who loudly signaled their virtue with their vaccine selfies now pretend the past five years never happened. But we remember. And we won’t let them rewrite history. Today, many of those same enforcers have moved on to their next causes—whatever generates the most engagement, whatever lets them perform virtue without risking anything real. But there can be no moving forward without reconciliation. The machinery of social coercion they so eagerly operated stands exposed. Their poses of moral virtue lie in ruins. The next time they change their profile picture for some fashionable cause, remember: They already showed us who they really are when ostracizing dissenters was trending. This isn’t over. The system that turned neighbors against each other remains in place, waiting for the next crisis to weaponize empathy into compliance. We must act now to prevent the next manufactured crisis. This means demanding complete transparency from public health institutions, supporting independent research into treatments for the vaccine-injured, creating legal protections for medical autonomy, and building information networks resistant to censorship. Most importantly, it means holding accountable those who knowingly deceived the public—not through vengeance, but through a truth and reconciliation process that ensures such widespread harm never happens again. The only question is: next time, will you recognize it happening? And if you comply again, what will be left of your humanity when it’s over? True solidarity isn’t measured by profile pictures or hashtags, but by the willingness to stand against injustice when it costs you something. During Covid, genuine allies wouldn’t have been posting selfies with vaccine cards, but rather demanding transparency when the injured were silenced, questioning disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities, and refusing to participate in segregating society—even at the cost of their social standing. They would have recognized that human rights aren’t partisan luxuries that apply only to favored groups, but universal principles that matter most when they’re inconvenient. They would have seen that discrimination dressed in the language of public health is still discrimination. Instead, most self-proclaimed activists failed the most significant civil rights test of our generation, revealing that their commitment to justice extended precisely as far as their social media engagement metrics. The next time a crisis emerges and you’re told who to fear, who to exclude, and which questions not to ask, remember: courage isn’t joining the chorus of the comfortable—it’s speaking truth when the consequences are real. History will remember not just who enforced injustice, but who remained silent as it happened. The long-term damage extends beyond the immediate casualties. Public health institutions have destroyed decades of accumulated trust through their willing participation in deception. The next genuine health crisis will be met with justified skepticism by millions who witnessed this betrayal. Medical authorities have traded long-term credibility for short-term compliance, creating a dangerous void where every health recommendation will now be questioned, regardless of merit. Rebuilding this trust will require not just new leadership, but institutional transparency, accountability for past actions, and the restoration of principles like informed consent and data integrity as non-negotiable foundations of public health.

Bengaluru-based People Tree Hospital secures ₹220 crore investment from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, to expand its capacity to 400 beds and transform Super specialty & Oncology care. This marks BlackRock’s first foray into the Indian healthcare sector, facilitated through the People Tree Hospital platform. The investment—comprising ₹220 crore in the first tranche enables further expansion and a promoter led buyout and seamless exit to early-stage investor & Infosys co-founder, Kris Gopalakrishnan. BlackRock has also made a commitment to invest another ₹210 crore as a green shoe option in the second tranche taking the total funding to ₹430 Crores or 50 Million USD. This will drive expansion, operational growth, and the development of cutting-edge super-specialty and oncology care in India. “This investment from BlackRock will enable the hospital to expand by an additional 250 beds which will support specialties including Oncology, Radiation Oncology, PET-CT, Heart, Lung, and Liver Transplants, as well as Hematology & Bone Marrow Transplants,” said Dr. Jothi Neeraja, MD & CEO of People Tree Hospitals. “Future Plans include a 200-bed super-specialty hospital in a prime location at KR Puram, along with a projected expansion of total bed capacity from 300 to 800 across Bengaluru within the next 2–3 years,” said Dr. Upendra Kandluri. Founded by Dr. Jothi Neeraja and Dr. Upendra Kandluri, People Tree Hospital stands as a beacon of promoter-owned assets, ensuring both scalability and stability. The hospital is wholly owned by Hopkins Healthcare Pvt.

Title: Tokenized assets in US near $20B as DTCC launches AppChain for real-time tokenized asset management

The DTCC's blockchain strategy aims to revolutionize collateral workflows by enabling real-time settlement and liquidity without sacrificing compliance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has launched a new tokenized real-time collateral management platform, signaling a major institutional commitment to decentralized finance infrastructure in the United States. The initiative is built as an AppChain and represents the first industry-wide use of a blockchain-native financial network to facilitate digital asset-backed collateral operations across markets. DTCC’s platform introduces a live digital collateral system that enables near real-time settlement and automated collateral operations via smart contracts. Built on LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain and supported by DTCC ComposerX, the system operates as part of the broader DTCC Digital Launchpad ecosystem introduced in October 2024. According to the organization, the platform will be publicly demonstrated on April 23 during “The Great Collateral Experiment,” a live showcase of cross-market use cases. The new approach aims to address long-standing inefficiencies in collateral workflows by streamlining asset movement across historically siloed infrastructure. As DTCC’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Nadine Chakar, stated, the model provides a more open, flexible, and institutionally viable framework than earlier digital collateral pilots. Chakar said, “We plan to continue building on this collateral model, engaging with the industry and our regulators to develop the standard for tokenized collateral across global jurisdictions.” CTO Dan Doney further emphasized that real-time collateral mobility represents a “killer app” for blockchain in traditional finance, potentially unlocking liquidity during volatile conditions without compromising operational integrity. DTCC processed $3 quadrillion in securities transactions in 2023 and holds custody of over $85 trillion in assets, making its endorsement a landmark moment in the broader adoption of tokenized systems. DTCC’s launch is emblematic of a broader movement across the US financial sector to integrate blockchain-based tokenization. The market for tokenized real-world assets surpassed $19 billion, up from $10 billion a year prior. Tokenized US Treasuries alone have reached $4.9 billion in value, and tokenized private credit now exceeds $12.4 billion. Parallel initiatives from financial giants, including BlackRock, JP Morgan, Apollo, and Franklin Templeton, reinforce the institutional shift. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund is approaching $2 billion in assets under management, while Apollo launched a tokenized private credit vehicle spanning six blockchain networks. The platform’s timing coincides with increased regulatory clarity in the US. The Lummis-Gillibrand Act and the Digital Commodity Exchange Act, both passed in 2024, provided clearer asset classification rules, granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary oversight of most digital assets. The rollback of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 has also reduced custody-related restrictions, making it easier for traditional institutions to hold tokenized assets without incurring balance sheet penalties. DTCC’s stated intent to engage with global regulators and define interoperable standards suggests a sustained effort to align technical innovation with evolving legal frameworks. Chakar noted that the group is working to establish the regulatory and legal architecture necessary for implementation, emphasizing cross-jurisdictional collaboration and direct engagement with the buy side. The AppChain-based structure of DTCC’s new collateral platform allows for private, secure asset movement while maintaining compliance and institutional control. Built atop Ethereum-compatible infrastructure, LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu network ensures scalability and data integrity. The platform’s open architecture and common standards are designed to support seamless integration with legacy systems and decentralized networks. This hybrid architecture reflects a growing trend between traditional and blockchain-native finance. Smart contract-based automation is increasingly being used to improve efficiency, transparency, and risk management in legacy financial systems. Pilot programs such as the Canton Network and CME Group’s use of Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger further validate blockchain’s potential as a foundational component of financial infrastructure. Collateral mobility has emerged as a key driver of institutional tokenization adoption. Tokenized systems enable assets to be reused, rehypothecated, and transferred across jurisdictions and platforms without traditional frictions or T+ settlement delays. By enhancing liquidity and capital efficiency, such systems offer compelling use cases for both buy- and sell-side participants.

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning If Wednesday was so-called Liberation Day in the United States, Thursday was tariff reaction day in Ireland and other parts of the European Union. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned of the possible hit to employment and tax revenues of an extended trade war at a briefing on first quarter exchequer returns, which at least showed a healthy rise in tax revenues for the State. Barry O’Halloran has the details. In our long read on the implications of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Cliff Taylor offers sharp insight into how the US, the EU and the Irish economies will react. Hugh Dooley, meanwhile, gathered reaction from a number of leading Irish food and drink exporters to the United States. Some see it as Brexit mark two, with others eyeing a pivot to different markets, and all of them still trying the process the full implications of Donald Trump’s moves. Larry Fink heads BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager. In an interview with Joe Brennan in Dublin, he said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months but added that Donald Trump’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. Tom Keogh makes the popular Keogh’s Crisps and the US accounts for 15 per cent of its volume. While tariffs are a threat to his Dublin business he is hopeful that the company can continue to offer its products at a competitive price while also pivoting towards other markets, including Canada. Hugh Dooley spoke to Tom Keogh. Our Interview of the Week is with Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith, who says the tech giant wouldn’t be the success that it is today “if we hadn’t forged this partnership with Ireland” some 40 years ago. He spoke with Ciara O’Brien on a recent visit to Dublin. In her weekly Work feature, Margaret E Ward explores whether conflict in the workplace can actually be good for innovation and results. Is Ireland really suffering a tourism collapse? Recent data from the Central Statistics Office suggests it has fallen off the proverbial cliff so far this year but some industry figures have been scratching their heads at the results. Jim Deegan is professor of tourism policy, director of the National Centre For Tourism Policy Studies and a member of the Economics Department at University of Limerick and offers a view on how we compile our figures for an industry that is hugely important to the economy. Almost 90 per cent of Irish businesses have suffered some form of financial loss and commercial disruption as a result of a cyberattack in the past five years, new research has found. Ciara O’Brien has the details. Stay up to date with all our business news: sign up to our Business Today daily email news digest.

Title: Fidelity crypto IRAs make their debut – All you need to know!

Will Fidelity flip BlackRock’s crypto dominance anytime soon? Fidelity Investments is making waves in the crypto space once again, expanding its digital asset offerings beyond Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). In a significant move, the brokerage firm has launched a crypto-focused Individual Retirement Account (IRA), allowing U.S. investors over 18 in eligible states to directly invest in Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Litecoin [LTC]. With this latest initiative, Fidelity will continue to bridge traditional finance with crypto, offering investors a new gateway into digital assets. Fidelity’s new crypto IRA product comes at a time when financial advisors are increasingly incorporating digital assets into their client portfolios. In fact, according to a recent survey by TMX Vetta Fi, 57% of advisors plan to expand their allocations to crypto ETFs, with a strong emphasis on crypto equity ETFs. That being said, Fidelity’s crypto IRA options offer investors a flexible path to secure their retirement. Custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets and stored in cold wallets, this IRA product comes with zero fees and supports Roth, traditional, and rollover IRA options. The Fidelity Crypto Roth IRA provides tax-free growth potential, while the Fidelity Crypto Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth. Additionally, the Fidelity Crypto Rollover IRA offers tax-deferred growth for those rolling over existing retirement accounts. This gives users a stress-free solution for integrating crypto into their long-term financial plans. Needless to say, Fidelity’s performance in the ETF market has been impressive, with its spot Bitcoin ETF, FBTC, recording $118.8 million in inflows. It even surpassed BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $115.9 million in outflows on 2 April. However, its spot Ethereum ETF is yet to attract any significant flows, according to Farside Investors. With Fidelity now expanding its crypto offerings, it even filed to list a Solana [SOL] ETF on the Cboe Exchange, signaling its growing commitment to the digital asset space. Additionally, reports suggest that Fidelity’s digital assets division is preparing tests for a potential stablecoin venture. However, no immediate plans for release have been announced yet. This strategic move positions Fidelity to remain a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. Especially as market dynamics continue to shift.
