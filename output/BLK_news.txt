We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) stands against other best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy right now. Global financial giants are increasingly turning their attention to the Middle East and are establishing operations in cities such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Riyadh. With attractive incentives such as low taxes, and robust regulatory frameworks, the region has become a magnet for investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, family offices, and law firms. Major players like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley have strengthened their presence across the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Asset management firms are also joining the trend. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has maintained a strong foothold in Saudi Arabia since opening its Riyadh office in 2019. Meanwhile, Wellington Management and Fiera Capital made their regional debuts in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively, underscoring the region’s growing appeal for global asset managers. These firms are drawn by opportunities in the Gulf’s booming financial sector and the region’s commitment to diversifying beyond oil revenues. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is set to remain the world’s top destination for wealthy individuals for the third consecutive year, with a projected net inflow of 6,700 millionaires by the end of 2024, according to the Henley Private Wealth Migration Report. This figure significantly surpasses the United States, which ranks second with an expected net inflow of 3,800 millionaires. The UAE’s appeal lies in its favorable tax policies, strategic geographic location, world-class infrastructure, and attractive long-term residency programs such as the “golden visa.” Africa is also an attractive place for investments, as demonstrated by the resounding success of the Africa Investment Forum 2024, which concluded on December 6 in Rabat, Morocco. The event secured an impressive $29.2 billion in new investor commitments after three days of intensive boardroom discussions. This year’s Forum witnessed a record attendance of 2,300 investors and delegates from 83 countries, marking a 60% increase from the previous year. Across 41 investment boardrooms, participants engaged in discussions spanning sectors such as transport, power, energy, agribusiness, industry, mining, pharmaceuticals, private equity, tourism, urban infrastructure, and water management. One standout success from the Forum was Nigeria’s Special Agro-Processing Zone project, which aimed to raise $975 million but secured $4.8 billion in investor interest. Similarly, projects from Morocco and the Democratic Republic of the Congo attracted investments surpassing initial targets. The Forum’s founding partners, including Africa50, Afreximbank, the Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Africa Finance Corporation, and the Islamic Development Bank, reaffirmed their dedication to strengthening collaboration and driving transformative investments across the continent. As global financial powerhouses continue to deepen their roots in the Middle East and investors increasingly turn their focus to Africa’s vast potential, both regions are emerging as pivotal hubs in the evolving global economic landscape. An open pit mine with heavy excavation machinery toiling away against the backdrop of a hidden valley. To compile our list of the 12 best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy right now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 30 largest companies in the Middle East and Africa. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 11 Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is a South African gold mining and exploration company. The company operates multiple mines in South Africa and Papua New Guinea and has established itself as a specialist gold producer with a growing international copper footprint. Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is focused on optimizing its existing operations, particularly its underground mines in South Africa. The company has allocated $117.18 million towards decline projects at these mines in FY25, which will enable it to maintain flexibility and reduce costs. Additionally, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is conducting studies to determine whether the life of the mine at its Hidden Valley can be extended further. The company is also progressing with a feasibility study update on its Wafi-Golpu copper project, which has the potential to become a significant contributor to the company’s future growth. Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is also exploring new opportunities to grow its business, including the development of its surface operations in South Africa. The company has identified significant potential in its old tailings dams, with 5.7 million ounces of resources in the Free State. A feasibility study is underway to determine the viability of re-mining these tailings, which could potentially create another mega tailings retreatment operation. Furthermore, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) is constantly looking for opportunities to acquire high-quality assets that can enhance the company’s portfolio and drive growth. Overall, HMY ranks 8th on our list of best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of HMY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HMY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is NIO Inc. (NIO) Among the Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025. A fleet of eco-friendly electric cars, a symbol of the company's commitment to sustainability. To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $4.36 5-Year Sales Growth: 49.65% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20 NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is another Chinese automotive company that focuses on developing premium smart electric vehicles. One of its standout features is its battery-swapping technology, which allows drivers to quickly exchange their depleted batteries for fully charged ones at designated stations. Moreover, in September 2024, the company introduced a mass-market brand called ONVO, which focuses on providing vehicles that also support battery swapping and various battery range options. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) set a new record with 61,855 vehicle deliveries, marking an increase of 11.6% year-over-year and a 7.8% increase from the previous quarter. The company maintained its status as the top-selling brand in China’s battery electric vehicle (BEV) segment for vehicles priced above RMB 300,000, capturing a 48% market share in that category. Moreover, its ONVO brand began delivering its first model, the L60, a midsize SUV that competes directly with popular models like the Tesla Model Y and Toyota RAV4. Its upcoming flagship model, the ET9, is in the final testing phase with deliveries expected to start in March 2025. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) plans to increase its monthly production capacity to 10,000 units by December 2024 and further to 20,000 units by March 2025, supporting its growth strategy as it prepares for new product launches. Overall, NIO ranks 3rd on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NIO to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Opinion: The climate agenda is in rapid retreat as right-wing parties rise everywhere
URL: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-climate-agenda-is-in-rapid-retreat-as-right-wing-parties-rise/

Environmental activists take part in a protest during the COP29 UN climate change conference, in Baku, Azerbaijan, on Nov. 22, 2024.Aziz Karimov/Reuters The last time Greta Thunberg posted a message on Twitter, now X, was on Nov. 27, and she did not mention climate, or global warming, or heating, though she did mention ecocide. It was about the oppression of the Kurds in Kurdistan. Ms. Thunberg, with 5.3 million X followers, became the public face of youth-led climate activism when she was in her mid-teens – she is now 21 – and appears to have taken her foot off the climate gas pedal in recent months. She is not alone. Governments everywhere seem burnt out on climate change, even as temperatures continue to set records and climate emergencies abound (the global average temperature reached an all-time high last July 22). Ditto investors and average citizens. Climate last year fell off global political and fiscal agendas and may not reappear any time soon. Take the annual United Nations-sponsored climate conferences. Can anyone remember what was accomplished, if anything, at November’s COP29 (Conference of the Parties) in Azerbaijan? Or any of the previous ones? COP21 in Paris in 2015 was the last climate summit that made global headlines, that made a genuine breakthrough and finished on an optimistic note. The Paris Agreement, which applied to all countries, sought to limit the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 C over preindustrial levels. Ditto the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, also last November. Climate change was barely mentioned at the event even though the collection of the richest countries, which includes coal-mad China, collectively spew out some 80 per cent of global greenhouse gases, and their emissions are rising. Since the first COP in 1995, emissions are up by more than a third. There is no high-profile credible voice any more to warn about the existential threats of relentless global warming. Al Gore, a former U.S. vice-president who was co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his climate activism, was the last heavyweight on the global climate stage. Powerful money managers such as BlackRock and State Street are rolling back their ESG – environmental, social and governance – fund offerings while their bosses rarely utter the term “ESG” any more. Why is this happening even as the 1.5-degree goal appears to be wishful thinking and 2-degree warming seems inevitable? The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service last summer said that global average temperatures reached or exceeded 1.5 C above preindustrial levels every month between July, 2023, and last June. At 2 degrees, scientists have warned that coral reefs will disappear, ice-free Arctic summers will become common, ocean levels will rise by more than half a metre (which would flood coastal cities) and storms, heat waves and droughts will become extreme, putting hundreds of millions of people – or more – in danger of chronic water scarcity and potentially making parts of the planet uninhabitable. The rise of the right-wing parties certainly is propelling the climate retreat. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is embracing a “drill, baby, drill” agenda and has promised to terminate what he called President Joe Biden’s Green New Deal once Mr. Trump enters the White House later this month. During his first term as president, he pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement and killed or diluted a dollop of climate regulations. His pick for energy secretary, oil industry executive Chris Wright, said last year, “There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.” The story is similar elsewhere. In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called the European Union’s 2035 target to end the sale of internal combustion engine cars “self-destructive” because it would hand the death sentence to the traditional European auto industry, with almost 14 million employees, according to EU data. In Argentina, President Javier Milei, an admirer of Mr. Trump who is often referred to as a right-wing libertarian, has called climate change a “socialist lie.” He downgraded the environment ministry, boycotted COP29 and is pursuing a pro-mining and pro-drilling campaign. In Germany, conservative Opposition leader Friedrich Merz, who is on course to win a February snap election, has pledged to downgrade Germany’s ambitious climate policies. Green parties have lost ground in European elections. The era that saw millions of protesters take to the streets to demand action to fight climate change seems over. Sales of electric vehicles are slowing. Yet climate hypocrisy is alive and well in Europe. For instance, some of the same politicians who support the demise of gasoline and diesel cars also favour punishing tariffs on cheap imported Chinese EVs. The EU does make EVs, but most models are unaffordable to average families. Without inexpensive EVs, the EU’s net-zero goals will be hard to meet. The rise of the right means that the climate agenda will almost certainly stay in reverse – all the more so if voters in the West decide that tight emission controls will only transfer manufacturing jobs to China. As far as most Westerners are concerned, climate disasters happen to someone else. Only when the pain and misery come close to home will the picture change. In recent history, it was extreme and deadly emergencies that triggered quick corrective action. The COVID-19 pandemic saw vaccines produced in record time, for example. With the planet warming rapidly, the climate emergency is bound to come soon, as Ms. Thunberg had warned.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs raked in $908 million in net inflows on Friday, rebounding from Thursday’s $242 million outflow, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) netted $253 million, ending a three-day negative streak that saw $392 million in losses. The fund’s total net inflows recovered to $37 million, with holdings of 548,506 Bitcoin valued at $53.4 billion. Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led Friday’s gains with $357 million in net inflows—one of its strongest daily performances since launch. FBTC has accumulated over $12 billion in new investments as of January 3. The ARKB fund, managed by ARK Invest and 21Shares, recorded $222 million in net inflows. Bitwise, Grayscale (BTC), and VanEck funds also posted gains, while other ETF providers reported no flows. Bitcoin reached $98,900 on Friday, surpassing $98,000 for the first time since December 26, CoinGecko data shows. The digital asset currently trades above $98,000, showing a 4% increase over the past week. Analysts predict a bullish year for Bitcoin, driven by growing institutional and national adoption. Galaxy Research forecasts five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nations will add Bitcoin to their balance sheets in 2025 to diversify their portfolio and meet their trade settlement needs. The firm also projects US spot Bitcoin ETFs will reach $250 billion in assets under management. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, recommends that investors increase their holdings in Bitcoin and gold through 2025, as these assets offer valuable protection against inflation, fiscal uncertainty, and global de-dollarization trends. Van Eck projects Bitcoin could reach $150,000 to $170,000. This stance is supported by other financial analysts and institutions recognizing Bitcoin’s potential to hedge against financial risks.

The Bible resonates across the ages, always having something to say to us no matter what may have changed in the world as a whole. It’s as true in 2025 as it ever has been. So, we’ll contemplate the events of the past year or so through the lens of this passage from Matthew: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” We begin with that human colossus overshadowing the entire globe: Donald Trump. We all know the story, even as it transmutes into legend, something that will be told, retold, analyzed, disparaged, and rekindled for generations to come. Even as he reached out to his opposition, Trump, during his first term, was interfered with to an extent never before witnessed in a presidential administration. Taking advice from Chris Christie, of all people, keeping on Christopher Wray and Mark Milley, hiring establishment backstabbers like William Barr—it gained him nothing. He was assailed, undercut, and betrayed on all sides—and yet he still succeeded in fulfilling much of his agenda. They cheated him out of his rightfully earned second term in 2020, secure in the knowledge that nobody would ever figure it out. Then came the impeachments—two of them one after the other, as if they were aware, deep down, that one couldn’t possibly work.

The American Left, the media, and the Deep State blew it as completely as anyone has ever blown anything.

The July coup, the Harris time-bomb, the Walz selection, the attempt to run an aging call girl as a racial messiah… all of it wasted effort, all of it leading to the inevitable conclusion. All the while, Trump campaigned like a man possessed, running a schedule that would have broken most men half his age. Sitting before corrupt, vindictive Democrat judges in the morning, then hopping a plane to host a rally in the afternoon—and doing it over and over again, day after day, week after week. Nothing slowed him down, not even an assassin’s bullet. This is the class of event that we’re too close to for proper judgment. It was years after Midway before anybody grasped what that victory meant. It was a decade after Apollo XI before we began to understand what had been thrown away. The same is true here. We may not live long enough to see the final outcome of what transpired this year. The Dems, needless to say, will never get it, which is as it should be. We turn now to Ukraine. The bully-worshippers who bow down to a KGB agent who uses nerve gas and radioisotopes against his critics should probably sit this one out. Ukraine is a fragment of a former empire that has spent decades trying to find its feet—and failing. In the strictest sense, Putin wasn’t wrong. No sane military analysis would see Ukraine as anything but a basket case state that was just aching to be snatched up by the first comer. Putin didn’t even call it a “war.” No—it was a “special military operation.” It would take about three days. It’s clear that Putin was thinking in terms of Crete, 1941. There, the German Luftwaffe flew in Ju-52 transports packed with troops to Maleme airfield, many of them actually crash-landing on the runway. These took control of the field thanks to a British commander who pulled his troops out to “regroup” them (have to make sure those boots are properly shined, pip-pip). Within hours, the Germans had landed thousands of troops, and the Brits were finished. Putin tried the same thing, sending in a large transport stuffed with Spetnaz special forces to take over Kyiv’s airport. But that plane was shot down, killing hundreds of Russia’s finest troops. The rest of the Ilyushins never showed up. The tank columns were caught in an unseasonable Rasputitsa, and here we are, going on three years later. As classic an example of asymmetric warfare as you are likely to find. The Ukrainians, out of necessity, revolutionized warfare with the use of cheap drones to negate much more advanced and expensive weapons. Putin’s military was exposed as essentially a massive hoax, his “18,000 tanks in storage” suddenly turning into piles of rust and broken parts. He lost most of his Black Sea fleet to a country without a Navy. Putin was, in the end, forced to turn to Russia’s traditional “strategy” (to stretch the term to its utmost limits): wasting troops by the thousands to gain a few hundred yards of ground. Even if Ukraine were to surrender today, it would still be a Russian failure. Putin has succeeded in awakening a somnolent NATO, encouraging much greater spending on armaments, wrecking the ruble, destroying Russia’s credit, ramming the BRICs alliance onto the rocks, and not least, losing something on the order of 750,000 men. As for the putative reason for the war in the first place—to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO—both Sweden and Finland have joined the alliance after generations (centuries, in Sweden’s case)—of neutrality. So now Putin has one of the most technologically adept and the most ferocious peoples in Europe lined up against him. Well done, Vlad. Now, if they could only learn to keep their hands out of the till. We turn to Israel. A little over a year ago, Israel was mired in one of the worst situations of its short lifetime. Iran’s long-term plans were coming to fruition. Israel was surrounded by enemies, including the effective and well-armed terror groups, Hamas and Hezb’allah. Russia had established military bases less than an hour’s flight from Israel’s borders. The Houthis, armed by Iran, were prepared to cut off the Red Sea. Israeli-Arab conciliation through the Abraham Accords, mediated by Donald Trump, lay in a state of limbo. Iran was drawing ever closer to unveiling a working nuclear weapon. Anti-Semitism was surging worldwide, triggered by Western-based Islamist groups and encouraged by the likes of Barry Obama, Jimmy Carter, Roger Waters, and the Congressional Squad. The Biden administration had blatantly and openly betrayed the Jewish state on all possible levels. And today? Well…if the Jews aren’t actually God’s chosen people, they’ll do until one comes along. It can be safely said that the situation has not been so much reversed as turned inside out and then run through a Klein bottle. Hamas has been constricted to one single neighborhood, where it is relentlessly being attritted. Hezb’allah has been decapitated in one of the most brilliant covert espionage operations on record. Iran’s air defenses have been shattered, and it now awaits the inevitable crushing of its nuclear sites. Syria has collapsed, with much of its military weaponry and supplies destroyed by Israel and the U.S., while the Russian naval task forces based there have taken to their heels. So the first have become last. Trump was supposed to act as an object lesson to any who would defy the Dem/Soros/BlackRock leviathan. Ukraine was supposed to vanish like the morning dew. Israel was to be subject to the Second Holocaust while the world shook its head and sighed. The last have become first. We stand on the verge of a new age with infinite promise and wrenching terrors that may, in fact, lead to those “broad, sunlit uplands” that we were promised so many years ago. The key now is to keep it going. We need to study how all this was done in order to ensure it continues being done. (Two suggestions: Curtail the “Reach across the aisle” types infesting the GOP—farewell, Mitt—and cease to respond to media efforts at promoting hysteria like the drone hoax and the H-1B tantrums. I’ve always understood MAGA to be comprised of adults. Let’s start acting like it.) Above all, we need to learn how to keep our chin up, how not to lose faith, how to take a bullet and come up fighting, and how to come out on top when all seems lost. And at last, because it is apt, because it is righteous, because it is true, we will end with another quote from the book on which our civilization is based: “The race does not always go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but time and chance happeneth to them all.” This essay was originally published in our subscriber-only e-newsletter, a weekly compilation of original essays from American Thinker editors.

The Bible resonates across the ages, always having something to say to us no matter what may have changed in the world as a whole. It’s as true in 2025 as it ever has been. So, we’ll contemplate the events of the past year or so through the lens of this passage from Matthew: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” We begin with that human colossus overshadowing the entire globe: Donald Trump. We all know the story, even as it transmutes into legend, something that will be told, retold, analyzed, disparaged, and rekindled for generations to come. Even as he reached out to his opposition, Trump, during his first term, was interfered with to an extent never before witnessed in a presidential administration. Taking advice from Chris Christie, of all people, keeping on Christopher Wray and Mark Milley, hiring establishment backstabbers like William Barr—it gained him nothing. He was assailed, undercut, and betrayed on all sides—and yet he still succeeded in fulfilling much of his agenda. They cheated him out of his rightfully earned second term in 2020, secure in the knowledge that nobody would ever figure it out. Then came the impeachments—two of them one after the other, as if they were aware, deep down, that one couldn’t possibly work. Followed by a slew of bogus lawsuits that should even now result in disbarments and unbenchings across the country. Image by AI. They assured themselves that they’d buried the boogieman deep at the crossroads. They were mistaken. All the same, they must have been delighted when he ran again in ‘24, meaning that the GOP had nobody capable of taking his place (no surprise there). They’d beaten him once. They had humiliated and disgraced him, tarnished his name, and threatened his family. They could do it again. That worked out well.

Title: Morgan Stanley Joins U.S. Bank Exodus from Climate Coalition

Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info A slew of US banks have exited a climate coalition in the days leading up to Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Yesterday evening, Morgan Stanley became the latest US bank to depart from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, as pressure increasingly mounted on financial institutions from Republican lawmakers. Despite leaving the alliance, Morgan Stanley said in a statement that the bank’s commitment to meeting its carbon targets “remains unchanged”. Citigroup and Bank of America also left the group earlier this week, while Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs departed earlier in December. The UN-backed alliance, which includes over 140 banks with more than $70 trillion (£56.5 trillion) in assets, was founded in 2021 with the goal of bringing the financial sector into alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. It is an initiative of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, co-chaired by Michael Bloomberg and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Other voluntary industry climate alliances, including the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the now-disbanded Net Zero Insurance Alliance, and the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative have similarly seen exits from major industry players in recent years. A large reason for the departure of many financial institutions from institutions like this has been pressure from right-wing lawmakers in the US to try and push banks away from sustainable investing. The issue has been a thorn in the side of giant US asset managers such as Blackrock, who have faced condemnation and attacks from Republican politicians. Last year, Blackrock was sued by the attorney general of Tennessee over its ESG policies, while it has been dropped from the public pension funds of multiple US states due to its support of sustainable investing. In November, Scottish asset manager Baillie Gifford left both the Climate Action 100+ group and Net Zero Asset Managers initiative after it became embroiled in a months-long scandal over its sponsorship of literary festivals. “Our membership has become contested, and this risks distracting from our core responsibilities,” a Baillie Gifford spokesperson told City AM at the time. Despite fears that the departures may lead to a watering down of climate pledges, analysts explained that as regulatory burdens have grown on financial institutions to hire those with sustainability credentials, the need to be part of these groups has become less necessary.

Title: Risk Appetites Dim in Week of New Year’s Angst on Wall Street

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- The turning of the calendar is an occasion to look ahead. For Wall Street at New Year’s, the verdict on the future is one of trepidation. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYC Congestion Pricing to Take Effect After Years of Delays NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue Burned-Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces Detroit’s Michigan Central Is the Building Revival Story of 2024 While spirits perked up on Friday, traders across asset classes spent much of the post-holiday period reining in the robust risk appetites that have ruled markets for much of 2024. Volatility measures crept up in Treasuries and corporate credit. They jumped in stocks, which posted the worst end-of-year slump on record. The largest exchange-traded fund tracking Bitcoin, darling of speculators globally, saw its worst-ever outflows. Nothing in markets implied panic. But the moves did signal a wariness that has been largely absent in the past 12 months, at least in risk assets where a booming economy and easing Federal Reserve policy have been a recipe for nearly straight-up gains. Concern about Donald Trump’s presidential policies and their impact on inflation awoke hedging markets and kept bonds unsettled after the biggest quarterly runup in 10-year Treasury yields in more than two years. To contrarians who have watched months of rampant risk-taking on Wall Street, any newfound caution is seen as healthy — a brake on overheating. Still, the pullback in certain assets, equities in particular, defied a historic pattern where the S&P 500 has tended to rise in the sessions right after Christmas, highlighting the hazards of preset playbooks in the second Trump era. “We were a little surprised to see the market so risk-off at the end of 2024, but it is possible that the market was getting a slight jump on 2025,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management. “It makes sense to us to take some risk off the table given the incoming administration is likely to make policy changes.” Ten-year Treasury yields held above the widely watched 4.5% level as traders braced for tariffs that could come as early as this month after Trump’s inauguration, adding fresh risk to the Fed’s inflation-fighting campaign. Bond vigilantes have also been sounding alarms that Trump’s tax-cut agenda threatens to widen the fiscal deficit. Signs of bullishness resurfaced on Friday, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% as megacap tech stocks rallied and investors took relief from a swift re-election of the US House speaker. For the week, equities retreated, hovering near a low reached after the Fed’s last policy meeting, when central bankers signaled fewer interest rate reductions for this year than previously forecast. The specter of policy uncertainty has put investors on edge, with demand for protection rising across assets. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of the cost of S&P 500 options, climbed for a third week in four. A similar measure for Treasuries, the ICE BofA Move Index, hit a one-month high while turbulence ticked up in high-yield bonds and currencies. The low-level gloom is a departure from recent months, when raging gambling spirits sent Bitcoin above $100,000 and drove billions of dollars to leveraged ETFs. Now, BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is seeing its longest streak of outflows, including a record withdrawal on Thursday, while short sellers are reloading wagers against some of the largest ETFs tracking corporate debt. In equities, an indicator of exposure kept by the National Association of Active Investment Managers slipped for a third straight week, marking the biggest drop since April. Meanwhile, a Cboe measure of options trading showed that volume in bearish puts spiked to the highest level in almost four months relative to bullish calls. The risk aversion, for now, is at odds with optimism among Wall Street strategists in a Bloomberg survey, whose consensus calls for another 12% gain in 2025 after the S&P 500 scored a two-year, 53% rally. “The dominant market view is that equities will continue climbing a wall of worry, but we know the incoming US administration loves building tall walls. In other words, the obstacles to keep delivering gains will get bigger,” said Max Gokhman, senior vice president at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. “So while I’m not going out of consensus to be bearish, it’s prudent to be careful and ready to tactically return to the sidelines.” Higher anxiety levels are visible across markets. Bank of America Corp.’s Global Financial Stress indicator — which measures market risk, hedging demand and investor flows — sat above where it was 12 months ago. Part of the uneasiness reflects lingering concern over market valuations, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. A Bloomberg model that adjusts the S&P 500 earnings yield and 10-year Treasury rates for inflation shows pricing for the world’s two most-watched assets is historically stretched. In fact, current cross-asset valuations, in real terms, are higher than 88% of the time in data going back to 1962. “A modicum of caution at these tight valuations make sense but the growth story still feels intact,” Rosner said.

Title: VanEck CEO recommends investors to double down on Bitcoin as hedge in 2025

As gold and Bitcoin register a bull market, Jan van Eck stated that these assets are essential for any portfolio. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck, has recommended that investors maintain or increase their exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and gold in 2025 in the firm’s 2025 outlook report. He argued that these assets are indispensable hedges against inflationary pressures, fiscal uncertainty, and global de-dollarization trends. According to van Eck, gold and Bitcoin have proven to be resilient stores of value amidst global economic turbulence. He added: “Bull markets in gold and Bitcoin are supported by inflationary pressures, fiscal uncertainty, and de-dollarization trends.” Consequently, he emphasized that these assets are essential for any portfolio seeking to guard against inflation. Robust foreign central bank purchases and a growing shift away from reliance on the US dollar in global trade drive gold’s current bull market. This de-dollarization trend has amplified the demand for gold as a stable and reliable asset. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently surged past the $100,000 mark, continuing its bull cycle following the halving event in the second quarter of 2024. Van Eck projects BTC could reach $150,000 to $170,000 during this cycle, driven by its increasing adoption as a “store of value” asset. Additionally, based on historical patterns from prior halving events, Bitcoin is in the midst of a three-year bull market, which positions it as a pivotal asset for long-term wealth preservation. While van Eck acknowledges the potential for volatility, particularly in gold, he remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for both assets. As a result, even amid price corrections, the fundamentals of BTC and gold will remain strong. Notably, van Eck’s vision aligns with other analysts. In October, Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, highlighted that BTC is a hedge for systemic financial risks, although not a solid alternative for geopolitical tensions. In a nine-page letter published in September, BlackRock told its investors that Bitcoin is resilient to “black swan” macro events, such as banking system crises, sovereign debt crises, currency debasement, and geopolitical disruption. The document also highlighted that Bitcoin could be used to hedge against possible US dollar instability stemming from federal debt and deficit fears, which would further improve the attractiveness of alternative assets.

Title: Bitcoin – How USD’s strength, low stablecoin supply could dictate price action

Time Published: 2025-01-03T20:00:37Z

A stronger dollar tends to weaken the demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 in mid-December. Since then, the king coin has struggled to regain its momentum on the charts. At press time, BTC was trading at $96,789 following gains of 1.5% in 24 hours, with the crypto still just over 10% shy of its ATH. While Bitcoin could stage a recovery later this month thanks to Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S President, two key factors could continue to weigh on the price. The U.S dollar index (DXY), which measures the performance of the U.S dollar against major currencies, has surged to 109 – its highest level since November 2022. What this hike indicates is that the U.S dollar has been gaining strength lately. (Source: MarketWatch) The DXY is inversely correlated with Bitcoin’s price, meaning that a hike limits the coin’s upside potential. Additionally, a stronger dollar tends to weaken the demand for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. In fact, the fall in demand is already evident in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. On the first day of trading in 2025, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded $332M in outflows, marking its highest outflows in history. The total outflows from all 11 Bitcoin ETFs hit $242M, as per SoSoValue. If these outflows persist, it could fuel a surge in sell-side pressure. This will, in turn, fuel a downtrend for BTC on the charts. The weakened demand seemed not only evident among institutional investors, but also in the retail market. For instance – According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) surged to 17 – Its highest level in seven days. (Source: CryptoQuant) A higher ratio means that the supply of stablecoins is low, compared to BTC’s market cap. This results in low buying pressure that could exert downward pressure on the price. Despite market factors pointing to reducing demand and buying pressure, the Fear and Greed Index, which measures the market sentiment, revealed that traders are still bullish. This index had a value of 74 at press time, suggesting that most traders are optimistic about BTC’s price movement. Since the index climbed from 65 earlier this week, it could be good news for BTC if traders start buying. However, if the buy-side pressure is not enough to absorb the sold coins, it could limit the gains on the charts.

Title: 2024: The Year Crypto Silenced Its Critics? The Numbers Tell All
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/03/2024-the-year-crypto-silenced-its-critics-the-numbers-tell-all/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T19:30:51Z
Full Content:
The chart tracks the frequency of “Bitcoin obituaries” - articles declaring Bitcoin’s demise - from ... [+] 2010 to 2024. The number of such articles peaked dramatically in 2017 with 124 publications, coinciding with Bitcoin’s first major price surge. Since then, obituaries have steadily declined, reaching just 2 articles in 2024 despite Bitcoin crossing $100,000. This reduction in negative predictions, from the 2017 peak to present day, suggests a notable shift in how the cryptocurrency is perceived by commentators and institutions. After Donald Trump’s election in 2024, an unexpected moment of candor emerged from an unlikely source. On their long-running Crypto Critics' Corner podcast, Cas Piancey and Bennett Tomlin—two of cryptocurrency's most well informed skeptics—made a striking admission. After years of investigating and criticizing Tether and the broader crypto ecosystem, they conceded that their long-predicted regulatory crackdown was unlikely to materialize. In their words “They win, we lose”. This moment of capitulation from prominent critics wasn't an isolated incident. At 99Bitcoins, a website that has diligently tracked Bitcoin's "death" pronouncements since 2010, the editors found themselves with surprisingly little to do in 2024. Their "Bitcoin obituaries" counter, which records major declarations of Bitcoin's demise by media and notable figures, recorded just two such pronouncements all year: the lowest number since 2012. The pattern is striking. Bitcoin obituaries peaked in 2017 with 124 declarations of its death, coinciding with its first major price surge. Another surge appeared in 2021-2022 during Bitcoin's second major bull run and the subsequent FTX collapse. But 2024's mere two obituaries mark a shift in perception. The Bitcoin ETF approval has a lot to do with this. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in March 2024 didn't just mark a regulatory milestone, it unleashed an unprecedented wave of institutional adoption. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, in particular, shattered every previous ETF launch record. Reaching $10 billion in assets under management in just seven weeks, it accomplished what took the previous record-holder, SPDR Gold Shares, two years to achieve. By the end of 2024, the iShares Bitcoin Trust had accumulated over $50 billion in assets under management—a stunning achievement in just 11 months. The first day of trading alone saw volumes exceeding $4.65 billion, signalling massive pent-up demand from both institutional and retail investors. With total net assets over $106 billion, these Bitcoin ETFs aren't just successful: they're approaching the scale of gold ETFs that have been established for decades. This isn't merely adoption; it's a wholesale transformation of how traditional finance views and accesses cryptocurrency. Larry Fink's evolution from crypto skeptic to champion perfectly embodies this transformation. The BlackRock CEO's journey from dismissing Bitcoin as a money laundering tool to overseeing one of the most successful ETF launches in financial history represents the broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. The transformation in the political sphere has been equally dramatic. Donald Trump, once a cryptocurrency skeptic who described Bitcoin as "a scam against the dollar" in 2021, has emerged as a powerful voice in the crypto space. His appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference marked a key moment in cryptocurrency's global political legitimacy. The selection of JD Vance, a well-known crypto advocate, as his vice presidential candidate further signalled cryptocurrency's emergence as a serious policy consideration. Perhaps most significantly, the conversation in Washington has evolved from regulatory skepticism to strategic opportunity. The discussion of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. Senate - unthinkable just a few years ago - represents a fundamental shift in how government officials view cryptocurrency's role in the national economy. This isn't just about accepting crypto's existence; it's about potentially integrating it into national financial strategy. This acceptance isn't limited to Bitcoin. Stablecoins, backed by major financial institutions and payment processors like Stripe, are processing transaction volumes comparable to traditional payment networks like Visa. This represents a fundamental innovation in payment technology that's becoming impossible to ignore. The steep decline in Bitcoin obituaries in 2024 isn't just a statistical curiosity. It's a marker of cryptocurrency's transition from a speculative phenomenon to an established part of the financial landscape. The question is no longer whether crypto will survive, but how it will evolve and integrate with traditional financial systems. The editors at 99Bitcoins might find themselves even less busy in the years to come, but they've documented something remarkable: the year when cryptocurrency's critics had to accept that crypto is here to stay.

Title: Top Expert Sees 'Healthy Pause' for Bitcoin ETF Growth

U.Today - The start of 2025 brought an unexpected twist for BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as investors pulled out a whopping $332.6 million in just one day, which is equal to 3,413 BTC. This is the biggest withdrawal from the ETF since it launched, bigger than the $188.7 million anti record, which happened in the last decade of December. A top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg reacted to the historical anti record with a more "glass half full" approach, claiming that these pullbacks are to be expected and are long overdue. He also said that Bitcoin ETFs probably won't keep growing so fast, and while the amount of money that left might have caught some by surprise, it's just a sign that things are shifting. It's like taking a breather on a journey where you have been moving forward consistently, from an expert's point of view. The timing of these outflows lines up with a developing story in Bitcoin's price dynamics. There is a pattern on the charts that looks like a "head-and-shoulders" shape, and if it breaks below the $92,000 neckline, it could take the price to as low as $70,000 per BTC. The details still tell a different story as IBIT ended 2024 on a strong note, pulling in over $37 billion in inflows over the year. Its Ethereum equivalent, ETHA, also got a lot of attention, raking in $3.53 billion. These ETFs helped solidify BlackRock's spot as a major player in institutional crypto investment, with Bitcoin holdings worth about $53 billion and Ethereum at almost $3.7 billion. But even the best of these funds can be affected by market cycles. This article was originally published on U.Today

As the co-founder and general partner at early stage venture capital fund Race Capital, Edith Yeung has had a front-row seat on the development of the crypto sector, particularly in Hong Kong, where she was born and raised. Most notably, she was a seed investor in Solana, investing $250,000 when SOL was valued at just $0.04, and also was an early investor in Lightning Network. Since 2017, Yeung has also authored the China Internet report, an influential annual survey of technology trends in China. Here, Yeung, who will be a speaker at Consensus Hong Kong, discusses Hong Kong’s ongoing development as a crypto hub, her take on China’s stance towards crypto, what she foresees for Solana and one big crypto prediction for 2025. This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong. Come and experience the most influential event in Web3 and Digital Assets, Feb.18-20. Register today and save 15% with the code CoinDesk15. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. How do you see crypto regulations developing in HK in 2025? Do you think more crypto companies will become licensed by the SFC in 2025? It’s exciting to see that Hong Kong now has seven SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platforms. From an investor’s perspective, having a clear licensing regime is a major step forward. Regulatory clarity and predictability are like well-lit roads — they give investors the confidence to drive forward without worrying about unexpected detours. That said, licensing alone isn’t enough. Liquidity is the other critical piece of the puzzle. Think of a trading platform like a brand-new highway: you can have the smoothest pavement and clearest signs, but if no cars are on it, drivers won’t bother. Similarly, no matter how many licenses you have, if there’s no active trading and liquidity, investors will hesitate to come aboard. The key for Hong Kong now is to build not just the infrastructure but the traffic flow — because a great platform without liquidity is like an empty highway going nowhere. What kind of role do you see Hong Kong developing in terms of the crypto sector, especially in relation to the US? What about Asia more broadly? Hong Kong is the New York of Asia. Exchange Square is basically Wall Street — a 24/7 financial powerhouse with soaring skyscrapers and streets full of traders, investors and bankers with energy that never quits. If you are a crypto builder or investor, you will find many TradFi talents (traders, market makers, etc.) in Hong Kong. To build a successful TradFi or DeFi company, you need to recruit specific types of talent that are hard to find even in Silicon Valley. Hong Kong boasts a rich financial history, with its stock market origins dating back to 1866 — over 150 years — means there is a deep pool of experienced professionals who can drive innovation and growth in your venture. What would you say is distinctive about HK/Southeast Asia for crypto compared to the US and Europe? The U.S. is home to the largest crypto addressable market in terms of institutional investors, regulators and builders. But Asia is home to the highest growth potential for the crypto market. In 2024, half of the top 10 countries in the world ranked by crypto adoption were located in Asia. With the new Trump administration, the U.S. will continue to set the tone for crypto regulation and institutional adoption (e.g., BlackRock ETF). Asia will follow their lead with its massive usage base that is young and crypto-native. Do you view China as generally pro or anti-crypto? There’s been a lot of crypto activity there, but at the same time, the government is officially against mining and speculation. Hong Kong is part of China. Seeing pro-crypto regulation slowly forming in Hong Kong is a great sign and indicator for China. That said, China literally has an army of 220 million retail investors sitting on almost $21 trillion worth of savings. With a lingering property crisis and a meek economy, however, it is very difficult to say when China will open up for crypto business again, as the government focuses on these larger issues. You were a seed investor in Solana; do you still have your initial investment there? Do you think Solana will continue to attract as much memecoin activity as it did in 2024? Yes. It was an honor that I got to meet Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal and become their seed investor back in March 2018. I am a long-term Solana holder and supporter. What I love about them is their dedication to building and their support for the developer community. The developer energy at the 2024 Breakpoint conference was high not only because of memecoins. The Firedancer team made huge technical advances last year, and I just love that Anatoly is still head-down geeking out with people like Jump Trading chief science officer Kevin Bowers and his team every day. Even more exciting to me is seeing traditional finance players like Fidelity, Citi and PayPal speaking at Breakpoint about what they are building on Solana. This influx of established players not only validates Solana's future but also signals that blockchain technology is ready for the masses. What kinds of companies are you currently looking to invest in and why? I am a seed investor in Huma Finance — a leader in PayFi building on Solana and a leader in stablecoin infrastructure. In 2024, they did over $2 billion in stablecoin transactions. At Race Capital, we will continue to focus on investing in internet infrastructure. Builders who want to be around long-term do not mind whether it’s an up or down cycle. What’s something you think will happen in 2025 that will surprise crypto folks? The establishment of a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve by the end of 2025. The United States is currently the largest holder of Bitcoin, with approximately 207,189 bitcoins. This effort will be bolstered by this massive stockpile, which is now valued at over $20 billion at current prices. This decision is expected to drive up bitcoin prices, prompting other governments around the world to follow suit. What are you most excited to discuss onstage in Hong Kong? Hong Kong’s role in building the crypto industry in 2025, China's love/hate relationship with crypto and perhaps more insights on Solana.

Title: ByteDance and Trump’s Perplexing TikTok Pirouette
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/01/03/bytedance-and-trumps-perplexing-tiktok-pirouette/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T17:00:00Z

A looming existential crisis confronts TikTok. Come January 19th, a divestiture deadline will kick in unless the Supreme Court intervenes. (Either ByteDance, TikTok’s Beijing-based parent, sells the social media platform with over 1 billion monthly users, or it will be prohibited from operating in the United States.) Nine days earlier, on January 10th, the high court will hear two hours of argument on the platform’s fate. If TikTok loses, app stores like Apple, Google, and others will be barred from offering TikTok to new users—for all intents and purposes, a technological death sentence. This dictum, enacted into law in April, stems from an informed fear that the Chinese Communist Party would use TikTok to access personal data and surveil Americans. “Communications applications that are owned and operated by companies controlled by foreign adversary countries present a clear threat to the national security of the United States,” in the words of a House committee. The TikTok saga showcases tensions within the GOP. First broached by President Donald Trump in a 2020 executive order, the doomsday scenario reappeared last spring. On the other hand, Trump is now boosting TikTok, opposing the ban he once championed. He even credits the app for playing a role in his political resurrection. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok because I won youth by 34 points,” he said at a December 16th press conference. “And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.” To top it off, he hosted Shou Chew, CEO of TikTok, at Mar-a-Lago that same day. For the record, Trump failed to win the under-30 vote in November, but he did make a strong showing. Regardless, his 2020 executive order painted a bullseye on the app. “The spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People’s Republic of China (China) continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,” he declared back then. “Action must be taken to address the threat posed by one mobile application in meticulous, TikTok.” During the 2024 Republican presidential primaries, Nikki Haley—former South Carolina governor and Trump’s first-term U.N. ambassador—saw even more menace in TikTok. Against the backdrop of Hamas’ attack on Israel and campus unrest, she argued that the ubiquitous app purveyed antisemitism. The strictures aimed at TikTok eventually re-emerged as part of a broader aid package to Israel and Ukraine. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, as it came to be known, also branded China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as “foreign adversaries”—in case anyone needed reminding. A ton of money is at stake. Goldman Sachs estimates that the app-driven, “creator economy could approach half-a-trillion dollars by 2027.” TikTok is a large but not exclusive part of that. With an American base of 170 million users and creators, it does not intend to lose them. Enter Jeff Yass, co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, a trading company. Its 15 percent stake in ByteDance is valued at about $26 billion. As fate would have it, Susquehanna was also the largest institutional investor in Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, aka Truth Social, in late March. (For the record, Susquehanna and other U.S. investment firms, including BlackRock, General Atlantic, and others own 60 percent of ByteDance). Does this explain Trump’s pirouette on ByteDance? The plot thickens. In March, Trump met with Yass and jettisoned his prior hostility to Chinese ownership of the platform. “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” Trump posted to Truth Social. The competitor of my adversary is my friend, so to speak. “I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better,” he added. “They are a true Enemy of the People!” On X, Elon Musk trumpeted the sentiment: “Trump’s statement there is correct.” With a significant presence in China, Musk may be loath to offend Xi and the country’s other leaders, regardless of whether TikTok is a competitor to his X platform. By late spring, TikTok and ByteDance commenced a legal challenge to the ban, arguing that the legislative attack failed constitutional muster. Amicus briefs transcended the usual liberal-conservative and left-right divides. To illustrate, Zephyr Teachout, a Bernie Sanders backer and former challenger to Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York, who has written for this magazine, joined a friends-of-court brief backing the government filed by Mark Meador, a former aide to Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican, and a one-time fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Matt Stoller, a former staffer to Sanders on the Senate budget committee and an antitrust advocate, was also aboard. Likewise, a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress backed the law. Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State; Elise Stefanik, Trump’s choice for U.N. ambassador; and Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, supported it, along with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Ritchie Torres, and Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic senator-elect from Michigan. On the other half of the divide, the libertarian Cato Institute (a beneficiary of Yass’ largesse), the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, the Asian American Federation, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, and the Muslim Public Affairs Council all backed TikTok. Intellectual and demographic diversity filled the air. Earlier in December, a three-judge appellate panel ruled against Yass & Co. “The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here, the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States,” Judge Douglas Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, wrote. “As the government details and petitioners do not dispute, the PRC engages in an aggressive, global campaign of influence operations against U.S. interests, relying heavily on the internet and social-media platforms.” Significantly, the court also noted that the judiciary traditionally defers to the executive branch’s and Congress’s judgment on national security matters. In those circumstances, the “government’s ‘evaluation of the facts’ is ‘entitled to deference,’” Ginsburg opined. By extension, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will declare the TikTok ban unconstitutional—a reminder, in 2018, the Roberts court deferred to executive prerogative and upheld the so-called Muslim travel ban. With national security front and center, reversal here appears unlikely. Regardless of the outcome, tensions between the U.S. and China remain on the front burner. To avoid a government shutdown, Congress removed a provision from the recent continuing resolution that would have curbed American investment in China. In the eyes of House Democrats, Musk’s nexus to Beijing played a major role in scuttling the initial budget deal. Fun fact: Musk’s Tesla is the sole foreign auto manufacturer permitted to operate in China without a local partner. “His bottom line depends on staying in China’s good graces,” Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote of the world’s richest man. “He wants to build an AI data center there, too—which could endanger U.S. security. He’s been bending over backward to ingratiate himself with Chinese leaders.” Representative Rosa DeLauro, a senior Connecticut Democrat, took things further in a letter, writing: “It is particularly disturbing that Musk may have sought to upend this critical negotiated agreement to remove a bipartisan provision regulating U.S. investments in China in order to protect his wallet and the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of American workers, innovators, and businesses.” In turn, Musk called for the soon-to-be 18-term member’s expulsion from the House, labeling DeLauro an “awful creature.” As for Trump, his relationship with speech rights remains strained. In case anyone forgot, in January 2018, Trump threw a brushback pitch at author Michael Wolff over Fire and Fury, the first of multiple tell-alls emanating from his White House. Without citing any particular false content or national security concerns, Trump threatened legal action after The Guardian published pre-release excerpts from the book. No one confused Fire and Fury with the Pentagon Papers, and no one should assume Trump’s latest position on TikTok will be his last. Trump is undoubtedly mindful that popular support for restricting TikTok is minimal. Less than one-third of Americans support the ban, down from half in March 2023—the shift cuts across party lines. Republican backing for restrictions on TikTok waned from 60 percent to 42 percent. Democrats saw a similar double-digit slide, from 43 percent to 24 percent. No wonder he asked the Supreme Court to delay argument in the TikTok case until after he assumed the presidency. Ironically, a loss for Yass, TikTok, and Trump at the Court would still present the president-elect with a silver lining—more power. If the Court upholds the ban, it will feed Trump’s expansive views of executive power and his authority, even if the issue here is a legislative ban, because it’ll widen the court’s leeway for national security considerations when it comes to speech. In case anyone forgot, he has already mused about being a dictator for at least a day. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992.

Farside Investors data shows that on Jan. 2 IBIT saw $333 million worth of outflows—the highest ever reported for the Bitcoin ETF. Founder of Obchakevich Research Alex Obchakevich told Decrypt that “the main reason for the outflow is profit-taking by investors in early 2025.” “At the end of the year, investors and funds often review their investment portfolios, which can lead to the sale of some shares,” he explained. U.S.-based BTC spot ETFs overall lost $248 million on Jan. 2. IBIT was the top loser, followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with its $23 million in withdrawals—the only other product to report a negative capital net flow. Isaac Joshua—the CEO of token launch platform Gems—also told Decrypt yesterday that the recent downturn “can largely be attributed to end-of-year tax-loss harvesting by investors,” he explained. According to him, “many have liquidated both Bitcoin ETFs and the underlying asset itself to optimize their tax reports, a common phenomenon in financial markets during this period.” Still, investors remain optimistic about BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Ryan Lee—chief analyst at the research subsidiary of crypto exchange Bitget—recently highlighted in a note that “BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF is poised to accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption by simplifying access for institutional investors, enhancing its legitimacy and facilitating mainstream acceptance.” IBIT surpassed $50 billion in assets under management just 228 days after its launch—more than five times faster than any other ETF in history. “By bridging traditional finance with cryptocurrency, the ETF is expected to stabilize BTC's market perception and potentially reduce price volatility,” Joshua said. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data indicates that Bitcoin is trading at just under $96,700 after gaining 0.11% over the last 24 hours and 0.35% over the last seven days. The current price is nearly 10.7% lower than the all-time high of nearly $108,300 reported on Dec. 17. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Investors placed bets on shares of Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NYSE:NUS) at pre-market trading to buoy its prices by nearly 17 percent following news that it raised $250 million from the sale of its affiliate marketing technology platform. Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik On Friday, Nu Skin (NUS), through its subsidiary Rhyz Inc. said it completed the sale of the Mavely affiliate marketing platform to Later, a company backed by Summit Partners for $250 million. The deal included both cash and a minor equity stake in the company. Proceeds from the transaction are expected to be used to pay down debt and fund additional innovation. According to data from InvestingPro, the transaction value represents 75 percent of Nu Skin’s (NUS) current market capitalization of $326.1 million, with analysis indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. Mavely is set to merge with Later following the transaction. Approximately $33 million will be paid to other equity holders in the Mavely business. The transaction is expected to provide Nu Skin (NUS) with enhanced capabilities as it continues to develop a beauty, wellness, and lifestyle ecosystem. “Together, we believe Later and Mavely will provide enhanced capabilities to our company as we pursue our broader beauty, wellness, and lifestyle ecosystem vision, while the transaction generates additional capital and resources for us to increase innovation in our core Nu Skin business and investment in our Rhyz companies,” Nu Skin (NUS) President and Chief Executive Officer Ryan Napierski said. “This underscores the value of Rhyz to incubate and scale meaningful businesses with synergistic value across the enterprise,” he added. The transaction was said to have generated an approximate five times return on Nu Skin’s (NUS) cumulative investment in Mavely since acquiring the latter in 2021. The company also plans to use its strengthened balance sheet to buy back stock under its existing stock repurchase program, providing value to its shareholders. Nu Skin (NUS) is an integrated beauty and wellness company that operates in nearly 50 markets worldwide. It boasts of brands including Nu Skin personal care, Pharmanex nutrition, and ageLOC anti-aging.

Title: A $24 Billion Fund Puts Its Religious Stamp on Corporate America
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/01/03/806788.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-03T14:09:40Z
Full Content:
Jim Lake, a devout Christian in Washington state, said his religious beliefs have always made him opposed to practices such as abortion, transgender transitions or embryonic stem cell research. But until this past year, it didn’t cross the retiree’s mind that he could put his money to work with his faith. A financial adviser switched Lake’s portfolio over to a handful of faith-friendly funds, one of which was run by GuideStone Funds, a 106-year-old investment firm in Texas that oversees some $24 billion in assets. The company caters to Southern Baptist retirees and, increasingly, newly active faith-based investors such as Lake and his wife. GuideStone is part of a nascent coalition of conservative Christian investors that are starting to flex their muscles and use their shareholder clout to counter progressive corporate policies such as funding Pride parades or covering employees’ travel costs for abortions. They’re also zeroing in on banks for allegedly closing customer accounts on political and religious grounds. By some measures, there’s now half a trillion dollars in investments spread across conservative faith-based private funds and state pension funds that can be brought to bear to influence company behavior, said Will Lofland, who oversees shareholder advocacy at GuideStone. The loose confederation includes Inspire Investing, the biggest faith-based exchange-traded fund manager; Republican state treasurers and teacher pension funds; and Alliance Defending Freedom, an influential conservative legal group. As they attract more money, members of the coalition are meeting with corporate executives and filing shareholder proposals. They’ve had limited success so far, yet aim to build their bloc of supporters and target more companies this year, Lofland said. The investors “want to honor the Lord with all of their resources,” he said. “They want their dollars being invested in what they believe is the God-honoring way.” Religious investing has been around for decades, often with a focus on more liberal issues such as worker rights and climate change. But funds such as GuideStone have been emboldened by the rightward shift of US politics and the wave of conservative activists and lawyers who have already pushed companies to curtail or end programs that support diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Many point to anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck, a non-denominational Christian, and his success in getting companies such as Walmart Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Harley-Davidson Inc. to backtrack on initiatives — particularly those related to LGBTQ causes. Among everyday investors, there is growing interest in religious-based funds, said Tim Macready, head of global multi asset investing at Brightlight, which advises investors on faith-based portfolios. Assets in faith-friendly ETFs and mutual funds exceeded $100 billion for the first time last year, according to annual study conducted by the firm. The analysis, compiled from 27 faith-based asset mangers, likely captures only a portion of the activity. The full universe could range from $200 billion to $500 billion, Macready said. Net inflows have been 12% over the last three years, he said. One broker-dealer went from 200 advisers working with GuideStone in 2021 to more than 2,000 now, Lofland said. Inspire said it had net new assets of $334 million last year. GuideStone’s biggest fund, the GuideStone Equity Index Fund, gained 20% last year, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Lake, a 64-year-old resident of Nine Mile Falls, Washington, invested with GuideStone after being introduced to an adviser whose sole practice is working with people investing in faith-friendly funds. “It really opened up my eyes to the ability to remain faith-friendly and at the same time, be competitive,” Lake said. Building a Bloc GuideStone operates out of a nondescript office building overlooking a freeway in northern Dallas, and maintained such a low profile that Lofland said he didn’t know about the funds until he applied to work there. The firm mainly manages pension investments for Baptist churches, yet Lofland saw an opportunity to become more active. Shareholder proposals from progressive groups, some pushing ideas such as transgender benefits contrary to the church’s values, started to proliferate a few years ago and GuideStone wasn’t voting its shares to oppose such measures, Lofland said. He decided to take control of how GuideStone voted on the shares it owns in companies rather than relying on outside advisers. One of the investor’s first efforts was in late 2023, when it backed a shareholder proposal from a conservative group asking Microsoft Corp. to report on compensation and benefit gaps across genders as the company addressed reproductive and gender dysphoria care. The resolution won only 1% of votes. (Bloomberg Intelligence says overall support for conservative proposals at US companies is only about 2%.) Lofland says that’s why the religious funds need to build a bigger group of supporters, particularly from pension funds from conservative states. Such investors have already done some agitating of their own: Last year, finance officials from 15 states signed a letter to Fortune 1000 companies in support of ending DEI programs. Collectively, they managed about $590 billion, according to US Census data. That type of firepower is needed to counter efforts that have strong progressive backing. In July, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander urged five large retailers, including Walmart and Costco Wholesale Corp., to dispense abortion pills. City funds controlled $1.3 billion in shares of those companies, he said. A coalition of conservatives and religious investors, including Inspire and GuideStone, responded with their own letter the following month saying offering the pill would add risk, but only represented $172 million in shares of those retailers. Lofland said GuideStone’s first initiative in 2025 will be to press a financial firm regarding the practice of debanking — the closure of customer accounts that are deemed by lenders to pose legal or reputational risks. He declined to name the bank. GuideStone had previously supported other group’s efforts to pressure JPMorgan Chase & Co. after the lender was accused of improperly closing accounts for the nonprofit National Committee for Religious Freedom. Michael Fusco, a spokesman for the bank, said “we have never and would never close an account for political or religious reasons, period.” Lawsuits, Proxy Votes Inspire Investing and Knights of Columbus are among other faith-based investors working to influence corporate behavior. Inspire joined a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group run by Trump advisor Stephen Miller against Target Corp. that accuses the retailer of costing investors billions of dollars after its sale of LGBTQ merchandise led to a consumer boycott. Last month, a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the case and change its venue out of Florida. Target, which in response cut LGBTQ-themed products from some its stores, declined to comment. Inspire, which oversees about $3.2 billion, last year filed almost two dozen shareholder resolutions over DEI topics. It plans to file more in 2025. “As stewards of what we believe are God’s dollars, it’s our job to speak Biblical truth to corporate power,” said Robert Netzly, founder of the Meridian, Idaho-based investment firm. Knights of Columbus is working to develop proxy voting rules that follow guidelines established by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Anthony Minopoli, president and chief investment officer of Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors, which manages about $28 billion. The group is partnering with the Busch School of Business at the Catholic University of America on the effort, which aims to get Catholic dioceses to adopt the guidelines to ensure they are voting based on the beliefs of the church. The group also will likely engage with companies on topics ranging from abortion to the manufacture of land mines and cluster bombs, which violate church values as set forward by USCCB, Minopoli said. Even if the coalitions of conservative and religious groups don’t get strong shareholder support for their proposals, they will likely succeed in swaying corporate executives, according to Amelia Miazad, an acting law professor at University of California, Davis who is researching a project on faith-based investors. She likened the efforts to the backlash to environmental, social and governance strategies, which has seen asset management giants including BlackRock Inc. cut the number of new funds with that mandate. “If success means silencing corporate speech on environmental and social issues, then these investors will be as successful as the anti-ESG movement has been,” she said.

Title: Is SelectQuote, Inc. (SLQT) Among the Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025.

To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $3.72 5-Year Sales Growth: 34.42% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13 SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) is an insurance and healthcare services company. The company uses technology to connect consumers directly with insurance products, allowing them to compare options from multiple providers easily. It operates through a series of business lines including SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Healthcare Services, SelectQuote Life, and SelectQuote Auto and Home. The company has implemented highly targeted lead-sourcing strategies for policy origination, which have proven effective during the Annual Enrollment Period (AEP). This approach is critical as SelectQuote aims to optimize cash flow and improve its balance sheet. Moreover, it is also leveraging AI tools to enhance operational efficiency by screening and prioritizing calls, thus simplifying processes behind the scenes. These effective marketing strategies resulted in a 26% year-over-year increase in revenue, totaling $292.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up from $232.7 million in the same period last year. In addition to revenue, the company also improved its adjusted EBITDA by reducing the loss by nearly $10 million, from negative $11.4 million last year to negative $1.7 million during the current fiscal year. On the bright side, its healthcare segment saw membership grow by 64%, reaching over 86,000 members. This segment has now recorded six consecutive quarters of profitability, demonstrating strong operational execution. Management anticipates continued success driven by its strategic initiatives in both Senior distribution and Healthcare Services. Overall, SLQT ranks 7th on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of SLQT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLQT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) on The Net Worth Club’s Substack by Danny Brody. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TTWO. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)'s share was trading at $183.07 as of Jan 2nd. TTWO’s forward P/E was 23.87 according to Yahoo Finance. A computer technician working on a video game console with a gaming headset. Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO), the company behind hit franchises like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and NBA 2K, is positioning itself as a prime player in the gaming industry despite facing a recent net loss of $1.125 billion, largely attributed to write-downs and impairment charges. For fiscal 2024, Take-Two reported $5.35 billion in revenue, placing it among the industry's elite. While its profitability has been affected by one-time events, the recurring revenue from its core franchises offers a strong foundation for future growth. This resilience and the potential for a turnaround make TTWO an appealing investment, especially for those looking beyond short-term setbacks. The gaming industry is experiencing significant consolidation, and TTWO stands out as an attractive acquisition target, especially as tech giants like Microsoft continue to strengthen their positions by acquiring major content providers. Amazon’s rumored interest in gaming via acquisition further underscores TTWO’s potential. With a market cap of $32 billion, Take-Two is still smaller than Activision Blizzard, which was acquired by Microsoft for $75 billion, making it an affordable target relative to its intrinsic value. Take-Two's shift toward recurring revenue models, such as subscription services, in-game purchases, and free-to-play models, aligns with broader industry trends. The upcoming release of highly anticipated titles like Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to drive significant revenue growth. The release of GTA 6, following the success of GTA 5, could generate more than $10 billion in revenue for Take-Two, cementing its position as a leader in the gaming industry. If TTWO were valued similarly to Activision, applying an 8.5x revenue multiple would push its valuation to $45.5 billion, or about $256 per share—substantially higher than its current market price. With its strong intellectual property, expanding revenue models, and exciting pipeline, Take-Two is well-positioned for both short-term gains and long-term growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity in the evolving gaming landscape. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 46 hedge fund portfolios held TTWO at the end of the third quarter which was 48 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of TTWO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TTWO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

East Village Bar in Douglas Long-standing Douglas pub East Village has said it is "time to say goodbye" after operating in the town for more than two decades. The bar is set to be transferred to new ownership and will close from Monday, January 6 to facilitate a "smooth transition" for the new owners. In a post shared on its social media, the bar said it will also be hosting a farewell party to celebrate the last 20 years in business.

Frax intends to be the US digital dollar and to establish itself as "the world's most innovative decentralised stablecoin and DeFi stablecoin infrastructure." 1 03 January 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Decentralised stablecoin cryptocurrency protocol Frax Finance has launched a new stablecoin, frxUSD, that will leverage BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and will be tokenised by Securitize. Securitize will drive the compliant digitisation of financial assets through blockchain technology. Securitize, or through its subsidiaries, is also a registered broker-dealer and operates a primary marketplace, an alternative trading system, as well as a transfer agent and has an exempt reporting adviser. The frxUSD stablecoin, a rebrand of Frax's FRAX stablecoin, will offer direct fiat redemption capabilities and enhanced compliance with US financial systems. BUIDL will also become an enshrined custodian asset for minting and redeeming frxUSD. This means that the stablecoin will be uniquely backed by assets held in BlackRock's BUIDL, which invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. This bolsters transparency and on-chain audibility, solidifying frxUSD as the first stablecoin to offer seamless fiat on/off-ramping capabilities via Blackrock's BUIDL infrastructure. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, says: "Tokenized real-world assets provide an excellent bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing institutional-grade investments on-chain with unprecedented transparency and efficiency. This collaboration exemplifies the next stage in financial evolution, demonstrating how traditional and decentralized systems can work together to redefine asset management strategies. The integration of frxUSD and the BUIDL fund is a clear signal of the transformative potential of tokenization in modern finance." Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, adds: "By partnering with Securitize to access and leverage BlackRock's BUIDL Fund we are setting a new standard for stablecoins. frxUSD combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology with the trust and stability of BlackRock's prime treasury offerings. This collaboration is a significant step toward bridging traditional finance with decentralized systems."

Title: Happy Birthday, Bitcoin! The top cryptocurrency is old enough to drive

Bitcoin is now 16 years old! Satoshi Nakamoto, a name used by the creator (or creators) of Bitcoin, mined the first Bitcoin block on Jan. 3, 2009. This “genesis” block followed the release of a Bitcoin whitepaper on October 31, 2008, which laid the foundation for the now-leading cryptocurrency. 2024 proved to be a landmark year for Bitcoin, culminating in an all-time high of $108,135 in December. Hypothetically, had someone invested $1,000 in Bitcoin on January 3, 2024, they would have witnessed a 115% growth in their investment, and seen it rise to $2,150. Over the past 16 years, Bitcoin has grown from a novel idea into a global phenomenon, shaping the cryptocurrency market and disrupting financial systems worldwide. From its humble beginnings in 2009, to its climb to $1 in 2011, and to its momentary rise above $100,000 in 2024, the journey so far reflects Bitcoin’s disruptive power. Let’s dive deeper into Bitcoin’s journey and see how it came to be a mainstream asset. Bitcoin rocketed in popularity after COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2021, it gained acceptance in mainstream finance with endorsements from influential figures. One of the pivotal moments was its inclusion in 401(k) plans, which marked a significant shift in how traditional retirement savings strategies embraced digital assets. After a prolonged bear market connected to the FTX collapse in 2022, Bitcoin made a strong comeback in 2024. Early on in the year, Bitcoin reached a high of $73,000 due to the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by the U.K.’s approval of Bitcoin-linked securities being listed on the stock market. In a year alone, the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over $21 billion in total net flows, a noteworthy achievement considering the typical challenges faced by new ETFs. By comparison, it took gold ETFs around five years to reach the same level of net inflows. Adding to the 2021 momentum, high-profile endorsements from business leaders, including Tesla (TSLA+8.10%) CEO Elon Musk, played a crucial role in amplifying Bitcoin’s appeal. In 2021, Tesla spent $1.5 billion on the cryptocurrency. Other publicly traded companies also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As of Dec. 30, 2024, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy owns the most at 446,400 Bitcoin. The entry of financial giants including BlackRock and Fidelity into the crypto world has bolstered the proposition that cryptocurrency could be the future of finance. Financial institutions are working on the tokenization of funds, and they seem to no longer see blockchain as a threat but rather as a tool.

This figure surpasses the previous record of $188 million set during the holiday season last year. The latest outflow marks IBIT’s third consecutive trading day of losses, amounting to $392.6 million in the past week. Despite these challenges, IBIT remains the leading spot Bitcoin ETF, with total net inflows of $36.9 billion and assets under management nearing $53.5 billion. While IBIT struggled, competitors showed resilience. Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark 21Shares’s ARKB reported inflows of $48.3 million, $36.2 million, and $16.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin products recorded divergent fates on the day. Per the data, the firm’s smaller Bitcoin Mini Trust attracted $6.9 million in fresh capital, though its flagship GBTC fund saw outflows of $23.1 million. As of Jan. 2, spot Bitcoin ETFs have a cumulative flow of $35 billion and hold $109 billion in assets. Ethereum ETFs also faced challenges, recording a combined outflow of $77.5 million.

Other Ethereum-linked ETFs, including BlackRock’s ETHA, reported no changes in fund flows for the day. Ethereum-focused ETFs held a combined total of $2.58 billion in net inflows, with $12.4 billion in assets. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Kiwi sharemarket falls in first day of trading for 2025 - market close

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Shares in Sylvia Park mall owner Kiwi Property Group rose after BlackRock reduced its stake. Photo / NZ Herald The New Zealand sharemarket had a weak start to the year with the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 falling in light trading. The index closed down 0.33% at 13,067.83, a drop of 42.91 points on trading of 21.78 million shares worth $93.47 million. There were 52 decliners and 90 gainers on the main board. Shane Solly, portfolio manager with Harbour Asset Management, said the market was weak after a slightly weaker United States market overnight. “The volume isn’t very high and so the difference between today and the last day of last year is more ups than downs today, and so we’ve seen a bit of reversion.” Solly said some of the stocks that had a strong 2024 had given back a bit of that performance today. “We’re seeing the market down on weakness from things like Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland Airport, Infratil and Mainfreight. “There’s just a bit of profit taking there.” Shares in Fisher & Paykel fell 1.04% or 40c to $38, while Auckland Airport was down 1.95% or 17c to $8.53. Infratil declined 1.87% or 23.5c to $12.365 and Mainfreight ended the day a touch lower, dropping 1c to $73.49. Solly said people were taking a more cautious wait-and-see approach. Long-term bond yields, the 10-year government bond yields, had been tracking higher off the back of question marks around what the incoming US President Donald Trump might do. Solly expected the market to continue to be quiet next week with many people still away on holiday but there could be updates from some retail companies in late January which will reveal how the Christmas shopping period went for them. Retail spending data showed while Boxing Day had been strong, activity was weaker in the lead-up to Christmas. Some property stocks had a bit of a bounce and BlackRock had sold some of its shares in Kiwi Property Group, reducing its stake from 5.334% to 4.981%. Kiwi Property shares rose 1.11% or 1c to 91c, Precinct Properties was up 2.97% or 3.5c to $1.215 and Argosy Property climbed 1.5% or 1.5c to $1.015. One area Solly was keeping an eye on was the Chinese sharemarket which had a weak day on Thursday. Investors were hoping for more stimulus to come. “We need the Chinese economy to be at least stabilising for some of our exporters. It’s probably had the weakest start [to the year] for some time. And so there’s a bit of weariness about that.” Blis Technologies, Sky Network Television and Pacific Edge saw the biggest percentage jumps in their share prices. Blis rose 6.67% or 0.001c to 1.6c, Sky was up 5.77% or 15c to 2.75 and Pacific Edge climbed 5.6% or 0.007c to 13.2c. General Capital, Promisia Healthcare and Eroad saw the biggest percentage declines. Eroad was down 5.31% or 6c to $1.07. Wall Street stocks opened 2025 on a tepid note falling modestly as markets await a heavier news flow later in January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4% at 42,392.27. The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 5868.55, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.2% to 19,280.79. - additional reporting AFP Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Read Between the Lies: A Pattern Recognition Guide

EditorEconomy Brownstone Institute, josh stylman Josh Stylman Brownstone Institute When Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, announced during Event 201’s pandemic drill in 2019 that they would “flood the zone with trusted sources,” few understood this preview of coordinated narrative control. Within months, we watched it unfold in real time—unified messaging across all platforms, suppression of dissent, and coordinated narrative control that fooled much of the world. But not everyone stayed fooled forever. Some saw through it immediately, questioning every aspect from day one. Others thought it was just incompetent government trying to protect us. Many initially accepted the precautionary principle—better safe than sorry. But as each policy failure pointed in the same direction—toward more control and less human agency—the pattern became impossible to ignore. Anyone not completely subsumed by the system eventually had to confront its true purpose: not protecting health or safety, but expanding control. Once you recognize this pattern of deception, two questions should immediately arise whenever major stories dominate headlines: “What are they lying about?” and “What are they distracting us from?” The pattern of coordinated deception becomes unmistakable. Consider how media outlets spent three years pushing Russiagate conspiracies, driving unprecedented social division while laying the groundwork for what would become the greatest psychological operation in history. Today, while the media floods us with Ukraine coverage, BlackRock positions itself to profit from both the destruction and reconstruction. The pattern becomes unmistakable once you see it—manufactured crises driving pre-planned “solutions” that always expand institutional control. Mainstream media operates on twin deceptions: misdirection and manipulation. The same anchors who sold us WMDs in Iraq, promoted “Russia collusion,” and insisted Hunter Biden’s laptop was “Russian disinformation” still occupy prime time slots. Just as we see with RFK, Jr.’s HHS nomination, the pattern is consistent: coordinated attacks replace substantive debate, identical talking points appear across networks, and legitimate questions are dismissed through character assassination rather than evidence. Being consistently wrong isn’t a bug—it’s a feature. Their role isn’t to inform but to manufacture consent. The template is consistent: Saturate media with emotional spectacles while advancing institutional agendas with minimal scrutiny. Like learning to spot a fake smile or hearing a false note in music, you develop an instinct for the timing: Money and Power: Medical Control: Digital Control: As these deceptions become more obvious, different forms of resistance emerge. The truth-seeking takes different forms. Some become deep experts in specific deceptions—documenting early treatment successes with repurposed drugs, uncovering hospital protocol failures, or exploring the impact of vaccine injuries. Others develop a broader lens for seeing how narratives themselves are engineered. Walter Kirn’s brilliant pattern recognition cuts to the heart of our manufactured reality. His tweets dissecting the United CEO murder coverage expose how even violent crimes are now packaged as entertainment spectacles, complete with character arcs and narrative twists. Kirn’s insight highlights a critical dimension of media control: by turning every crisis into an entertainment narrative, they divert attention from deeper questions. Instead of asking why institutional safeguards fail or who benefits, audiences become captivated by carefully scripted outrage. This deliberate distraction ensures that institutional agendas move forward without scrutiny. His insight reveals how entertainment packaging serves the broader control system. While each investigation requires its own expertise, this pattern of narrative manipulation connects to a larger grid of deception. As I’ve explored in “The Information Factory” and “Engineering Reality,” everything from education to medicine to currency itself has been captured by systems designed to shape not just our choices, but our very perception of reality. Most revealing is what they don’t cover. Notice how quickly stories disappear when they threaten institutional interests. Remember the Epstein client list? The Maui land grab? The mounting vaccine injuries? The silence speaks volumes. Consider the recent whistleblower testimonies revealing suppressed safety concerns at Boeing, a company long entangled with regulatory agencies and government contracts. Two whistleblowers—both former employees who raised alarms about safety issues—died under suspicious circumstances. Coverage of their deaths disappeared almost overnight, despite the profound implications for public safety and corporate accountability. This pattern repeats in countless cases where accountability would disrupt entrenched power structures, leaving crucial questions unanswered and narratives tightly controlled. These decisions aren’t accidental—they result from media ownership, advertiser influence, and government pressure, ensuring the narrative remains tightly controlled. But perhaps most striking isn’t the media’s deception itself, but how thoroughly it shapes its consumers’ reality. Watch how confidently they repeat phrases clearly engineered in think tanks. Listen as they parrot talking points with religious conviction: “January 6th was worse than 9/11,” “Trust The Science™,” “Democracy is on the ballot” and, perhaps the most consequential lie in modern history, “Safe and Effective.” The professional-managerial class proves especially susceptible to this programming. Their expertise becomes a prison of status—the more they’ve invested in institutional approval, the more fervently they defend institutional narratives. Watch how quickly a doctor who questions vaccine safety loses his license, how swiftly a professor questioning gender ideology faces review, how rapidly a journalist stepping out of line gets blacklisted. The system ensures compliance through economic capture: your mortgage becomes your leash, your professional status your prison guard. The same lawyers who prides themselves on critical thinking will aggressively shut down any questioning of official narratives. The professor who teaches “questioning power structures” becomes apoplectic when students question pharmaceutical companies. The circular validation makes the programming nearly impenetrable: This self-reinforcing system forms a perfect closed loop: Each component validates the others while excluding outside information. Try finding the entry point for actual truth in this closed system. The professional class’s pride in their critical thinking becomes darkly ironic—they’ve simply outsourced their opinions to “authoritative sources.” Most disturbing is how willingly they’ve surrendered their sovereignty. Watch them defer: Their empathy becomes a weapon used against them. Question lockdowns? You’re killing grandma. Doubt transition surgery for minors? You’re causing suicides. Resist equity initiatives? You’re perpetuating oppression. The programming works by making resistance feel like cruelty. Something remarkable is happening beneath the surface noise: a genuine awakening that defies traditional political boundaries. You see it in the subtle exchanges between colleagues when official narratives strain credibility. In the growing silence at dinner parties as propaganda talking points fall flat. In the knowing looks between strangers when public health theatre reaches new heights of absurdity. This isn’t a movement in the traditional sense—it can’t be, since traditional movement structures are vulnerable to infiltration, subversion, and capture. Instead, it’s more like a spontaneous emergence of pattern recognition. A distributed awakening without central leadership or formal organization. Those who see through the patterns recognize the mass formation for what it is, while its subjects project their own programming onto others, dismissing pattern recognition as “conspiracy theories,” “anti-science,” or other reflexive labels designed to prevent genuine examination. The hardest truth isn’t recognizing the programming—it’s confronting what it means for human consciousness and society itself. We’re watching real-time evidence that most human minds can be captured and redirected through sophisticated psychological operations. Their thoughts aren’t their own, yet they’d die defending what they’ve been programmed to believe. This isn’t just media criticism anymore—it’s an existential question about human consciousness and free will. What does it mean when a species’ capacity for independent thought can be so thoroughly hijacked? When natural empathy and moral instincts become weapons of control? When education and expertise actually decrease resistance to programming? The programming works because it hijacks core human drives: Each natural human trait becomes a vulnerability to be exploited. The most educated become the most programmable because their status addiction runs deepest. Their “critical thinking” becomes a script running on corrupted hardware. This is the core challenge of our time: Can human consciousness evolve faster than the systems designed to hijack it? Can pattern recognition and awareness spread faster than manufactured consensus? Can enough people learn to read between the lies before the programming becomes complete? The stakes could not be higher. This isn’t just about politics or media literacy—it’s about the future of human consciousness itself. Whether our species maintains the capacity for independent thought may depend on those who can still access it helping others break free from the spell. The matrix of control deepens daily, but so does the awakening. The question is: Which spreads faster—the programming or the awareness of it? Our future as a species may depend on the answer.

Title: Frax Partners With Securitize on New Stablecoin
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/frax-partners-with-securitize-on-new-stablecoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T00:54:40Z

Decentralized stablecoin cryptocurrency protocol Frax Finance launched a stablecoin that it said offers “unprecedented” transparency and custody. The frxUSD stablecoin is a rebranded evolution of the company’s flagship FRAX stablecoin and will leverage BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), tokenized by Securitize, Frax said in a Thursday (Jan. 2) press release. The new stablecoin offers direct fiat redemption capabilities and enhanced compliance with U.S. financial systems, according to the release. “By partnering with Securitize to access and leverage BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund we are setting a new standard for stablecoins,” Frax Finance Founder Sam Kazemian said in the release. “frxUSD combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology with the trust and stability of BlackRock’s prime treasury offerings.” In this new collaboration around the stablecoin, BUIDL will become an enshrined custodian asset for minting and redeeming frxUSD; the stablecoin will be backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements held in BUIDL; and frxUSD will offer seamless fiat on/off-ramping capabilities via the BUIDL infrastructure, per the release. “Tokenized real-world assets provide an excellent bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing institutional-grade investments on-chain with unprecedented transparency and efficiency,” Securitize Co-Founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in the release. “This collaboration exemplifies the next stage in financial evolution, demonstrating how traditional and decentralized systems can work together to redefine asset management strategies.” Stablecoins are emerging as a powerful tool bridging the gap between traditional financial technology and the world of cryptocurrencies, PYMNTS reported in October. As cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset (usually a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro), stablecoins are able to offer the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology while providing the familiarity and stability of fiat currencies. In another, separate development, it was reported Thursday that stablecoin leader Tether has seen its market value decline amid new European Union (EU) cryptocurrency rules, with the company’s USDT having its sharpest weekly drop in two years. USDT had reached a record market value in mid-December but declined after several EU-based exchanges and Coinbase removed the stablecoin due to compliance issues with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that took full effect on Dec. 30. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Morgan Stanley Is Latest Bank to Exit UN-backed Climate Group

Morgan Stanley became the latest major bank to quit the U.N.-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 2, the New York-based financial services company said it had “decided to withdraw” from the voluntary climate pact sponsored by the U.N. Environment Programme Finance Initiative. In a statement, Morgan Stanley said its “commitment to net-zero remains unchanged.” “We aim to contribute to real-economy decarbonization by providing our clients with the advice and capital required to transform business models and reduce carbon intensity,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed emissions targets.” Representatives of Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times. Net zero is a term for the practice of balancing greenhouse gas emissions with the amount taken out of the atmosphere. Morgan Stanley has published an environmental and social policy statement. The document, most recently updated in September 2024, says the company considers emissions when financing projects related to the generation of electricity as well as to oil and gas exploration and development. “Our approach to managing climate risks, including transition risks and physical risks, and pursuing transition finance opportunities is informed by our climate strategy and overall goal of achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050,” it said in the document. On its website, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance calls itself a “group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” In its most recent annual progress report, published in October 2024, the group said its membership has grown to 144 banks since its founding in April 2021. Representatives of the alliance declined to comment on the Morgan Stanley decision. With its Thursday decision, Morgan Stanley joined a rash of U.S. banks that have departed the alliance within the past month. On Dec. 31, Citigroup and Bank of America said they were leaving the alliance. Those exits followed the December exit of Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. In November, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, filed an anti-trust suit against BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street Corp. In a statement released on Nov. 27, Paxton said the three companies “formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices.” The three companies weaponized influence from their stock holdings to pressure coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals and reduce coal output by more than half by 2030, Paxton’s statement said.

Title: FBI Claims to Disrupt Florida Plot to Attack Pro-Israel Organization

Time Published: 2025-01-02T22:17:51Z
Full Content:
The FBI filed court documents this week accusing Gainesville, Florida, resident Forrest Kendall Pemberton of plotting to attack the South Florida offices of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) with multiple firearms. Pemberton, 26, was reported missing by his father on December 23. His father, unnamed in police reports, told the Gainesville police department he received a text message from Pemberton advising him to look in the backpack he left in his bedroom. The backpack proved to contain a “concerning” note that “espoused anti-authority sentiments” and looked disturbingly like a farewell message. Pemberton’s father added that his son had previously “espoused antisemitic views.” Pemberton’s father said the search history in his son’s browser included various government offices and prominent entities, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), Blackrock, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and AIPAC. Pemberton’s searches also included information on various assassination methods, including the use of poisons and vehicles as weapons. Most disturbingly under the circumstances, Pemberton owned several firearms, including two rifles and a pistol, which were missing from his room. His father thought he might have been planning an assault similar to the December 4 murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Everything We Know About Dual New Years Terror Attacks with Joel Pollak Police investigators tracked Pemberton down to a motel in Plantation, Florida, where his browser history indicated he had researched the location of an AIPAC office. AIPAC relocated its office some time ago, but Google Maps still pointed to the old address. The police learned that Pemberton stayed at the motel in Plantation for only one day, checking out on December 24 and resurfacing in Tallahassee, where he employed ride-sharing service Uber to get from an auto shop to a Red Roof Inn. The FBI kept the hotel under surveillance and intercepted Pemberton when he was getting into another rideshare vehicle. He was carrying all three of his firearms when he was intercepted on December 25, which in 2024 was both Christmas Day and the first day of Hanukkah. Pemberton told investigators he was using rideshares because his original plan had involved walking from Gainesville to nearby Ocala, where he purchased a very cheap Ford F-150 truck he apparently intended to use in a criminal assault. The F-150 apparently gave him some trouble on the road to Tallahassee. In its affidavit to prosecutors, the FBI said Pemberton targeted AIPAC because of its “political influence” and his “frustration with the status quo.” Asked if he was planning a suicide attack, he said he had not settled on the “suicide” part yet. “Um, I really don’t know if I was gonna end it with my life or not. I hadn’t gotten that far yet. It entirely depended if I ended up getting caught or not. If caught, that was a way out,” he said. “It would have been a one-way ticket. In Plantation, I decided I wasn’t ready. I gave up,” he said. The FBI affidavit was vague about exactly what Pemberton was doing in Tallahassee, which is on the opposite side of the huge Florida peninsula from Plantation, requiring at least seven hours of driving time. The most efficient route between the two cities would have taken Pemberton through his hometown of Gainesville. Tallahassee is the state capital, so it is possible Pemberton was contemplating another target after canceling his alleged plan to attack AIPAC in Plantation. AIPAC was not mentioned by name in the affidavit, being described only as an organization dedicated to “pro-Israel policies that strengthen and expand the U.S.-Israel relationship,” but AIPAC confirmed it was the intended target in a statement on Tuesday. “We will not be deterred by extremists in pursuing our mission to strengthen the relationship with America’s valued ally, Israel. We are deeply appreciative of the FBI’s work to stop this individual,” AIPAC said. The Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Pemberton with stalking on Monday, and contended he was scouting AIPAC offices with the intent of “killing, injuring, harassing, and intimidating” members of the organization. Pemberton’s case is scheduled for a hearing on Monday at the U.S. Courthouse in Gainesville. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

BlackRock Enhanced Government Fund, Inc. (NYSE: EGF), BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (NYSE: DSU), BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund, Inc. (NYSE: FRA), BlackRock Floating Rate Income Trust (NYSE: BGT), BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc. (NYSE: HYT), BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE: BTZ), BlackRock Limited Duration Income Trust (NYSE: BLW), BlackRock Core Bond Trust (NYSE: BHK), BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (NYSE: BIT), BlackRock Income Trust, Inc. (NYSE: BKT) and BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (NYSE: BBN) have adopted a Plan to support a level monthly distribution of income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available net income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Code. If sufficient income (inclusive of net investment income and short-term capital gains) is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. Each of the above-listed Funds is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. Each Fund may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act. Each Fund's estimated sources of the distributions paid as of December 23, 2024 and for its current fiscal year are as follows: Estimated Allocations as of December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital EGF2 $0.041000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.041000 (100%) BKT2 $0.088200 $0.031842 (36%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.056358 (64%) DSU2 $0.098730 $0.066477 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.032253 (33%) FRA2 $0.123840 $0.082821 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.041019 (33%) BBN2 $0.092900 $0.075240 (81%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.017660 (19%) BGT2 $0.120280 $0.077761 (65%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.042519 (35%) HYT2 $0.077900 $0.057524 (74%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.020376 (26%) BTZ2 $0.083900 $0.053653 (64%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.030247 (36%) BLW2 $0.113200 $0.086118 (76%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.027082 (24%) BHK2 $0.074600 $0.046016 (62%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.028584 (38%) BIT2 $0.123700 $0.074047 (60%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.049653 (40%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital EGF2 $0.492000 $0.347520 (71%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.144480 (29%) BKT2 $1.058400 $0.407235 (38%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.651165 (62%) DSU2 $1.184760 $0.868317 (73%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.316443 (27%) FRA2 $1.486080 $1.167738 (79%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.318342 (21%) BBN2 $1.114800 $0.909791 (82%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.205009 (18%) BGT2 $1.443360 $1.035274 (72%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.408086 (28%) HYT2 $0.934800 $0.708910 (76%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.225890 (24%) BTZ2 $1.006800 $0.674191 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.332609 (33%) BLW2 $1.326600 $1.109627 (84%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.216973 (16%) BHK2 $0.895200 $0.565787 (63%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.329413 (37%) BIT2 $1.484400 $0.919736 (62%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.564664 (38%) 2The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send its stockholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will illustrate how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Each Plan will be subject to ongoing review by the Board to determine whether the Plan should be continued, modified or terminated. The Board may amend the terms of a Plan or suspend or terminate a Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's shareholders if it deems such actions to be in the best interest of the Fund or its shareholders.

Title: Bloomberg Highlights BlackRock’s Bitcoin Fund As The Greatest ETF Launch In History
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bloomberg-highlights-blackrocks-bitcoin-fund/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T21:30:12Z
Full Content:
According to Bloomberg, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new benchmark in the world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since its launch in January 2024. With over $50 billion in assets amassed in just 11 months, IBIT has achieved a feat unparalleled in the industry, outpacing traditional funds that have been operating for decades. BlackRock’s foray into the Bitcoin market has been a pivotal moment not only for BTC, but also for the broader cryptocurrency market. With over $11 trillion in assets under management, the firm’s endorsement has contributed to Bitcoin’s move beyond the $100,000 mark for the first time, ushering in a wave of institutional interest and attracting investors who were previously skeptical about the digital asset. However, the journey to establishing a spot-Bitcoin ETF in the United States has been fraught with challenges. The Winklevoss twins pioneered the effort in 2013, only to face repeated rejections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale Investments, on the other hand, spearheaded a legal battle against the SEC, culminating in a crucial victory in 2023 when a federal appeals court overturned the agency’s prior rejection of its ETF application. As the landscape shifted, BlackRock’s entry, led by CEO Larry Fink—who had once disparaged Bitcoin—signaled a significant change in attitude within traditional finance. Once the SEC granted approval in January 2024, BlackRock and other firms such as Fidelity and VanEck successfully launched the first cohort of US ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin, collectively amassing around $107 billion in assets. Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities, highlighted that IBIT’s rapid growth eclipses the combined assets of more than 50 European-focused ETFs, many of which have been established for over 20 years. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, aptly described IBIT as “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart also noted that IBIT is the fastest ETF to reach significant milestones, further solidifying its status as a revolutionary product in the financial landscape. Amidst a growing spot Bitcoin ETF market, IBIT has distinguished itself with its rapid asset growth, reaching over $50 billion five times faster than the next closest fund, which took nearly four years. As it stands, IBIT has surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF, the second-largest gold fund globally, despite significant inflows into that fund this year. The impact of IBIT on Bitcoin’s market dynamics is profound. The ETF has been instrumental in Bitcoin’s 118% price rally year-to-date, with IBIT accounting for over 50% of daily trading volume among Bitcoin ETFs. IBIT also made history by being the first Bitcoin ETF to offer options, which have quickly become some of the most traded contracts in the ETF market, averaging about $1.7 billion in daily notional volume. According to research from Asym500, other Bitcoin ETFs have struggled to achieve similar levels of trading activity, highlighting IBIT’s dominance. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, BTC, is trading at $97,190, recording a gain of nearly 3% in the 24-hour time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Headlines Shaping Wall Street for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stands against the other AI stocks. As reported by Reuters, Wall Street’s major indexes started the final trading session of 2024 on a high note, continuing the two-year-long bull market. This was marked by economic recovery after the pandemic, hopes for lower interest rates, and excitement about the AI boom. All three major stock market indexes, the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq, are near record highs and ready for their second consecutive year of gains. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss Despite an overall good year, late 2024 saw a pullback in artificial intelligence stocks. From profit-taking and investors locking in gains from the year's substantial rallies to concerns over high valuations and the Federal Reserve's cautious stance signaling fewer interest rate cuts in 2025, the sector was a bit “choppier” than usual these last few weeks. However, Wall Street analysts expect that the artificial intelligence sector will be in full gear in 2025, with a $2 trillion surge in AI-related capital expenditure over the next three years. Moreover, regulatory discussions around AI ethics and safety, spearheaded by global governments, are creating a supportive environment for innovation. "We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI capex (spending) over the next 3 years”. According to Ives, tech stocks are anticipated to rise 25% in 2025 as Wall Street and investors deal with "a less regulatory spiderweb" under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He also believes that stronger artificial intelligence initiatives in the federal government should give the sector a boost. However, there may be "white-knuckle moments" in the year ahead over Federal Reserve decisions, uncertainty over U.S.-China tariffs, and concerns from critics who believe stock valuations are too high. "This will create the opportunities to own the tech theme and key names which has been our core investing tech playbook the last 2 years”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:MDB) provides a general-purpose database platform worldwide that integrates operational, unstructured, and AI-related data to streamline building applications. On December 18, Tigress Financial raised the firm’s price target on MongoDB to $430 from $400 and kept a “Strong Buy” rating on the shares. The analyst told investors in a research note that MongoDB will continue to see growing developer adoption and increasing momentum in its Atlas Database-as-a-Service platform. The Atlas Database-as-a-Service platform is a multi-cloud developer data platform that streamlines how you build with data. This increase is driven by burgeoning AI capabilities as the company continues to capture market share in the most critical and strategic areas of the enterprise software sector. The firm also said that the company’s ongoing AI integration and entry into new industries will lead to greater enterprise adoption, customer penetration, international expansion, and acceleration in Business Performance trends. Overall MDB ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MDB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MDB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) stands against the other organic food and farming stocks. Organic farming practices focus on using natural methods to cultivate crops, avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This approach not only enhances the quality of food but also contributes to preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems. The organic food and farming sector provides economic benefits as well, creating jobs and supporting rural communities. The global organic food and farming industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier and more sustainable food options. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global organic food market was valued at $244.82 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $489.75 billion by the end of the forecast period. This growth is largely driven by increasing awareness of health benefits associated with organic products and a growing concern for environmental sustainability.

This marks an impressive increase of 26.6% or 20.3 million hectares compared to the previous year. Australia continues to lead the world in organic farming area, boasting 53 million hectares, an increase of 17.3 million hectares. The report shows that organic farming area increased across all continents, reflecting a global trend towards more sustainable agricultural practices. In terms of producers, the number of organic farmers worldwide rose to 4.5 million in 2022, which is nearly a 26% increase from 2021.

The United States was the largest market, valued at approximately EUR 56.6 billion, followed by Germany at EUR 15.3 billion and China at EUR 12.4 billion. While some European countries saw a decline in organic sales, Canada and the US experienced growth in retail sales, with increases of 9.7% and 4.4%, respectively.

Morgan Stanley said on Thursday it had decided to leave a UN-backed climate alliance — joining rivals Goldman Sachs and Citi in ditching the group amid conservative backlash toward environmental and diversity initiatives. The Wall Street investment bank gave no reason for its decision to exit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Citigroup and Bank of America said they were leaving the group earlier this week, and Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo made the same announcement in early December. The NZBA declined to comment. In a statement, Morgan Stanley told The Post it is still committed to achieving net-zero financed emissions and will continue to “report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed emissions targets.” A US-based environmental advocacy group urged New York state on Thursday to regulate the financial sector and ensure its policies align with climate goals. “These exits reveal the inadequacy of voluntary commitments and underscore the urgent need for state-level leadership and regulation,” Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY, said in a statement. In November, Texas led a lawsuit of 11 Republican states against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. The states accused the money managers of “conspiring to artificially constrict” the coal market with anticompetitive practices, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a press release. The states alleged the firms built up huge stakes in coal producers and then supported environmental initiatives that lessened coal production to send prices skyward. Republican-led campaigns against environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, which include diversity and inclusion policies, gained steam last year. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck, for example, spearheaded a series of successful boycotts on X to pressure US companies to dissolve their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. Most recently, Nissan Motor announced in December it would roll back its diversity initiatives after “productive conversations” with Starbuck. Other major red-state employers like Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson and Walmart last year axed their diversity initiatives. In a statement, Citi told The Post that it decided to leave the NZBA to focus its attention on the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) as the group undergoes a restructuring. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that GFANZ, an umbrella group for climate alliances, is adjusting how it works with its industry-specific sub-groups after the wave of bank retreats, according to a person familiar with the decision. Companies can now go to GFANZ for guidance on climate initiatives, but they don’t have to pledge to the NZBA, which follows the Paris agreement and its net-zero goals, according to the report. “In light of this shift, and Citi’s progress towards its own net zero goals, we have decided to leave the Net Zero Banking Alliance,” Citi said in a statement. “We remain committed to reaching net zero and continue to be transparent about our progress.” Goldman Sachs, which announced it was quitting the climate initiative in December, said it has made significant progress on its net-zero goals and remains committed to sustainability. “We have the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients,” the bank told The Post in a statement. “Goldman Sachs is also very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world.” Wells Fargo declined to comment on its decision to leave the NZBA, and Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Throughout 2024, Morgan Stanley backed off some of its previous environmental goals. In a report published in September, the bank left out an earlier pledge to remove or reduce 50 million metric tons of plastic waste by 2030. The bank also warned of “unintended consequences” from too quickly taking away financing for high-carbon clients who later plan to decarbonize. Advertisement

Title: ETF Companies Are Racing to Launch the Next ‘Hot’ Crypto Fund

(Bloomberg) -- Purveyors of exchange-traded funds are finding ever more creative — and potentially riskier — ways to lure investors into the crypto craze. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue Detroit’s Michigan Central Is the Building Revival Story of 2024 Burned Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces A Commuting Resolution for 2025: Ride Your Local Subway or Bus Paperwork covering a plethora of newfangled offerings was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as 2024 was ending. Among the proposed products was an ETF from ProShares that would denominate the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Funds planned by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares would offer exposure to convertible bonds issued by companies to buy Bitcoin. And ETF company Volatility Shares envisions getting inverse and leveraged Solana funds off the ground, alongside a vehicle that would track the sixth-largest digital token using futures contracts. “This is the continued evolution of launches to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs. We’ll see a lot of these in 2025,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis. “It’s the hot thing — issuers love to strike when the theme is hot. We’ll see crypto everything.” All in all, the filings, if approved, would bring about more than a dozen new crypto-centric funds to the space in 2025, just a year after the inception of the first-ever US Bitcoin ETFs. 2024 was a banner year for all things crypto, which saw Bitcoin — the world’s largest digital asset — surge more than 120% to cross above $100,000. That boost happened thanks in part to incoming president Donald Trump’s embrace of the industry, with many market-watchers betting that a looser regulatory stance by his administration could help the crypto space grow further. The enthusiasm over his election helped push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF — one by BlackRock — above $37 billion for the year, the third-most of all funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bitcoin fan and MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor also took advantage of surging crypto prices by doubling down on his tactic of purchasing the largest token for the company’s reserves. MicroStrategy has been using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help finance the buying — and other companies have similar plans. According to a filing, the REX ETF intends to invest a majority of its assets in convertible bonds issued by firms that hold Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies, according to paperwork filed last week. “It is rare that a new asset class comes around for the investing masses, and that’s what crypto is now — and Wall Street is always great at creating supply when there is demand,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. “So this is the evolution of the crypto ETF spectrum: futures-based, spot, thematic, and now convertibles, both hyper specific for MicroStrategy and whoever else gets involved in a similar capacity.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Is Not Having a Happy New Year Zyn’s Online Hype Risks Leading to the Nicotine Pouches’ Downfall What Will Elon Musk Do in 2025?

Nick Timoney has agreed a new contract to remain with Ulster until at least 2027 Nick Timoney believes Ulster is the place for him to become “the best I can be” after committing his future with the province until at least 2027. The 29-year-old back-row has signed a two-year contract extension and insists he is ready to be part of a bright future at Ravenhill. Timoney is a key component of Richie Murphy’s squad and delivered a Player of the Match performance last weekend as captain, with Ulster ending a five-game losing run with a 17-7 inter-pro victory over Connacht in Galway. One of Ulster’s longest-serving players having first joined the Ulster Academy in 2015, the former Blackrock College student made his senior debut for the province eight years ago and his full Ireland bow in 2021 against the United States. He has accumulated over 150 caps for Ulster but Timoney isn’t done yet, stating Ravenhill is a place that feels like home to him while expressing his confidence that the side’s new era will be a prosperous one. “I’m delighted to sign a new deal with Ulster,” he said. “I feel very at home here and believe we have the squad to develop and become better in the years ahead. “We have some young talent coming through that adds to our group of experienced players and that is something that both excites and motivates you for the seasons ahead. “I’ve said I want to keep progressing as a player and I fully believe I can become the best I can be here at Ulster.” Ulster General Manager Bryn Cunningham added: “Agreeing terms with Nick before the Christmas period was a high priority for us, and we are delighted that he is fully invested in what we are trying to build here. “Nick is one of the most well-rounded back-row players in Europe and it’s been no surprise to hear about interest in him from other big clubs. “His journey from the Academy, Sevens, to playing for the ‘A’ team and breaking into the senior side has been full of hard work and dedication, and that has helped him develop into the athlete we see today. “He is someone that is a standard-setter to those around him and is a very popular member of the senior squad because of the attitude, commitment and leadership he puts in every week, and he will be a key part of this team’s future.”

Title: Analyst: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Growth Will Be Ahead of Nvidia in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Wall Street Is Focusing on These 10 AI Stocks as New Year Begins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a “big problem” for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips. “If you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) …. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they’re not really AI plays, they’re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They’ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you’re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that’s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,” Niles said. Niles said stocks can face a “rough” time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed. “The Fed finally admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that’s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 James E. Demmert from Main Street Research recently said during a program on Schwab Network that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) surpassed Nvidia in terms of stock performance and it will do the same when it comes to growth in 2025. “I would say Nvidia for just the massive amount of demand that’s been there for their products. But you know, on a stock performance basis as we know Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) just, you know, got up and just took over and really like a turbocharger passed them in stock performance. And I think that says a lot about that, Nvidia’s growth, you know, a lot of it from the hyperscalers is maybe behind it and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) growth may be ahead of it in 25.” What makes Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. However, the company’s revenue growth is expected to slow over the next two years, with estimates suggesting a 22% YoY growth rate, potentially bringing revenues to around $4 billion by fiscal 2026. If Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) can improve margins by 100 basis points annually, it would be able to generate about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income by FY26, with a present value of $1.3 billion when discounted at 8%. Applying an S&P 500-like growth multiple of 2.5 to 2.75 times earnings, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) would have a P/E of 46, translating to a price target of $27, significantly down from its current price of $42. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 10th on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
