From Aurelien by e-mail: She‚Äôs speaking at the moment but it doesn‚Äôt look good. What she did was not unprecedented in the French system (basically moving money around to meet costs elsewhere) but it was done very clumsily, and left a paper trail behind. She also denied everything from the word go, in spite of the evidence, and her defence witnesses were very unconvincing. It just goes to show that the RN is actually a pretty amateurish organisation, with a very limited capability outside Le Pen herself. I don‚Äôt think anyone else is capable of running in 2027. The political consequences are effectively impossible to predict at this stage. From Politico‚Äôs EU morning newsletter: IS LE PEN MIGHTIER THAN THE COURT? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm combative. I won‚Äôt let myself be eliminated,‚Äù a visibly infuriated Marine Le Pen said Monday evening. In her first interview after an embezzlement conviction that leaves her unable to run for office for five years, the far-right icon conspicuously refused to endorse her lieutenant in the National Rally, Jordan Bardella. That was the first sign of where Le Pen‚Äôs head is at as she makes an agonizing choice, as my colleagues Clea Caulcutt and Marion Solletty lay out: ‚Äî Let them eat cake: After painstakingly transforming her father‚Äôs racist party into an electable force, Le Pen was a strong contender to win the French presidency in 2027. So she could boost Bardella to take the top spot on the ticket. ‚Äî Apr√®s Marine, le d√©luge? Or she could dig her heels in and unleash an almighty blitzkrieg, castigating the French justice system with one hand and bringing down the government with the other. Both options come with risks. Bardella is still seen as green (profile here). And so far, the French public seem pretty comfortable with Monday‚Äôs court ruling. An Odoxa poll for Le Figaro published Monday evening found that 54 percent of 995 respondents said they believed her sentence was a sign that France had a healthy democracy. Another 65 percent said they were ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù or ‚Äúindifferent‚Äù to the verdict, Victor Goury-Laffont reports. LIBERAL UNEASE: Yet even among liberal democrats, there was a sense of unease. Sure, this is an affirmation of the rule of law ‚Äî Le Pen was convicted of misusing European Parliament funds for campaign activities, after all. But it‚Äôs not a popular rejection by the demo.

Thirteen years later, Pebbles is still my wife‚Äôs best friend and the little guy walks a mile every day and is so loyal and friendly. He made a good choice. We‚Äôre hoping he lives for many more years. > The siege of Khartoum has lifted. Left behind are scenes of unimaginable horror Wesley‚Äôs List: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran. On a side note, the phrase ‚ÄòEmpire of Chaos‚Äô dates to at least 1814. Not the first time that Khartoum has been under siege and has fallen- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6UfPtyjYQo (4:43 mins) I was lucky enough to visit Khartoum for a wedding fifteen or so years ago (an Establishment British friend married a high society British-Sudanese girl). It was quite an affair (2,000 people in a tent, every man with his stick, three days of celebrations and not a drop to drink‚Ä¶) and the city and country were a wonderful experience. We had to take cash and travellers‚Äô cheques though because the country was cut off from SWIFT and only Diners card worked. As a result, the ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù had long ago stopped paying licence fees to the brand owner but had kept the name. :-) We visited the pyramids at Meroe (now controlled by warlords); we spent afternoons in the fabulous National Museum (now looted); we saw the Sufi‚Äôs whirling in Omdurman (now a horror scene along with Khartoum). It was a well ordered, proud, dignified society that had made the best of a thin hand after it threw off colonial rule. The destruction of Sudan by Great Power meddling is a great crime. That sounds like an amazing experience. I knew a few cyclists who managed to cycle through the country back before it was ruined ‚Äì they said that in all of Africa they had never experienced such hospitality, and they always felt safe. I was immediately struck by this headline. But the reason was that I could no longer imagine any horrors that were ‚Äúunimaginable.‚Äù As I read on this was confirmed, the horrors sounded all too familiar. For example: ‚Äú‚Ä¶They recount a siege of theft and murder, as a trigger-happy RSF militia shot those who resisted their demands. Afraid to carry their dead to graveyards, people buried those killed in shallow graves in their own streets and back yards. Elsewhere, corpses have been left to decompose where they fell. Widespread sexual violence against the civilian population has been reported from the early days of the war. It is an indication of the total siege that Khartoum was under that there isn‚Äôt yet a reliable estimate of the death toll.‚Äù For ‚ÄúRSF‚Äù substitute ‚ÄúIDF,‚Äù and for ‚ÄúKhartoum‚Äù substitute ‚ÄúGaza.‚Äù As Clark‚Äôs list suggests, we could play this game all day. There‚Äôs no shortage of such scenes. Far from being ‚Äúunimaginable,‚Äù we have to fight to keep from being numb to them. I‚Äôve been in Khartoum a number of times for professional reasons, and whilst I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs my favourite African country, I was always well looked after and the people are very hospitable. The Sudanese are an also a proud people and I remember being taken around the National Museum, and being told that the Sudanese had pyramids when the Egyptians were in short trousers. They were also proud of never being an Arab colony, but adopting Islam voluntarily because it had a well-developed system of commercial law. But the problem is a regime that has kept power by force (with a brutality comparable with we‚Äôve seen in recent days) and cynically instrumentalised Islam as a way of controlling the population. It was always argued that the regime‚Äôs practice of subcontracting security to militias in distant areas of the country would backfire, and now it has. With regards to your quote on news about Marine LePen, i was wondering that OK, RN schemes were clumsily done and left a trail, but, what if in other cases there are similar trails to be followed but those aren‚Äôt followed because there is less interest in doing the same with ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù parties. The orders could be ‚Äúfocus please only on parties deemed as menaces‚Äù no matter what you find. Just as a possibility. Re: Honey bee collapse. I am a bee keeper myself and a pretty big one as hobby keepers go. It is the same story like with bird flu. You have completely unnatural conditions that result in bad immunity that result in enhanced disease. Nobody looks at the underlying conditions and ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù ‚Äúveterinarians‚Äù a.s.o. look for some magic solution. Some basics: bees in nature stay in one place and then collect nektar, pollen a.s.o. from plants that offer the bees sustenance at various times of spring into the summer. All that in a natural order. First bloom the cherries, then the apples and at the end the chestnut trees. On top there are hundreds of different flowers, scrubs a.s.o. Each plant offers something slightly different to the bees. In sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year. After the first half of the year you take away the larger part of honey and substitute it with sugar. That is how small beekeepers work all over the world. Big commercial bee keepers move from one mass flowering to the next. For instance canola to almonds. As you have mono cultures you can¬¥t leave the bees in place. In an almond grove there would be no other food but the nektar from almonds and after the bloom bees would simply starve to death. And as the almonds groves are so massive in California you must get the bees from out of state. So commercial bee keepers need to truck their bees over hundreds and thousands of miles. From the above you can see that it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from ‚Äúlesser‚Äù plants that in nature would supply part of their food. All that is apart from all the pesticides and fungicides that are in use in intensive agriculture. Just as you won¬¥t get rid of bird flu in chicken concentration camps you will also never have healthy bees under such circumstances. There is no other option but to dial back the industrialisation of agriculture. Except it won¬¥t happen unless there¬¥s a catastrophy. Seems like we are heading that way. As with bird flu ‚Äì in order not to be forced to look at the whole picture ‚Äì they will try ever new band aids and find ever new ‚Äúreasons‚Äù for the sudden problems. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it is completely unnatural and furthermore bees lack all the pollen and nektar from ‚Äúlesser‚Äù plants that in nature would supply part of their food.‚Äù Interestingly it‚Äôs also how we‚Äôre harming ourselves with highly processed foods. Lack of the right mix of foods to support good gut health and lack of vital micro nutrients that never make it through the processing of the food ingredients. Almonds have really been a disaster cloaked initially by being so damn profitable, which only encouraged everybody and their mother to plant ever more of the jackrabbit of food bearing trees (some varieties will get you a commercial crop after only 4 years) to the point where there are more almond trees in Cali than there are citizens in the USA, and every last one of them needs pollinators. Then the wholesale price went from $4.50 to a buck fifty a pound, and growers are going b/k all over the place, but not before playing a huge part in the destruction of our bee population in the USA. Bees there-done that ‚ÄúIn sum what they collect in barely half a year will get them through the second half of the year.‚Äù Wasn‚Äôt there also the practice in traditional agriculture to have some late-flowering plants (e.g. ivy) around to enable bees to forage in Autumn? In the traditional agriculture in my yard, I have plants that bloom from early spring (crocus) to late fall (aster) with the intention that there will always be something around for the bees. I do plant a vegetable garden too, and I have gotten in the habit of letting at least some of my broccoli go to flower. The bees really like the yellow blossoms in the fall since they are one of the few flowers around in our area at that time. Didn‚Äôt this happen also in the early 2000s? I remember a save the bees campaign back then with predictions of a crop apocalypse. What happened, why no apocalypse that time? It was Neonicotinoids then I believe Support your local beekeepers. I have had an at least one serving per day honey habit for years. My local sources include one beekeeper who sells at the farmers market in MA and another from an activist beekeeper up north in VT. I also have a jar of Oacaxa honey (very intense) for special occasions. (A long time ago in college I worked at the usda bee culture lab in Madison. Which is where I learned to out honey in burns.) Nice to hear that you buy honey local. In fact the honey will be in sync with nature around you and with you as well. Also ask your local bee keeper to give you some propolis and some wax. Propolis helps against all kind of ailments and it is not difficult to make your own tincture and ointment once you have the above. Big pharma doesn¬¥t like propolis ointments (acting through the FDA) but you can make your own. The farmers market here starts again in about three weeks. I will ask. Thanks. To the extent that people in cities, towns and suburbs spend some of their disposable income on ‚Äúartisanal‚Äù food from relatively nearby, to just that extent will little zones of artisanal and ‚Äúartisindustrial‚Äù agriculture survive right near those centers of customer spending on less-industrial food. And pay cash if you can. Many commercial beekeepers treat bees like slave labourers, starve them, destroy their social behaviours, overcrowd them and infest them with pests, and then are shocked ‚Äì Shocked! ‚Äì they die in droves. And expect people to pity them and compensate them for their losses. Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam!

A military base used by the USA but technically controlled by the UK (we can ignore Mauritius‚Äôs claims) with essentially no civilian population who might be hit (there was an encampment of some unlucky migrants who washed up in a boat years ago but they were recently removed). It‚Äôs the perfect target for a demonstration of strength. Or do the UK and USA see this and encourage it? Has the USA moved all its B2 bombers there to tempt Iran into doing something it can use as an excuse for USA and Israeli escalation? They certainly didn‚Äôt move them there to bomb Iran. Those aren‚Äôt fighting bombers, they‚Äôre for trading etc‚Ä¶. Another western own-goal‚Ä¶.in that the US is/will be using B-2s over Yemen as apparently the US Navy can‚Äôt park a carrier off the coast of Yemen (as the US did in 1967 off of Vietnam) without using all of its anti-air ammo. B-2s have a finite, expensive lifespan before needing lots of maintenance. Billions of dollars of capital, operating at millions of dollars per hour‚Ä¶all to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù a military operated by a country that is not even recognized by 100% of the countries around the world. Team Trump is continuing Team Biden‚Äôs strategy of (a) ‚Äúdoing something‚Äù and kicking the can down the road is better than (b) sitting at a table and hashing out an agreement that might be incrementally negative for Israel. Someone should show Trump a map. Maybe leave it on his Oval Office desk. On this map, Yemen is labeled in big red letters ‚ÄúMini Vietnam‚Äù Iran ‚ÄúBig Vietnam‚Äù Ukraine ‚ÄúBig Mama Vietnam‚Äù and China-Taiwan ‚ÄúBig Daddy Vietnam‚Äù. GOP = MAGA held by the puppet strings of ‚ÄúI stand with Zion‚Äù‚Ä¶. even Trump can‚Äôt grasp that Diego Garcia plays a prominent role in Twilight‚Äôs Last Gleaning, JM Greer‚Äôs all too plausible story of how the American empire finally comes crashing down Remember that part of the book well. The Chinese take Diego Garcia in a well planned raid but that was in response to the US bombing a Chinese mainland air base to teach them a lesson. Yeah, and events in the non-fiction world are proceeding unnervingly like they do in the book. Doesn‚Äôt take much imagination to see an aircraft carrier washed up on a beach somewhere. The story ends on a rather hopeful note ‚Äì won‚Äôt give it away, but it‚Äôs not the worst possible outcome, not by a long shot I found that ending to be very hopeful as well. But to think that it all started because the US tried to smash & grab an African country so that they steal their newly discovered oil. Can‚Äôt imagine where Greer got that idea I just watched the movie ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äôs Last Gleaming,‚Äù 1977, with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark. Perhaps there‚Äôs a different movie of the same name but the one I saw doesn‚Äôt seem to match up with comments like ‚ÄúAmerican empire finally comes crashing down..‚Äù In the movie I saw Lancaster convinced the president played by Charles During to admit to the public the reason for the Viet Nam war. In the end Durning, Lancaster, and his cohorts are all shot down to prevent the public from knowing the truth. I found it heartening that in 1977 a producer had the balls to air such truth in public. Not that it did much good. The ending where the president is gunned down and the only one to run to his side was his Aide showed the disdain of all the rest of his advisors and cabinet members for his desire to speak the truth. I imagine this bears some element of truth about presidential politics even today. It also showed that even the president is expendable if he doesn‚Äôt go along with the ‚Äúagenda.‚Äù Our current and future presidents may want to avoid pissing off government and non-government organizations who might wish him (or her) to retire early. ‚ÄòMegatron @Megatron_ron BREAKING: üá∫üá≤üáæüá™ Yemen‚Äôs Houthi have shot down an American MQ-9 ‚ÄòReaper‚Äô drone above the city of Marib‚Äô By their own count, this is the sixteenth MQ-9 Reaper Drone that they have shot down. At about $30 million a pop, you are talking about nearly half a billion dollars worth of Reapers turned to ash. Start cranking all the other associated costs and now you are talking well north of half a billion bucks. If they can do this, then it is only a matter of time until they get a luck hit on a Navy ship in the Red Sea. So what will Trump do then? Rage that he will unleash hell or some such? Offer to make a deal? If he can‚Äôt break tiny Yemen, than what makes him think that he can do so to Iran? Stephanie Kelton to debate Steve Moore April 16th, she gonna eat his lunch and snacks! Colorado River Water disappearing. Here I thought it was over-appropriation and use by humans. It‚Äôs the damned headwaters biomes! Blame the ecosystem, NOT the humans! I saw that too. All that freeloading, parasitic vegetation sucking up all that water which could used for almonds farms or whatever. I got an idea. They should spray Agent Orange all over that region and kill off all that lazy, unproductive vegetation so that all that water will have the freedom to flow unhindered to the Colorado river. Problem solved! An idea that Trump himself could be proud of. They‚Äôve tried that already, the Mekong River. So, the Colorado ‚Äúdeforestation‚Äù campaign will be the Beta test? (Do they have Marmot Cong in Colorado?) Water is for lying over/Whiskey is for lying under: dept. The difference from Cali water and Colorado River water, is the latter allows for so much potential pilfering compared to the relatively short delivery span of aqua here-less chances of chicanery. Trump should impose tariffs on those free loading plants. Because it will make him feel better without actually doing harm to anyone or thing. It‚Äôs almost all orchards here in the southern San Joaquin Valley, and farmers & local officials of the far right persuasion refer to the pines that get first dibs on water in the higher climes as: ‚ÄòStraws‚Äô I can just imagine those orchard owners looking up to all those pines while fingering a cigarette lighter in their pocket. There are an estimated 129 million dead trees in CA that are no longer water straws. But they are ready to burn. I remember reading that there is great concern that CA will have the most massive wildfire, ever, in the Sierra Nevada. Methinks the number is closer to 200 million newlydeads in the Sierra Nevada, and the 129 million number is from the 2012-16 drought. In the earlier epoch rarely did a pine above 7,500 feet succumb to the bark beetles, now its closer to a 9,000 foot ceiling for the die-off. It‚Äôs my contention that Bill Gates stays awake at night fretting about all those birds sleeping for free in his trees. The man really hates Nature.

Legal update: CFPB spared, for now: https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5220651-federal-judge-trump-cfpb/ A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from effectively dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an early target of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson barred the administration from stopping work and firing employees at the CFPB and ordered the reinstatement of previously terminated workers. She also blocked the destruction of any CFPB records and ordered the recission (sic) of any ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù contract cancellations issued on or after Feb. 11. However, USAID has met its fate. An Appeals court lifted a lower court‚Äôs TRO restraining and held that the Trump admin and Elon may proceed feeding it headfirst into the wood-chipper. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that social-media posts like Musk‚Äôs declaration that he ‚Äúfed USAID into the wood chipper‚Äù didn‚Äôt legally prove he was making the orders. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/appeals-court-clears-way-for-doge-to-keep-operating-at-usaid/ar-AA1BRPGO Musk is feeding more than the agency into the wood chipper: The axing of some 10,000 programs has consigned untold numbers of children and refugees to death, officials say. https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-usaid-rubio-marocco-canceled-programs-gaza-syria-congo-hiv-ebola Are we 100% sure that all those programs are what they seem? USAID is a front for the CIA after all. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna While I‚Äôm not a fan of the chainsaw budget cutting, he might inadvertently be doing a lot of people a favor. Of course we can‚Äôt possibly be 100% sure. Is it 100% certain that the Guardian article is true? It‚Äôs clear, though, that the humanitarian programs exist and are crucial to the health and survival of many people around the world in poor countries, even if the CIA is involved in some cases. This is according to media reports, the UN, multiple private aid agencies, government officials, etc. Pretty sure these are actual programs that help people: S. Africa: USAID cuts could prompt over 500,000 HIV deaths https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-usaid-cuts-could-prompt-over-500000-hiv-deaths/a-71777420 and https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-trump-funding-pause-500-million-food-spoilage-risk/ ‚ÄúUSAID plays a major role in coordinating earthquake assistance.‚Äù https://www.reuters.com/world/us/state-department-notified-congress-intent-reorganize-usaid-rubio-says-2025-03-28/ There are many more examples. I doubt the CIA is involved in all of them. Why couldn‚Äôt the aid have been continued de-coupled from any spook activities? Axing all of them at once is unconscionable. But, Musk obviously doesn‚Äôt care about that and scored political points by doing so. It was probably the humanitarian programs in particular which upset Musk. I must admit to quite a bit of schadenfreude watching Musk whine about vandalism on his lots on Fox‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Five‚Äù this afternoon. Poor baby after taking a chainsaw to the lives of thousands. Otherwise, things are getting biblical. The SSA change that ends using phones for making changes to one‚Äôs SS account quickly became, in some news circles, a decree that all SS recipients come into the offices that are still open to prove their identity. Made it seem all Christmassy to me: ‚ÄúAnd it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world‚Ä¶‚Äù Then to satisfy my curiosity about the UK‚Äôs breakdown, I watched this fellow get interviewed by the same hard right British ‚Äúchannel‚Äù as interviewed the frightening young fellow I linked several days ago. This guy, who was a Tory and UKIP member of Parliament for more than a decade, says that ‚Äúbeing born in a stable doesn‚Äôt make you a horse.‚Äù He proposes that Britain should ‚Äúremigrate‚Äù up to the second generation of descendants of immigrants back to the countries where their ancestors came from. In other words, if your grandpa came from Jamaica, even if legally, back you go. But this Mr. Carswell offers his advice not from a post in not-so-merry old England but from the American state of Mississippi where he is the CEO of some non-profit funded by somebody who shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to have money. So when I heard Carswell advocate for returning the first and second generation of British descendants of immigrants, legal or illegal, this sprung to mind: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me Crazy times. ‚ÄúTrump to Unveil Country-Based Tariffs April 2 in Rose Garden‚Äù Of course the whole thing is a shakedown. He is putting a tariff on every country that there is but I think that the real reason is so that he can extract economic concessions from them. I think that there are two or three demands that the Trump regime is making of Oz. One is to get rid of our PBS subsidized drugs so that Big Pharma can make big profits here like in the US but that is absolutely the third rail in Oz politics. Another is stranger. There is an attack on our Goods & Services tax here in Oz. In short, you buy something or pay for a service here, you have to pay a tax on it. The US is crying that it is an unfair tax but many States in the US do exactly that- https://theconversation.com/is-australias-gst-a-tax-or-a-tariff-and-why-has-it-become-a-target-in-the-trade-wars-250041 I think that the problem is that the US buys more from Oz than Oz buys from the US and Trump is upset by that. But there is a solution. The biggest export to the US by a country mile is gold which is why the imbalance. So I propose that we stop selling gold to the US. Immediately the deficit will run the other way, Trump is happy and I am pretty sure that Oz can find another country to sell our gold to. Anybody know the telephone area code for Beijing? AI is ‚Äúrunning out of juice‚Äù (The Register) https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/14/ai_running_out_of_juice/ If you look closely at what Microsoft has been doing with AI, you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs pulling back in places some of us wouldn‚Äôt think to look. Microsoft has canceled more than a gigawatt of datacenter operations in addition to numerous 100-plus MW agreements. I‚Äôm old enough to remember when the ‚ÄúJuice‚Äù ran for 2003 yards, breaking Jim Brown‚Äôs NFL rushing record in the old Shea Stadium. Maybe AI must bring back ‚Äúthe Juice‚Äù for the man in the street? Regarding the ruckus about the USA moving airforce assets to Diego Garcia: ‚ÄúThe media and some readers argued that Iran might not be able to reach Diego Garcia. Iran is signaling otherwise.‚Äù There is another hypothesis: those B2 & co bombers are not there to attack Iran, but to subdue Yemen. I agree with that hypothesis. I already commented here that I believe the USA first has to crush Yemen if a joint Israel-USA attack against Iran is really to take place: having Ansarallah capable of wreaking havoc in the rear is something that must be excluded for such an offensive to have any chance of success (and even then). The massive bombardments that are now taking place against Yemen (several dozens of attacks daily) show that the focus is on eliminating Ansarallah as a player able to lob missiles and drones at Israeli and American ships and bases in the region. If and when this is achieved, then the USA will be able to proceed with Iran. I see Iran has three Kilo-class submarine. Can you imagine what would happen if after the US launched an attack against Iran, that one of them surfaced near Diego Garcia and lobbed a few missiles into the airbase just as those planes were getting ready to land again? Just sink (or debilitate) US Navy oilers in random corners of the world. The US only has so many. even losing one makes things more complicated The US military has a logistical chain built on playdoh Not sure the Iranian Kilo boats have missile capability? RE: The Code That Controls Your Money I notice that it is written by someone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC (paraphrasing): I can no longer see any way for a human to progress without harming another Which resonated then, and booms emptily more these days. a natural consequence of having 8+ billion people on the planet, and the politically incorrect observation that certain jurisdictions have 0, or negative, non-migration population growth while others don‚Äôt. PS, I hate the Club of Rome and their intellectual heirs I think that is a bit of a stretch, we (as a species) are bearing the consequences of earlier globalisations, destabilising previously stable populations. Do you enjoy being historically incorrect as much as politically? ‚Äúsomeone called Clive, perhaps the same one who, a fair while ago, said on NC‚Äù I doubt it. The article states that Clive Thompson is a journalist who writes about science and technology and as far as I can remember, NakedCapitalism commentator Clive was a software engineer, not a journalist. Since the article talks about COBOL, let me add a few points. 1) Learning COBOL ‚Äî or most other programming languages ‚Äî is not that difficult. While this is the first obstacle to having programmers able to deal with those legacy systems, the other software components and libraries that those COBOL programs rely upon constitute a really big hurdle. I bet that many of those banking/financial/insurance COBOL programs make use of the services of such software systems as CICS and IMS ‚Äî IBM technology from the 1960s to deal with transactions and databases. Yes, IBM is still maintaining all of it. This is something that is often forgotten: learning a programming language is not enough; one must be knowledgeable with a large set of external libraries, additional software components, and ancillary services to develop or maintain anything of value. This does not just affect COBOL; the situation is the same with modern programming languages (for instance, since they are mentioned in the article, Java, Python, JavaScript). 2) By the mid-1980s, development had moved from programming individual COBOL statements that invoke those auxiliary libraries and modules explicitly, to embedding some higher-level descriptions or instructions in the COBOL program that would then be processed and automatically transformed into the necessary COBOL code. For instance, one would insert a (properly tagged) SQL statement that would then be replaced by the necessary COBOL calls to the database management system. This was possible not just for database functions, but also for user interfaces, report writers, communications, etc. So when reading about the sheer amount of existing COBOL code, remember that a large fraction of it is not hand-coded, but automatically generated from other formalisms (at least from the late 1980s onwards). 3) Ah, the infamous ‚ÄúGOTO‚Äù! Two things: first, it is ‚ÄúGO TO‚Äù in COBOL, not ‚ÄúGOTO‚Äù. Second, the real killer in COBOL is the ‚ÄúALTER‚Äù statement. I will not explain it, but suffices to say that our teacher of COBOL refused to explain its semantics, telling us to never use it, and that one of my colleagues once joked about making use of one such statement to make life ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù for future maintainers of the application he was developing. Disclaimer: I learned COBOL at the University, and developed in COBOL in the mid-1980s. What I remember is the hierarchy between application programmers and systems programmers. The systems guys were the high priests needed to make things work ‚Äî they knew the inner workings of the OS. In my DoD days we had Ada as the language that would incorporate all the best software engineering ideas. Problem was it was competing with the private sector C and then C++/C# with OOA/OOP concepts and while DoD was important, thanks to the mini/micro revolution it wasn‚Äôt big enough to command things. Agree that much of the problem is a system engineering one. Interfacing systems, understanding and implementing APIs, testing interoperability. I guess Rust is coming on as the language de jour, with JSON and REST getting a lot of the web interfacing chores. Much respect, thanks for this comment. I was employed for about 5 years writing Javascript in my mid-30s back when the WWW was fairly new, after failing Comp Sci 101 in the 80s with punchcards. But I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the history of computing. ‚ÄúGermany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war‚Äù This could get interesting. I can just see the next general NATO meeting now and where the German representative stands up and says- ‚ÄòOK now. Just for the official record. So you want Germany to build up our military into a powerful force once more.‚Äô Lots of nods. ‚ÄòThen you want German tank armies to go charging across the plains of Poland.‚Äô More nods from the other NATO members. ‚ÄòThen you want the German army fighting the Russians in front of the gates of Moscow.‚Äô Yet more nods. ‚ÄòAnd nobody sees a problem with any of this.‚Äô The other NATO members then shake their heads.

But don‚Äôt worry, we can have them do a full 360 in a flash. AB: Thanks for the reassurance. Do you think you could lend us a few attack helicopters. I read you bought a bunch of those recently too. RS: Sorry, no. AB: Are you still planning to do a joint build with South Korea of fighter jets in Poland? RS: Sorry, can‚Äôt discuss that. Do you need some old MIG‚Äôs? AB: No, I hate anything Russian. RS: Well, at least we have that in common. Good luck. But isn‚Äôt there also a history of Germany forcing overthrow of the Russian government followed by civil war?

Now that more working class and middle class families find their earners trapped in the gig economy, they are beginning to rely on food banks rather than making donations to them. And when the middle class feel the bite of hunger and the threat of permanent impoverishment for their offspring, that‚Äôs when the need for real political reform takes shape in their minds and they take the first faltering steps towards reality. I think we are reaching the position where Farage will make a real breakthrough and Reform becomes a broad enough church to win the next election. It might be a good idea to have a government relying on a parliamentary majority consisting of people with little or no political experience who have become politicians out of necessity because they‚Äôve given up hope in the existing order and not because it is a good career choice for someone on the make. But as with other countries in Europe, will the British establishment allow new politicians into power or find creative ways to block them? ‚ÄúTaiwan accuses Chinese chipmakers of illegally poaching engineers‚Äù Maybe that story is not so simple. Maybe those Taiwanese bosses told some of their engineers that they have a new assignment for them. That they will be sent to the US to go work in setting up a new chipmaking foundry there. And those engineers sat down after work in a bar sharing their thoughts. Working and living in America would be a great experience. Doing the same in Trump America may be not so much. Even Canadians are avoiding traveling there and the number of ways that you can fall afoul of law enforcement/ICE/FBI, etc. is legion. On the other hand they can actually see China from their office windows. You could work there and see family every weekend. They talk the same language and have the same customs. For any Taiwanese engineer that would be a great temptation and it is not like Taiwan values its workers that much. The headline just seems to conjure images of Chinese poachers, dressed in Ghillie suits, stalking the streets of Taipei and darting unsuspecting engineers with trank guns, then dragging their unconscious forms off to Shanghai. I suppose that even works as a resurrection of the old verb ‚Äúshanghai,‚Äù right?

Now the Republicans in power are going to smack them around a bit. It‚Äôs a cheap giveaway to some of their allies with the bonus of dinging what has become a power base for the Democrats. Perhaps they can keep Harvard going with plasma donations in the i.v. league, er mobile blood donation vans? Unfortunately, I think this is a significant factor. And it‚Äôs nothing new. George Wallace used to slap ‚Äúpointy-headed liberals‚Äù around a lot with much success, and conservatives have been making fun of obscure research projects by academics forever. And liberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped. Many people who do not live their lives in academic bubbles or education-adjacent PMC enclaves do not see the world the same way and will not connect the necessary dots. I was very sympathetic toward that Rutgers Resolution for the Big Ten schools, but I doubt if that would be the case for the broader public. Now if Trump were to slap a 25 percent tariff on football tickets or alumni donations to athletic programs, well that would be a whole new ball game ‚Äì so to speak. (See, I can‚Äôt even keep myself from being condescending!) Not a fan of ‚Äúliberal condescension toward the deplorables‚Äù but having been born in the Heartland and moved to the coastal cities as an adult I find the crying about condescension to be hypocritical at best. Mostly it seems like projection. Much like the GOP cries of ‚Äúgroomers‚Äù when every week another is busted for worse. Anecdotal but the only times I‚Äôve ever had a gun pointed at me were by the NYPD (lived in a latino neighborhood and police raids were common) and in the heartland by a guy who didn‚Äôt like my ‚Äúfruity‚Äù look. Also while in Texas on a film production had a local in a cowboy hat and AR-15 graphic t-shirt threaten to ‚Äúkick my Hollywood p-ssy -ss‚Äù for enforcing on-set mask mandates back in 2020. I could list numerous other examples of Heartland values I‚Äôve experienced that 25+ years of NYC/LA living have avoided but won‚Äôt for brevity. I‚Äôll just say that I‚Äôve lived in city neighborhoods often deemed dangerous yet have never had threats or issues in these places like I have experienced in small town America. So, for some of us, not seeing ‚Äúthe world the same way‚Äù is why we prefer the very flawed world view of coastal elites. Yeah, I got turned down for a job because they didn‚Äôt want to hire a cis white guy (was surprised they actually said that!) but they‚Äôve never pulled a gun or threatened to beat me. Every so often I scroll through the threads on Truth Social, Rumble, and Gettr to get a glimpse of the conservative cultural landscape. Similarly will browse Bluesky and Mastadon for liberal ones. The liberal platforms are very PMC Russia-gate delusions of being one lawsuit and Sorkin speech away from mimosa brunch utopia. The conservative ones are a descent into violent civil war fantasies, gun fetishists, replacement theory rantings, and dreams of putting women back in their place. Both are crazy but only one is wishing for a new Crusades. Personally, as a person and an artist, I try to find ways to bridge divides and wish that was a more common approach. So, yeah, maybe ‚Äúliberal condescension toward the deplorables has not helped‚Äù and maybe wokeness was annoying but back in 1946 Superman was shown punching Klansmen (the original idPol activists) and that was considered a good thing. Now are we supposed to just accept there are ‚Äúgood people on both sides‚Äù because the Heartland might get offended if we say such things are bad? What (if any) critique of so-called small town values is acceptable? Or is ‚Äúthis‚Äù only an acceptable mantra for one side? I have dual citizenship: rural Illinois and west coast port city. In my boonies the condescension is noticed and leaves a mark. President Garber‚Äôs official letter to the Harvard Community. Harvard has $55 billion endowment, more than enough to tell Trump to pound sand. F*cking cowards. Dear Members of the Harvard Community, Earlier today, the federal government‚Äôs task force to combat antisemitism issued a letter putting at risk almost $9 billion in support of research at Harvard and other institutions, including hospitals in our community. If this funding is stopped, it will halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation. The government has informed us that they are considering this action because they are concerned that the University has not fulfilled its obligations to curb and combat antisemitic harassment. We fully embrace the important goal of combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry. Urgent action and deep resolve are needed to address this serious problem that is growing across America and around the world. It is present on our campus. I have experienced antisemitism directly, even while serving as president, and I know how damaging it can be to a student who has come to learn and make friends at a college or university. For the past fifteen months, we have devoted considerable effort to addressing antisemitism. We have strengthened our rules and our approach to disciplining those who violate them. We have enhanced training and education on antisemitism across our campus and introduced measures to support our Jewish community and ensure student safety and security. We have launched programs to promote civil dialogue and respectful disagreement inside and outside the classroom. We have adopted many other reforms, and we will continue to combat antisemitism and to foster a campus culture that includes and supports every member of our community. We still have much work to do. We will engage with members of the federal government‚Äôs task force to combat antisemitism to ensure that they have a full account of the work we have done and the actions we will take going forward to combat antisemitism. We resolve to take the measures that will move Harvard and its vital mission forward while protecting our community and its academic freedom. By doing so, we combat bias and intolerance as we create the conditions that foster the excellence in teaching and research that is at the core of our mission. Much is at stake here. In longstanding partnership with the federal government, we have launched and nurtured pathbreaking research that has made countless people healthier and safer, more curious and more knowledgeable, improving their lives, their communities, and our world. But we are not perfect. Antisemitism is a critical problem that we must and will continue to address. As an institution and as a community, we acknowledge our shortcomings, pursue needed change, and build stronger bonds that enable all to thrive. Our commitment to these ends‚Äîand to the teaching and research at the heart of our University‚Äîwill not waver. Sincerely, Alan M. Garber Cowards indeed. They should have stood up on the hind legs when the slavering Elise Stefanik went after the college presidents. And that was when Biden was president, and I don‚Äôt remember that he objected to it at all. And not many other Democrats either. And from the letter, you can see that these universities have bought in 100% to the new definition of ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù.

And tariff everyone on top of that. ‚Äòvitrupo @vitrupo Instead of learning how to code, Replit CEO Amjad Masad says ‚Äúlearn how to think, learn how to break down problems, learn how to communicate clearly.‚Äù Is there an accreditation for this? Asking for a PMC friend. And this guy is actually going to put his trust in AI generated code? OK then. What could possibly go wrong? I guess that makes sense; Replit is all about live coding environments; LLMs doing the coding for you means more customers for him and his service. Thailand Says Collapsed Bangkok Tower Used Substandard Steel Bloomberg. The latest news I‚Äôve seen is that four senior staff of the Chinese company that was the main construction partner have been arrested for (allegedly) trying to remove records from the site. I doubt if this could have been caused by substandard steel, even if it was used. A quick google indicates that the construction of the tower has been very troubled, with lots of delays. This can be highly problematic in building construction as there can be break in the ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô trail due to changes in staff/contractors after an unplanned pause, and if a building is left exposed you can have unexpected deterioration in structural fittings that were never intended to be exposed to the elements. For example, concrete has been laid, its very difficult to test if it was done correctly in the first place, and a pressurised sub-contractor may just assume that it had been done to legal standards by the previous contractor. As one engineer who had a business fixing concrete rot once said to me ‚Äì ‚Äòa good paper trail is not a guarantee of good concrete‚Äô. But it could have been just bad luck with timing, depending on the construction design. The basic frame may have been in place before stressing cross-braces were put in place, or the foundation may still have been open to allow ground works, before everything was concreted over. For the most part, most building codes apply to the finished building, not an interim structure (I confess to knowing zero about Thai construction codes, except that they are much weaker than most western countries, but substantially better than most poorer Asian countries). Construction here is not very good. Air conditioners do not have filters. Toilets do not have traps. Many tall-ish buildings do not have steel frames (there is a term of art, which I forget, but one floor is built on pillars, and then the next floor is built on top of that). And that‚Äôs before getting to the ability to make payments to smooth bureaucratic obstacles. Reinforced concrete framing, otherwise known as ‚ÄúPancake Stacks.‚Äù We have a lot of reinforced concrete framing here in Uruguay, but we don‚Äôt have earthquakes. I really don‚Äôt think that the structures themselves are deficient, but that they tend to pancake during earthquakes. I remember the freeway that pancaked in San Francisco in the World series earthquake of 1989, Loma Prieta lazy load-bearing walls and earthquakes don‚Äôt mix‚Ä¶.and it‚Äôs unfortunate that, like many parts of Asia and other parts of the world, the local authorities can‚Äôt codify safe practices which literally arose from the body count of early-industrial age (see Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire) Article mentions ‚Äústeel bars‚Äù suggesting rebar, but maybe this is a translation thing and it‚Äôs structural steel forms. Reminds me of the 1031 Canal (Hard Rock Hotel) collapse in New Orleans in 2019 (I was there at the time). Seems like the design was fingered as the culprit. Or the FIU bridge collapse where the construction team changed the design without going back to the designers. I‚Äôve been wading through Marc Andreesen‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechno optimists Manifesto‚Äù, Nick Land‚Äôs ‚ÄúDark Enlightenment‚Äù and some of ‚ÄúMencius Moldbug‚Äôs‚Äù writings. Their plan seems to have three parts. !) Destroy American Civil Society. 2) After a period of Civil unrest and Martial law which will ‚ÄúRight Size‚Äù the population, impose the Technate. 3) Paradise! I have few doubts that the first part will succeed, it is well underway and I see little opposition to date. The assumption that Civil unrest and ‚ÄúRight sizing‚Äù the population is going to be controllable seems unrealistic. And the assumption that our Techlords will be the only ones attempting to fill that political vacuum seems to ignore groups such as the Mormon Church, which is a State within the State. There are others‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIf everything goes as planned‚Äù ignores the fact that Murphy always shows up at the party, invited or not. It won‚Äôt be boring. No kidding. These geniuses (genii?) possessing neither a drop of empathy nor any understanding of how humans work really think they can make this happen. Sure, they‚Äôll just impose themselves on the populace whether the rabble likes it or not. They seriously can‚Äôt conceive of anyone opposing the gift of enlightenment they would bring. Certainly not any churches, organized crime groups, unions, militias (right, left and non-partisan), ethnic communities, rural communities, National Guard units who remained loyal to their states, etc. As someone said the other day, I‚Äôve never seen a successful oligarchy with this many unemployed snipers around. They‚Äôll learn too late why we went to the trouble to build civil society in the first place. It‚Äôs like ol‚Äô Mencius was too busy trying on leather jackets for his photo ops to pick up a book on the Thirty Years War (which loomed large in the minds of the founders, I can assure everyone). Oh well, like you say ‚Äì interesting times ahead. (Thanks for letting me vent!) US Military returning home might have a different take on things, despite its very corrupted higher eschelons‚Ä¶ Dang, I don‚Äôt see many April fools jokes, unless I‚Äôm fooled. Fool me, let‚Äôs go. at least I found one, Ian Proud link above Here you go. Enjoy. https://www.idcommunism.com/2025/04/russia-after-95-years-on-public-display-lenins-body-will-be-laid-to-rest-in-ulyanovsk.html Here is probably the best one I have run across today. If you look at the title of the very first podcast in the list. The eyebrow-raiser ‚Äì Dr. Ehrman actually was very much involved in the presentation of The Gospel of Judas to the public twenty or so years ago, and that was anything but a hoax. So, there is some ring of credibility there which made the joke all the more gripping. If you are interested, the entire podcast from today‚Äôs April Fool‚Äôs festivities was all about the most important hoaxes and forgeries of gospels and other Christian documents. It was actually quite enlightening. Just FYI, I have been reading and studying the Ancient Greek and Latin for decades. All of the ancient classical library of Greece and Rome and all of the Christian documents. Dr. Ehrman, of Duke University, an avowed atheist, is by far and away the best teacher and study guide for those interested in the koine Greek Christian canon. I always leave his lectures with more questions than answers. https://www.bartehrman.com/podcast/ An oldie but a goodie. A lot of people believed this was a true story at the time, including other news outlets not noticing it was in the April 1st edition of Sports Illustrated. / ;) https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/10/15/curious-case-sidd-finch via RACKET Another good doc-video on protest, by Ford Fischer / News2Share Protesters face off outside Tesla dealerships nationwide over Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚ÄúDOGE‚Äù 15 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdkWwS4OE-0 The problem: If this is First Amendment the First Amendment is a joke. It¬¥s a worthless token offered to the protest rabble to give them the feeling that they actually can do something. Which they can¬¥t. In fact it¬¥s an expression as it is a cover for and of total and utter powerlessness. Everyone doing some idiotic thing in public apparently invokes the First. The First provides the right to be a moron. Wow. Very helpful. That¬¥s almost like protest against ‚Äúthe right‚Äù in Germany. Completely worthless. I doubt these people would be protesting in front of BMW or GM. Though those companies do not cause less destruction on the planet. Or of course take any multi. They say Musk. But they ought to say capitalism. But capitalism has again become the sacred cow of Jane and John Doe. Long live the First International. Oh? Is that why govt worked/works so hard to silence certain voices and threads via NGO cutout organizations? Because the 1st is a joke? Riiight‚Ä¶. I am all in for the First. And I am abhorred over what is going on in Germany (the only case I can judge). And I will always defend it. BUT: The fact that there is free speech ‚Äì whatever its limits in Europe e.g. ‚Äì what¬¥s it worth? Did it stop us from inching towards WWIII? Does it stop a genocide committed as openly as ever? Does free speech stop the destruction of free speech on campuses in the US? Will it stop the destruction of labour via AI? Will it stop the increased concentration of capital? Will it stop climate ‚Äúchange‚Äù? I do for instance believe labour unions can achieve a few of these things. But when labour will in fact endanger the ruling order it will clash violently with state and corporate power. I.e. that labour will have to act well beyond the rights granted by free speech and arm itself. In the face of material force free speech in itself is worthless. That¬¥s what facsism means. When free speech does threaten ruling power only on the surface you already can see what happens. They will use a tiny bit of judicial force to stop it. What if you push further? What if all BSW-voters in Germany had gone to the street and would have demanded a recount of the votes? What if protesters storm the US nuclear storage at B√ºchel base in Germany? Freedom of speech ‚Äì or lets say diplomacy ‚Äì did not help the Russians in preempting a war with 1.3M KIA on both sides. As Capone says in THE UNTOUCHABLES ‚ÄúWith a gun and a nice word you achieve more than just a nice word.‚Äù What is free speech worth if we dare not question the capitalist structure underneath it? What is free speech worth if we have no means to enforce it against the state? What is free speech worth if the people who have the means to push for political change are so brain-washed that they in fact support the above mentioned WWIII policies or a genocide. Naturally this is a polemic comment and I am putting forward talking points which I still do not believe but I must contend with current realities. It is also a very personal reaction to the political fallout which we have experienced since 2024 in particular. As the necessity to resist couldn¬¥t be more obvious. But never have we been further away from a viable political opposition with the Left ‚Äì that usually held up that option ‚Äì completely in tatters, or better, paid off. I am not argueing that we have completely run out of options with the use of free speech rights. But right now I am pessimistic it will in fact change anything beyond the cosmetic level. p.s. In his latest podcast Doug Henwood had two regulars as guests to his show. They spoke about the PMC. Henwood being Henwood I need not go into further detail. But there was this one point: The guests suggested that one reason for a possible demise of the genuine left originating in the 1960s was the idea of many academics then to change the system from the inside and decided to enter the system ‚Äì after ‚Äì and this is the interesting part ‚Äì coming to the conclusion that the protest did not seriously end Vietnam but changes within the system did. I don¬¥t know about the evidence for that. It¬¥s complicated to prove any such point. Much of it being smart PR by pseudo-leftists I would suspect. I have all my life been in favour of protest. And I have always been of the opinion that protest (i.e. the First) did end Vietnam. But comments like this make me think. Especially if a Daniel Ellsberg 2 years ago mused that may be it was not the protest that brought down Nixon, not his own Pentagon Paper leaks and not a seminal SCOTUS decision ‚ÄúNYT & Co vs. US‚Äù ‚Äì but a Howard Dean. Howard Dean, or John Dean? ‚ÄúOf course John Dean. What did you think. I was only testing you.‚Äù Shit. Thanks. Sorry. I seem to like making these slips‚Ä¶ and it¬¥s not the first time with Dean. And I really don¬¥t know why. My memory of Howard Dean is very murky. Mine too!! Poor guy. He didn¬¥t deserve it, did he? I do believe he opposed Iraq. p.s. Who among D.C.s big shots today opposed Iraq??? (AOC I assume wasn¬¥t even born, so she¬¥s lucky and excused.) Yes, I‚Äôm sure he did. Obama sure didn‚Äôt. He wasn‚Äôt that great on Universal Health care for everyone though I did work for him at the time.It was an optimistic campaign. Re: Iran will target Chagos ‚ÄúWhen the time comes, it won‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre an American, British, or Turkish soldier ‚Äì you will be targeted if your base is used by Americans.‚Äù Uh oh! Goodbye Al Udeid! We won‚Äôt miss you! Prosecutors directed to seek death penalty against UnitedHealthcare killing suspect Luigi Mangione AP ‚ÄúLuigi Mangione‚Äôs murder of Brian Thompson ‚Äî an innocent man and father of two young children ‚Äî was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,‚Äù Bondi said in a statement. ‚ÄúAfter careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump‚Äôs agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.‚Äù And thus are Martyrs made. ‚ÄúBrian Thompson‚Äîan innocent man‚Äù Only because he was never charged for his crimes. The wealthy sins and mistakes, which all need forgiveness, while the poor have crimes and sins, which are unforgivable and require punishment. Money really does wash away one‚Äôs guilt.

And they couldn‚Äôt even cover their tracks? Amateurs, mere amateurs. Sigh. There is a lot to say and the case is still developing. But French law is pretty strict on the financing of political parties, and there have been a number of similar prosecutions in recent years. Former President Sarkozy, already convicted of fiddling election expenses, is on trial for receiving campaign contributions from Libya amounting to millions of Euros, at least. But the point here is not the crime (which is pretty well established) but the punishment. The judge had a great deal of discretion in the punishment awarded, and opted for the harshest available: disqualification with immediate effect, even while an appeal is being mounted. That means that Le Pen cannot present herself in 2027, it means that the party itself probably won‚Äôt be able to find another candidate, and that the whole complexion of French politics has just been altered by one judge who could easily have awarded a sentence that was less harsh. Not everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence. >‚ÄùNot everybody is happy about one judge having so much power and influence.‚Äù Which does confirm a Walter Kirn (sorry to bother with him who is no expert on foreign affairs) who I have criticized just yesterday for alluding to this very problem. I cross-posted this with yesterdays article on not accepting or sending checks for US taxes‚Ä¶ Holy mackerel! I was reviewing the US Treasury‚Äôs Daily Statement trying to get a picture of tax inflows from tariffs from a before perspective. While I was reviewing it I came across 2 line items that when viewed together shocked me‚Ä¶ (fiscal year to date numbers)‚Ä¶ inflows/deposits to the Treasury‚Ä¶ Taxes ‚Äì Non Withheld Ind/SECA Electronic $164,358M Taxes ‚Äì Non Withheld Ind/SECA Other $126,061M These line items relate to taxes paid by individuals that were not withheld from payroll or collected in advance for other reasons‚Ä¶ the money owed after you complete your return if you did not receive a refund. While I‚Äôm not 100% confident I have identified the best/fullest answer, but from what I‚Äôve been able to glean the difference between Electronic and Other is tied to whether you filed your return electronically of via paper where ‚ÄúOther‚Äù is primarily paper filed returns. I‚Äôd suspect they call it Other because it likely also includes legal judgements regardless of your original type of filing. While it is technically possible to file on paper and pay electronically via the IRS web portal, I would highly suspect the correlation is that paper filings include a paper check! At least at the dollar level, the ratio is 1 : .75. That‚Äôs a lot of paper checks (or their dollar equivalent) to force to electronic payment in the next 6 months or so! While I do suspect some of those paper returns & checks are very high dollar value, I still think it directionally points to a significant volume of people who are paying their taxes in paper check form (or equivalent such as a money order). Don‚Äôt know, but like lots of people without W-2 income or mandatory 1099 withholding I make estimated tax payment by check throughout the year. I did notice my 15 Jan check processed by Cincinnati came back as ‚Äúconverted to ACH‚Äù. Think that‚Äôs a first. Hope Hawaii doesn‚Äôt jump on this bandwagon. We pay some business taxes. They keep raising the tax so for one period we got fined for exceeding the dollar limit where you have to file electronically. So now we file electronically but the limit for mandatory electronic payment is higher (and with ‚Äúconvenience fee‚Äù) so we still pay by check. Had a three-month span where we were getting dinged for non-payment. Had to call and fax copies of the cleared checks (thankfully, not converted to ACH so you can still get an image of front/back of actual check). No, I‚Äôm not going to Zelle my IRS payment. re: Germany vs. Gaza Germany Turns to U.S. Playbook: Deportations Target Gaza War Protesters Objections from a top immigration official that none of the protesters were convicted of crimes were overruled amid political pressure. https://theintercept.com/2025/03/31/germany-gaza-protesters-deport/ A question for the commentariat: What are the power centers in the America of today?

Finance, Wall St, Silicon Valley, the MIC, the Ports, Energy, Ballot Box re: Le Pen JACOBIN Stopping Marine Le Pen From Running Is a Bad Idea By David Broder Marine Le Pen has been banned from running for office for five years. The sentence applies the law as written, but it turns her embezzlement conviction into a propaganda coup for her party. https://jacobin.com/2025/03/marine-le-pen-embezzlement-propaganda The thrust is obvious but there is also at least this bit: ‚Äú(‚Ä¶) But banning candidates from running for office due to financial crimes is highly dubious.

Title: As Future of Panama Canal Hangs in Balance, Mexico Quietly Begins Testing Its Interoceanic Rail Corridor
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/04/as-future-of-panama-canal-hangs-in-balance-mexico-quietly-inaugurates-its-interoceanic-rail-corridor.html
Time Published: 2025-04-01T10:53:15Z
Full Content:
South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai just became the first company to use the rail corridor, which is being touted as a possible plan B to the embattled canal. Just a few weeks ago, the Trump Administration was celebrating what seemed to be an early strategic victory over China in the US‚Äô direct neighbourhood. As readers may recall, a consortium led by the investment fund manager BlackRock had just announced its purchase of 80 percent of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison‚Äôs port holdings, giving the consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, including, crucially, the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal. The sale of CK Hutchison‚Äôs ports business put ‚Äúthe ports [in Panama] under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane,‚Äù noted an Associated Press article. The message was clear: the Trump Administration is not going to stand by and watch as China expands its influence in the US‚Äôs own ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù, especially over strategic assets like the Panama Canal. To put this in broader context, the attempted buy out of the Panamanian ports came just three months after the opening of the Chinese-financed and -managed deep sea port in Chancay, which as Asia Times reported, signalled ‚Äúthe start of a new era of efficient, high-capacity shipping between China and Peru, with a connection to Brazil across the Andes.‚Äù As a measure of Chancay‚Äôs importance to the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping even travelled to Peru to inaugurate the mega port (as well as attend the 31st APEC Economic Leaders‚Äô Meeting held in Lima), where he said: ‚ÄúWe are witnessing not only the solid and successful joint implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative in Peru, but also the birth of a new land-maritime corridor between Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean in a new era.‚Äù Of course, this caused all sort of teeth gnashing in Washington, especially given that Chancay is more advanced than any seaport in the US. Within weeks, US officials were signing a strategic agreement with Ecuador‚Äôs Daniel Noboa government that allows the US to install military personnel, weapons and other equipment on the Galapagos islands, a UNESCO Natural Heritage Site in a country whose constitution expressly prohibits the establishment of foreign military bases. The island chain is 1,900 kms from Chancay. Since its inauguration, Trump 2.0 has upped the stakes, showing a clear willingness to use every conceivable tactic, including gangster extortion, to stymie Chinese influence on the American continent, particularly in Mexico and Central America. As Conor recently reported, the Trump administration‚Äôs obsession with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure extends beyond the American continent: Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. ‚ÄúSelling Out‚Äù the Chinese People Against this complex backdrop, the BlackRock-led consortium‚Äôs purchase of CK Hutchison‚Äôs port holdings (outside of China and Hong Kong) was set to be consummated with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction by April 2 ‚Äî that is, tomorrow. But that, alas, will not be happening, at least not any time soon, since Beijing has decided that it, too, can play dirty on the global chessboard. Last week, China‚Äôs State Administration for Market Regulation said it plans to ‚Äúreview [the sale] in accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest‚Äù. As the FT reports, the move came on the back of earlier commentary in the Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, that called the sale a ‚Äúspineless, grovelling‚Äù move that ‚Äúsells out all Chinese people‚Äù. The agreement ‚Äúin principle‚Äù was announced in early March, with a formal signing of the Panama ports transaction expected by April 2. However, this is now set to be delayed, according to two people familiar with the matter. Yesterday, the newspaper featured comments from Hong Kong politicians and Chinese lawyers urging the CK Hutchison to rethink the sale of its ports division, which is kind of ironic given that the main point of the sale was to ‚Äúde-risk‚Äù its port holdings. Now, it is caught in the middle of a bitch fight between the world‚Äôs two superpowers, for which it has already paid a heavy price. Since news of Beijing‚Äôs objections to the sale broke on March 13, the company‚Äôs shares have fallen 13%, retracing more than half of the 25% gain after the deal‚Äôs announcement. One Ta Kung Pao editorial even suggested that the sale could contravene Hong Kong‚Äôs national security laws, known as Article 23. If, as the FT notes, the deal were ultimately blocked, it could have major repercussions not only for Beijing‚Äôs already troubled relations with Hong Kong‚Äôs business elite but also Hong Kong‚Äôs reputation as a global financial centre: CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong‚Äôs richest man Li Ka-shing and his family, has increasingly been caught between Beijing and Washington over the Panama ports since US President Donald Trump complained of Chinese influence over the canal and said the US would be ‚Äútaking it back‚Äù. It is unusual for a Chinese state agency to review a deal involving a Hong Kong-based company. CK Hutchison‚Äôs holding company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the conglomerate‚Äôs ports in China are excluded from the sale. ‚ÄúIs this a warning shot to others or a look to scuttle this deal?‚Äù one person familiar with the deal said. ‚ÄúOn paper, the SAMR reviewing how this deal affects the Chinese shipping industry under its anti-monopoly mandate makes a lot of sense. But does anyone really believe that or is this . . . the Chinese scuttling a deal which will then have ramifications on Hong Kong as a financial centre?‚Äù ‚ÄúTorpedoing the deal . . . would send shockwaves all around the financial world,‚Äù said Josh Lipsky, senior director at the Atlantic Council‚Äôs GeoEconomics Center and a former adviser at the IMF. ‚ÄúThe risks are so high for all involved.‚Äù The End of the Belt-and-Road in Panama The deal represented a triumph for the Trump Administration‚Äôs geostrategic aspirations in its own neighbourhood as well as a blow to China‚Äôs belt-and-road project, given that some 6% of global trade passes through the canal. According to the US International Trade Commission, the Canal ‚Äúhas 46% of the total market share of containers moving from Northeast Asia to the East Coast of the United States.‚Äù Panama itself was the first country in Latin America to join China‚Äôs Belt-and-Road initiative, in 2017. However, the Panamanian President Jos√© Ra√∫l Mulino, under pressure from US Sec of State Marco Rubio, recently said he would withdraw Panama‚Äôs Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review. The CK Hutchison deal was also supposed to mark a major milestone for BlackRock‚Äôs global infrastructure ambitions. According to Bloomberg, Fink had personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The billionaire CEO reportedly boasted of BlackRock‚Äôs deep links with governments worldwide, stating, ‚ÄúWe are increasingly the first call‚Äù. But apparently not in Beijing. For Trump, the deal was all about ‚Äúreclaiming‚Äù the canal for the United States ‚Äî a message that, perhaps unsurprisingly, has not gone down well in Panama. This is a country wearily accustomed to US military interventions, the last of which took place in 1989 with George H W Bush‚Äôs invasion and toppling of Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama‚Äôs strong arm dictator (1983-9) and former CIA asset and go-between during the US‚Äô dirty wars in Central America. Much like Saddam Hussein a few years later, Noriega thought he could go his own way. Trump has repeatedly denounced that US ships pay exorbitant prices to transit the waterway, though they, in fact, pay the same rates as ships of any other flag. But the deal is now on ice anyway, meaning that other options, including military ones, are back on the table. US-Style ‚ÄúPartnering‚Äù With Panama Even before Chinese regulators put the stick in the spokes, the Trump Administration had already directed the US military to draw up plans to increase the American troop presence in Panama, according to information leaked to NBC. As the NBC article notes, the amount of military force used will depend on the extent to which Panama is willing to, ahem, ‚Äúpartner‚Äù with the US: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops‚Äô seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration‚Äôs goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China‚Äôs influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Trump seems to believe that the US has, at the very least, joint, if not full, ownership rights over the canal due to the fact that the US government and banks financed its construction between 1904 and 1914. What happened just before 1904 is often forgotten or overlooked, however. The veteran US journalist Ken Silverstein jogged a few memories in his 2014 article for Vice, : ‚ÄúIn 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia into handing over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them JP Morgan & Co, which was appointed as the country‚Äôs ‚Äòfiscal agent‚Äô in charge of managing $10m in aid that the US had rushed down to the new nation.‚Äù US interests were myriad: on the one hand, Washington wanted access to, and control over, the canal that French builders had begun but failed to finish in the 1880s. At the same time, Wall Street banks were keen to create a new nation that would primarily serve their interests. As John Pilger reported for The Guardian in 2016, it was JP Morgan that would lead the American banks in gradually transforming Panama into ‚Äúa financial centre ‚Äì and a haven for tax evasion and money laundering ‚Äì as well as a passage for shipping.‚Äù Washington maintained control of the interoceanic waterway until 1977 during which time when then-US President Jimmy Carter signed with the then Panamanian leader, Omar Torrijos, the cession of US control of the facility 22 years later. The agreement came after years of protests in Panama against US occupation but was widely criticised by US conservatives at the time and is seen by Trump as a ‚Äúserious mistake.‚Äù But the Panama Canal has lost some of its lustre since the jungle country suffered an unprecedented drought in 2023. As we noted a few weeks ago, the BlackRock-led consortium‚Äôs participation in the canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama‚Äôs ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). As Tom Neuburger wrote in a Jan 2024 article we cross-posted here, the plans to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the Canal sound like plans to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the climate: Bill Gates-style high tech fantasies. [Bloomberg] ‚ÄúIn the long term, the primary solution to chronic water shortages will be to dam up the Indio River and then drill a tunnel through a mountain to pipe fresh water 8 kilometers (5 miles) into Lake Gat√∫n, the canal‚Äôs main reservoir.‚Äù That‚Äôs a $2 billion project if it comes in on budget. But is it a long-term fix? Bloomberg admits that Panama ‚Äúwill need to dam even more rivers to guarantee water through the end of the century.‚Äù Sounds like Band-Aids to me. Lots of them. And residents of the to-be-flooded land are vigorously opposed, so it will be a political fight to move them. ‚ÄúAnother potential fix is decidedly more experimental ‚Ä¶ cloud seeding, the process of implanting large salt particles into clouds to boost the condensation that creates rain.‚Äù The article is not optimistic that this will work. Another Gatesian dream: Pretty. Impossible. Or to say that differently, pretty impossible. Plan B Option: Mexico? As the future of the Panama Canal hangs in the balance, Mexico has begun pilot testing the Interoceanic Rail Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (also known by its Spanish initials, CIIT). On Friday, a ship chartered by the Hyundai Motor Company docked at the Pacific port of Salina Cruz in Oaxaca. Its cargo, 600 Hyundai vehicles, were unloaded and placed on a freight train that then set off across the Isthmus, Mexico‚Äôs narrowest land bridge, to the port of Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, where the cargo was loaded onto another boat destined for the US‚Äô East Coast. And just like that, the first genuine rival route, or perhaps better put, complementary route, to the Panama Canal was born. Or perhaps better put, reborn. You see, most of the infrastructure for the project was built over a century ago. In fact, the 188-mile railroad joining the two main ports was opened in 1907, seven years before the inauguration of the Panama Canal, and within no time was plying as many as 60 trains a day carrying things like sugar from the Caribbean on their way to the US West Coast. But its success was short lived. When the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the railroads were increasingly used to transport weapons and troops rather than freight. Four years later, the Panama Canal opened, offering a more attractive route to international businesses. Gradually, over time Mexico‚Äôs interoceanic railroad system fell into disrepair, and while recent governments in Mexico have talked about rebooting the system, it wasn‚Äôt until Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador (aka AMLO) took power in 2018 that the words actually turned into action. As we reported in September 2023, if completed and done well, it will probably represent the most important infrastructure project of Lop√©z Obrador‚Äôs presidency. The goal is not just to turn Mexico into a logistics powerhouse but also to spread wealth across the country by boosting economic opportunities in Mexico‚Äôs poorer, long-neglected southern states (Oaxaca, Veracruz, Tabasco, etc). This will largely be through the development of ten industrial parks, or so-called ‚Äúfree zones‚Äù, along the route. The project will also include the construction of four new highways, three airports, a gas pipeline and a fibre-optic network, and already boasts a ten-stop passenger train service. As the problems stack up in Panama, other interoceanic land routes are coming under consideration, including a rival canal in neighbouring Nicaragua, which almost got built instead of the Panama Canal at the turn of the 20th century, as well as interoceanic rail corridors in Honduras and Colombia. But for the moment Mexico‚Äôs CIIT has one clear advantage over all these other projects: it is close to completion, and that is largely thanks to all the work undertaken in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ‚ÄúAn Exceptional Project‚Äù While the journey time of the CIIT (6-7 hours) is slightly shorter than the Panama Canal (8-10 hours), you also have to add in the time it takes to load and unload thousands of shipping containers off a ship onto a train and then back on to a ship at the other end. According to a video report by the Wall Street Journal in September last year, ‚ÄúMexico still has a lot of work to do to get its ports ready for a large influx of cargo‚Äù. This was a point that President Sheinbaum herself addressed in her Monday morning press conference: ‚ÄúSeveral very important cranes are about to arrive. There will also be a storage facility for grains that is also important, and other actions to strengthen the port of Salina Cruz and that will allow freer movement. It is an exceptional project that provides an alternative to the Panama Canal, and when the port of Salina Cruz is complete, it will have much more activity.‚Äù The total transit time for the Hyundai cargo was around 72 hours, according to local sources. Granted, this was the first pilot test carried out with a large cargo of vehicles but it still compares unfavourably with the Panama Canal ‚Äî unless of course one takes into account the possible waiting times for ships before passage through the canal, which during periods of low rain can mean days or even weeks of hanging around off Panama‚Äôs coastline. During the 2023 drought, waiting times reached as long as 14 days, leaving some carriers little choice but to bid millions in extra fees to jump the line. Another advantage of the CIIT for a shipment from, say, South Korea to New York is that you wouldn‚Äôt have to go all the way down to Panama, navigate the canal and then go all the way back up again. Also, the long-term goal of Mexico‚Äôs interoceanic rail corridor is to bring the journey time down to low double or even single-digit figures as the logistics systems at the two ports gain in efficiency. According to the WSJ report, it should ultimately take around 15 hours for cargos to pass through Mexico. But as Mexican journalist Agust√≠n Garc√≠a Villa notes, the success of a project of this scale and grandeur will require many things, including a trained workforce, technology, super-rapid processing of containers at the ports (which is good for all businesses, including, of course, drug trafficking ones), reliable energy sources, and the development of properly urbanised mid-sized cities that guarantee an adequate supply of housing, schools, hospitals, health centres, energy and markets. It will also depend on the amount of security Mexico‚Äôs marines can provide to the strategic infrastructure. All of that, in turn, will require a steady flow of significant investment as well as long-term political commitment. The former is, for the moment, amply covered, with money coming in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. Put simply, big business, not just from the US, wants this project to happen. So, too, does the Claudia Sheinbaum government, which took over the reins of power from AMLO last October. Ultimately, as the WSJ report concludes, Mexico‚Äôs re-emerging interoceanic rail corridor is unlikely to rival Panama Canal in terms of capacity or speed of transit even once complete. But it could serve as a very useful complement. As Doctor Yasmine Sabri, associate professor of logistics at University College London, tells the WSJ, rather than competing with each other, perhaps the two could work together by sharing data, enabling them to reroute vessels whenever there is a chokepoint, whether it is in Panama or Mexico. However, big questions still remain. For instance, how much opposition will the construction of industrial parks in Oaxaca and Veracruz face from local indigenous communities? If there is strong resistance, how will the Sheinbaum government respond? Like AMLO before her, Sheinbaum prides herself on representing indigenous rights and voices. It also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project as and when it gradually comes on line. Of course, Trump will have somewhat more difficulty bullying Mexico into submission than it did Panama, but it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention. Will Chinese companies be interested in investing in the industrial parks along the route, as it has done in so many other infrastructure projects in southern Mexico? Much will depend on whether Mexico continues to serve as a point of entry for competitively priced manufactured goods into the US market, which cannot be taken for granted. Of course, Washington will try to talk Mexico out of accepting any offers of Chinese funds. Mexico, like Panama, finds itself caught in a tussle between two apex superpowers, and is already paying a heavy price. US pressure to impose equivalent tariffs on Chinese goods continues to rise. To assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam. If the Trump administration does try to impose its will on Mexico‚Äôs re-emerging trade route as it has tried to do with the Panama Canal, so far unsuccessfully, it will heap even further pressure on the rapidly fracturing global trade system. And if this goes on for long enough, global trade volumes will ultimately begin to fall, perhaps even obviating the need for so many transoceanic trade routes in the first place. ‚ÄúIt also remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the CIIT project‚Ä¶it can still pull some pretty large levers, including, of course, tariffs and the threat of military intervention.‚Äù I recall seeing a report somewhere that five guys in a boat were seen leaving the Baltic Sea and heading south into the Atlantic Ocean, carrying several strange tall objects about the height of ICBM‚Äôs as cargo. But to what ends is Trump trying to control China? The majority of the ships through the Panama Canal go to the US. Many go from east to west coast of the US. Some from Europe to west coast, others Asia to east coast. And since the US is a major importer, any shutting of the canal/ports would hurt the US more than China. While he might not care, I‚Äôm not so sure the vast majority of Americans won‚Äôt. The rail would allow the largest MGX-24 (24,000 TEU) to dock. As they are way to big for the canal. From what can find a fully automated port can load/empty 24k in 12 hrs. I wonder how the costs of doing this is vs the cost of the canal transit and adding many days of waiting time? Well, it seems unlikely that the port will be as well run under BlackRock (who will be incentivized to run it down and then dump the mess on the US govt) than under its current CHinese management. See what BlackRock and its ilk have done to US health care and so many other industries ‚Äì maximize profit, enshitify service, skip maintenance. It‚Äôs an interesting project and more so because it is an updated 19th century scheme. It will never replace the canal but that is not it‚Äôs intent. I can see it being used to ship cargo on a reliable timetable which is no longer true of the Panama canal due to problems with water supplies declining which the canal needs to operate. You know what might be interesting? If China came in and built a high-speed rail running parallel the the cargo railway to connect up all those communities in that corridor. Thanks for the great report. It may be time to consider whether the defeat of the last administration was a blow to hegemony‚Äìthe ‚Äúblob‚Äù‚Äìor has brought us hegemony on steroids as embodied in one very flawed personality and his increasingly sycophantic staff. So far hegemony 2 consists of the considerable hot air that comes out of Trump‚Äôs mouth but should he indeed start a war with Iran, or even Panama, it will be the American people who will also suffer as we join Netanyahu in the rogue nation category. The public tolerated and even applauded ‚Äúwe‚Äôre an empire now‚Äù under the Bush Jr. regime but then had considerable buyer‚Äôs remorse as Iraq and Afghanistan turned sour and endless. The Dems got it wrong about Trump who is nothing like Hitler but may be very much like the foolish Kaiser Wilhelm with his obsession with his costumes and inferiority complex. The adults running Trump‚Äôs many would be targets need to assert themselves and seem to be doing so. Moon suggests a walkback of Trump‚Äôs unhinged Sunday rant toward Putin https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/03/russigates-role-in-trump-putin-relations.html So is it another ‚Äú360‚Äù by the Donald? Or is he merely willing to be reasonable with nuclear armed Russia but not all those ‚Äúshitty little countries‚Äù as he called them like Yemen and Panama? Is it still kick down/suck up? The psychodrama is getting old fast. If you‚Äôre ever in Panama City, I urge you to visit the Canal Museum. Quietly‚Äìmovingly‚Äìit underscores the incredible racism that underlay the canal‚Äôs construction, beginning to end, the 27,000-plus deaths that came with it. The entire world thinks that Panama runs the canal better than we did and the Panamanian people (including my students there during the summer of ‚Äô23) are proud of the fact. Incidents like the murder of 22 students who wanted to fly their country‚Äôs flag at Balboa High School in the Canal Zone in 1964‚Äìnot to mention the flattening, with more than 200 completely unnecessary deaths, of the poor Panama City El Chorillo neighborhood during our invasion‚Äìare not forgotten. We forget how hard it is to invade and hold a country. We will find out once more if we choose to go into places like Iran or Panama. Very rough math: For a 20,000 TEU (assume max container ship) = 20,000 TEUs / 250 TEUs per train = 80 trains to move containers from coast to coast. For a 5,000 car Ro-Ro, 12 cars per autorack, 417 autorack rail cars, so about 4.5 trains. Loading/unloading autoracks/Ro-Ro is much faster than loading containers too, maybe about 24 hours turnaround. So it looks to me like it‚Äôs feasible for autos and probably bulk, but perhaps not for containers and intermodal? I guess i am behind the curve. ‚ÄúTo assuage US demands, the Mexican Iron and Steel Industry Chamber has even called for the Sheinbaum government to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in order to prevent Chinese steel imports from entering Mexico via TPP signatory nations such as Malaysia and Vietnam.‚Äù But i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place. Wasn‚Äôt Obambam excluding China from the TPP when he was in office? Then Hillary finally came out against the TPP at the end of her campaign? ‚ÄúBut i thought the TPP was about excluding China in the first place.‚Äù My guess is that Chinese steel enters Malaysia and Vietnam through the already deep trade ties Beijing has with these countries, and then some of that steel ends up heading towards Mexico under the preferential conditions of the TPP. The economist Robert E Scott warned about this happening wrt the US in an article for the Economic Policy Institute in late 2016, just months before Trump walked away from the deal. Here‚Äôs the intro: President Obama has built his closing case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a political argument, saying ‚Äú‚Ä¶we can‚Äôt let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. We should write those rules.‚Äù But it is both arrogant and wrong to think that the United States has the power to shape the rules governing China‚Äôs relationship to TPP signatories. As of today, China has already established deeper trade ties than the United States with the TPP nations. Further, congressional approval of the TPP would actually lock in those advantages for China. China has a large trade surplus with the TPP countries, and crucial terms of the agreement (specifically weak rules of origin (ROO) requirements, which we‚Äôll talk about in detail below) would provide a back-door guarantee for China and other non-TPP members to duty-free access to U.S. and other TPP markets. Thanks Nick Vera Cruz is the starting point for past invasions of Mexico (Cortes, re the Conquest & General Scot re Mexico _US treaty of Gaudalupe Hidalgo). In 1900, work started on the Kansas City, Mexico , and Orient Railway (now El Chepe in Mexico across the Copper Canyon) which was to connect the US to the Pacific. The advantage of the Mexican connecection is that if the land transit times are short and if the offloading/loading logistics are efficient, then Pacific (Asia) -Mexico boats could carry loads a shorter direction in both directions. Like wise , boats leaving Vera Cruz could consolidate their Pacific cargo for points towards the Atlantic , etc. Also, in November Nicarauga President Ortega proposed to China to build a Atlantic/Pacific Canal through that country. The Panama Canal is not without its difficulties. Be careful what you wish for, if the US ‚Äòreclaims‚Äô, it gets to service the operation, etc. Don‚Äôt understand the importance of Balboa and Cristobal (container I assume?) ports to cross-canal shipping? Have some interest as my father was stationed in Coco Solo during WWII as a flying boat engine mechanic. He also deployed with a detachment from his squadron to the Galapagos Islands which was used as a flying boat logistics center (in the last half of the war Japanese subs were considered the primary threat). So its not like a US base in Galapagos is something new (Army Air Force also had a bomber base there). From the Galapagos Conservancy: The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 enhanced the strategic importance of the Galapagos Islands as a potential refueling station for trans-oceanic transport. In 1911, the US suggested a 99-year lease of the islands in return for US$15 million. Later, the US and Ecuador discussed the rental or purchase of San Crist√≥bal, or of the whole archipelago. With the advent of the Second World War, the strategic significance of Galapagos grew, and, in 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and with concern about Japanese actions in East Asia, the US approached Ecuador with the idea of establishing a US airbase on Baltra Island to protect the Panama Canal. At the end of 1941, US forces arrived from the Panama Canal Zone. In 1942, the US Sixth Air Force constructed the air base which was to have important long-term consequences for the islands. In 1943, this base was home to 2,474 US officers and men and 750 civilian laborers; as such, this was the largest colonization of the islands to that date. In 1941, the civilian population of the Galapagos Islands was 810 people. The arrival of so many people increased the demand for water, fish, and agricultural products, and threw a lifeline to the people eking out a livelihood on the islands. Base crews constructed a water pipeline from the highlands to Wreck Bay, in San Crist√≥bal, and used barges to transport water to Baltra Island. The availability of water in Wreck Bay made San Crist√≥bal more attractive to immigration and meant that people could move down to live in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. The greatest legacy was the construction of the first land-based airport in the islands‚Äînow modernized to serve as the main entry point for most travelers to the Galapagos Islands. The US closed the air base in 1946; residents dismantled the structures left behind, using the components to build many of the early houses in Puerto Ayora and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. Also, in 2023, over a year before Trump 2.0 took power, the head of the US Southern Command, Laura Richardson, underscored the Chinese presence in critical infrastructure in Latin America as a threat to US national security and hence the importance of maritime dominance to counter it. She highlighted the presence of five Chinese companies along the Panama Canal and the strategic value of the new port in Chancay, Peru. Your email address will not be published.

Full Content:
BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, says that the US dollar risks losing its dominance to Bitcoin, a sentiment shared by political heavyweights like Senator Cynthia Lummis. We take a look at how pro-crypto assertions like these could help rally the market and fuel new crypto projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL). ‚ÄòIf the US doesn‚Äôt get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,‚Äô Fink stated in his annual letter to investors. The letter touched upon several core problems that plague US society today, including the average American‚Äôs poor financial literacy and the need to democratize investments. Fink warned that Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature and gradual public adoption over the years could soon threaten the supremacy of the US dollar: The solution to the US‚Äôs current financial and economic problems, Fink believes, can be found in digital assets because ‚Äòtokenization is democratization‚Äô and Bitcoin leads the way. That these statements come from BlackRock lends even more weight, knowing that the company‚Äôs trademark iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF holds over 570K $BTC, worth over $48B. Furthermore, Blackrock‚Äôs BUIDL fund has received a series of $USDC inflows, with the latest valued at $7M, for a total of $33M over the past three days. If tokenization is the future, Blackrock is already there. Staunch crypto advocate, Senator Lummis echoes Fink‚Äôs views on X. After announcing the Bitcoin Act back in July 2024, meant to increase the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs Bitcoin pool to over $1M, she clapped back at Congress yesterday for not passing the Act fast enough. She then pressed the gas pedal one post later with a blunt: ‚ÄòSay it with me: Pass the BITCOIN Act.‚Äô in response to Fink‚Äôs statements. The signs are clear: no matter how bearish the markets are right now, the crypto sphere is entering an era of unprecedented top-level support and widespread adoption, with $BTC leading the way. In this context, it‚Äôs good to keep an eye on some of the best new crypto that could be part of the next bull run. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new crypto project with ambitions to upgrade Solana‚Äôs ecosystem and deliver lower fees and faster on-chain transactions. The project promises to rectify core problems with Solana‚Äôs current performance, like failed transactions, long downtimes during network outages, and frequent network congestion. As the team achieves its milestones, the devs post regular updates on their work schedule. The latest update focused on their collaboration with Sovereign to achieve faster transaction processing and greater TPS (Transactions per Second). The presale is ongoing, having raised over $28M so far, with the price of $SOLX sitting at $0.00168. This strong early performance makes it one of the best presales in 2025, along with the 142% APY designed to attract stakers and early investors. Tokenomics data: Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the most promising meme coins, thanks to its links to Bitcoin proper. The project attracts investors with long-term $BTC airdrops, each coming at key $BTC price points ($150K, $200K, etc.), and if you hold the tokens in Best Wallet. $BTBULL was born from the idea that $BTC will eventually reach and surpass the $1M market evaluation. As such, the developer team aims to hype up investors to support Bitcoin‚Äôs bull run, in turn, dragging Bitcoin Bull Token along for the ride. The presale has raised $4.3M so far, with the $BTCBULL price sitting at a still super low $0.00244. Staking is at 97% currently, with a staking pool of over 1B. Tokenomics data: OpenSea ($SEA) is the first and biggest NFT marketplace in the game. If you want to buy, sell, and mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art, collectibles, music, virtual property, this is the place to be. The company launched its beta in February of this year and recommends itself as a ‚Äòfully reimagined product‚Äô for NFT collectors and pro investors. It promises to bring several key features, including native cross-chain purchasing, 0% swap fees, and an unmatched collection of different markets. $SEA is set to have its public launch in 2025, but it doesn‚Äôt have an official date yet. Until that happens, you can interact with the OpenSea world right now if you‚Äôre a fan of tokenized art. All three covered above are viable new token projects to keep an eye on as the crypto verse expands. The question isn‚Äôt whether Bitcoin will rally, but when. After all, we live in a universe where financial mammoths like Blackrock and US political figures like Cynthia Lummis are pushing hard for adoption while highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs superiority over USD. Who would‚Äôve believed it back in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published his little 9-page paper, ‚ÄòBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System‚Äô? As always, there‚Äôs no holding back progress.

ByChase Peterson-Withorn ByChase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff. The world‚Äôs billionaires have always been rich and powerful‚Äîbut never more than now. That‚Äôs particularly true in the United States, where Donald Trump was sworn in (again) as America‚Äôs billionaire-in-chief in January. This time around, he‚Äôs giving the billionaire class more control over the government than ever before. His right-hand man is the planet‚Äôs richest person. His administration includes at least ten billionaires and billionaire spouses. And scores of billionaire execs‚Äîfrom Meta‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg to French luxury goods kingpin Bernard Arnault‚Äîhave lined up behind Trump. The billionaire bonanza extends beyond the U.S., however. A record 3,028 people around the globe make Forbes‚Äô annual World‚Äôs Billionaires list this year, 247 more than last year. It‚Äôs the first time the billionaire population has crossed the 3,000 mark. They‚Äôre worth a record $16.1 trillion in all, $2 trillion more than a year ago and more than the GDP of every country in the world besides the U.S. and China. The average fortune now stands at $5.3 billion, up $200 million from 2024. There are now three people worth more than $200 billion for the first time ever, part of the record 15 members of the $100 Billion Club, the elite group at the very top of the list whose net worths span a dozen digits. That‚Äôs up from 14 a year ago and none in 2017. These 15 centibillionaires are worth $2.4 trillion‚Äîmore than the bottom 1,500 billionaires combined. The richest of all is Elon Musk, worth an estimated $342 billion. Despite spending a lot more of his (already divided) time heading DOGE, Trump‚Äôs cost-cutting operation, Musk has added $147 billion to his fortune over the past year, thanks to a blockbuster year for his rocket company SpaceX and his AI firm xAI (which he merged with his social media giant X last week). Even Tesla, despite recent protests and a stock market selloff, is trading higher than a year ago. That‚Äôs allowed Musk to reclaim the title of world‚Äôs richest person from Arnault, and has given him a $126 billion lead over the next richest person: Meta‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $216 billion), who ranks No. 2 for the first time. Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos ($215 billion) ranks No. 3 and Oracle‚Äôs Larry Ellison ($192 billion) ranks fourth. Arnault ($178 billion), meanwhile, slides down to fifth, his lowest rank since 2017, amid a slump in shares of his luxury conglomerate LVMH. Forbes used stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025 for this year‚Äôs ranking. The United States, with a record 902 billionaire citizens, continues to boast more billionaires than anywhere else on the planet. China, with 516 (including Hong Kong), remains second and India, with 205, still ranks third. More than 50% of all listees are citizens of one of these three countries, but altogether 76 nations and two semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire, including Albania for the first time ever. Forbes also added 15 from Saudi Arabia this year, after removing the Kingdom‚Äôs billionaires in 2018 following a government crackdown. In all, 288 fresh faces join the annual Billionaires ranking this year. That includes celebrities such as rockstar Bruce Springsteen ($1.2 billion), movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1.1 billion) and comedian Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion). Also new: controversial crypto kingpin Justin Sun ($8.5 billion), several artificial intelligence tycoons from such companies as Anthropic, CoreWeave and DeepSeek, and the moguls behind several notable food chains: Cava, Chipotle, Jersey Mike‚Äôs and Zaxby‚Äôs. The wealthiest newcomer of all is Marilyn Simons ($31 billion), the widow of hedge fund legend Jim Simons, who died in May 2024. He was one of 32 billionaires who died over the past year. (Another, Israeli industrial titan Stef Wertheimer, died in late March, after we locked in the list, and thus appears in the ranks.) Simons is one of just 406 women among the World‚Äôs Billionaires, only 13.4% of the list, up a hair from 13.3% last year. Nearly three-quarters inherited their fortunes. That includes the world‚Äôs richest woman, Walmart heir Alice Walton ($101 billion), who has overtaken French L‚ÄôOreal heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion) for the top spot among women. Forbes found just 113 self-made women around the globe, the richest of whom is Swiss shipping tycoon Rafaela Aponte-Diamant ($37.7 billion) whose company teamed with BlackRock this year on a plan to buy 43 ports, including two in Panama. Overall, 67% of the list is self-made‚Äîmeaning they founded or cofounded their company or established their own fortune, rather than inheriting it‚Äîup from 66% in 2024. The youngest self-made billionaire is Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang ($2 billion), who is 28. Wang is one of just 21 billionaires who are 30 or younger, including Johannes von Baumbach ($5.4 billion), a 19-year-old heir to a German pharmaceuticals fortune, a newcomer who is now the world‚Äôs youngest billionaire. The oldest billionaire, at age 103, is U.S. insurance tycoon George Joseph ($1.9 billion), one of four listees who have hit the century mark. The average billionaire is 66 years old. Few billionaires have had a better year than Donald Trump‚Äîand not just because he retook the U.S. presidency. Before moving back into the White House, he padded his cash pile with a very lucrative move into crypto. Between that and his Trump Media & Technology Group going public just after Forbes locked in its 2024 rankings, the president‚Äôs net worth has more than doubled, from an estimated $2.3 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion. A small handful of billionaires, relatively speaking, didn‚Äôt fare so well. A total of 107 people who were on the 2024 ranking are simply no longer rich enough to make the cut. Notable drop-offs include Lisa Su, who is the CEO of semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sara Liu, cofounder of embattled server and storage maker Supermicro; and Nicholas Puech, an heir to the Herm√®s luxury goods empire who says his fortune has vanished. The World‚Äôs Billionaires list is a ranking of every person on the planet who Forbes estimated to have a net worth of $1 billion U.S. dollars or more as of March 7, 2025. Some billionaires have gotten richer or poorer in the time since; indeed, Forbes found three more billionaires shortly after locking in this year‚Äôs list and there are likely more out there. Like most of our readers, we‚Äôre also bracing for the impact of tariffs on the global stock market. For daily updated rankings, see Forbes‚Äô Real-Time tracker. When possible, we met with billionaires in person or spoke with them virtually or by phone. We also interviewed their employees, handlers, asset managers and financial advisors, rivals, peers and attorneys. Uncovering their fortunes required us to pore over thousands of Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory documents, court filings, probate records and news articles. We took into account all types of assets: stakes in public and private companies, real estate, art, yachts, planes, ranches, vineyards, jewelry, car collections and more. We factored in known debt and charitable giving. We exclude dispersed family fortunes, though we list wealth belonging to the immediate family of the living founder of a fortune under the founder‚Äôs name. In some cases, we also include wealth held by the immediate family member of an heir. In either of those instances, you‚Äôll see ‚Äú& family‚Äù in a person‚Äôs listing. For the full list of the world‚Äôs 3,028 billionaires, see here.

Title: US Dollar To Lose Reserve Status If Investors View Bitcoin As A Safer Bet ‚Äî BlackRock CEO

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has warned that the U.S. Dollar could lose its reserve status to Bitcoin. This comes on the heels of plunging global financial markets and rising domestic debt. The dollar has faced external pressure in recent months, with many suggesting Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption could pose a slight threat to the currency. In a new letter to investors, Larry Fink expressed concerns over the U.S. dollar‚Äôs dominance. He further highlighted the successes of Bitcoin ETFs and the potential of decentralized finance globally. According to him, the currency has enjoyed dominance for decades but is not a future guarantee. Bitcoin adoption, on the other hand, has grown exponentially in the last decade and could become a global currency if investors see it as a safer bet. Previously, traditional players viewed Bitcoin as high risk, warning clients against gaining exposure to the market. At the moment, institutional investors have increased their crypto exposure amid wider acceptance across several levels. Institutional appetite fueled Bitcoin to a $2 trillion market cap before headwinds hit major assets. The US dollar has been affected by rising debt and increased government spending. While inflation turns investors to other assets, Bitcoin is tipped as a hedge against inflationary trends. ‚ÄúThe national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square‚Äôs debt clock started ticking in 1989. This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn‚Äôt get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.‚Äù The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paved the way for institutional investors and added legitimacy. These funds triggered wider adoption, taking the asset‚Äôs price to new all-time highs. After several products attracted nearly $40 billion in total assets, investors have delved into other crypto ETFs. BlackRock stood out as a major player in the space, with its Bitcoin product igniting other market participants. The firm‚Äôs total ETF arm recorded about $22 billion in net inflows last year. Bitcoin remained crucial as the crypto ETFs dominated narratives in 2024.

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 31, 2025 04:46 PM In response to a question regarding a report that that China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it will review CK Hutchison's potential sale of relevant port assets to a BlackRock-led consortium, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Monday at a prese briefing that he has noted the report that the SAMR will review the deal in accordance with the law, with the aim of protecting market fairness and safeguarding public interests. China's top market regulator said on Friday it will carry out an antitrust review of CK Hutchison's possible Panama Canal ports' deal in accordance with laws to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to the website of the SAMR. Guo said that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying.

June-July could trigger collapse via events like a U.S.-Iran conflict, Treasury default, or CBDC rollout√¢¬Ä¬îurging immediate action to decentralize assets. In a chilling warning on Decentralized TV, investment strategist Chris Sullivan outlined two catastrophic economic collapse scenarios√¢¬Ä¬îhyperinflation from unchecked money printing or a deflationary spiral triggering mass debt defaults. His most alarming revelation? The looming threat of the "Great Taking"√¢¬Ä¬îa global elite scheme to confiscate wealth through centralized financial controls. Sullivan, a seasoned financial expert with decades of experience, urged viewers to "exit fiat√¢¬Ä¬înow" and embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, including Bitcoin, privacy coins, and precious metals. His insights reveal that institutional investors are already hedging against systemic failure by quietly moving into crypto, while stablecoins like Tether could become lifelines if traditional banking collapses. The Two Economic Doomsday Scenarios Sullivan warned that the U.S. dollar system faces two potential death spirals: Hyperinflation √¢¬Ä¬ì The Federal Reserve√¢¬Ä¬ôs endless money printing could render the dollar worthless, mirroring Weimar Germany or modern-day Venezuela. Deflationary Collapse √¢¬Ä¬ì A debt implosion could trigger cascading defaults, freezing credit markets and crashing asset values. "The consumer isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt going to even know they√¢¬Ä¬ôre on-chain," Sullivan noted, predicting that blockchain-based financial systems will soon replace traditional banking√¢¬Ä¬îwhether people realize it or not. The "Great Taking" √¢¬Ä¬ì A Global Wealth Confiscation Scheme Sullivan echoed concerns raised by financial analyst David Webb, author of The Great Taking, which warns of a coordinated effort by central banks and governments to seize private assets under the guise of financial "stability." "The central banks have done everything by corruption and fraud, not by skill," Sullivan said, emphasizing that CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) could be used to enforce compliance, restrict spending, and even block access to funds for dissenters. His advice? Self-custody assets√¢¬Ä¬îhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, you√¢¬Ä¬ôve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoption√¢¬Ä¬îeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs timeline? June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "They√¢¬Ä¬ôre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster. Final Warning: "Get Off Your Ass" Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs message was blunt: "Gold, silver, Bitcoin, privacy tokens√¢¬Ä¬îat a bare minimum." For those still holding dollars, his advice was simple: "Exit fiat√¢¬Ä¬înow." As the global financial system teeters, Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out.

As the global financial system teeters, Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs warning serves as a dire wake-up call: The time to decentralize is running out. Watch the full episode of the "Decentralized TV" with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, Todd Pitner and Chris Sullivan as they talk about Deflation vs. Hyperinflation.

Deflationary Collapse √¢¬Ä¬ì A debt implosion could trigger cascading defaults, freezing credit markets and crashing asset values. "The consumer isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt going to even know they√¢¬Ä¬ôre on-chain," Sullivan noted, predicting that blockchain-based financial systems will soon replace traditional banking√¢¬Ä¬îwhether people realize it or not. The "Great Taking" √¢¬Ä¬ì A Global Wealth Confiscation Scheme Sullivan echoed concerns raised by financial analyst David Webb, author of The Great Taking, which warns of a coordinated effort by central banks and governments to seize private assets under the guise of financial "stability." "The central banks have done everything by corruption and fraud, not by skill," Sullivan said, emphasizing that CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) could be used to enforce compliance, restrict spending, and even block access to funds for dissenters. His advice? Self-custody assets√¢¬Ä¬îhold Bitcoin, Monero, gold, and silver outside the banking system. Institutional Moves into Crypto & The Rise of Stablecoins Despite regulatory crackdowns, Sullivan revealed that smart money is already fleeing into crypto: BlackRock and other institutions are quietly accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge. Stablecoins like Tether may become critical if banks fail, allowing transactions outside the traditional system. Privacy coins (Monero, Zcash, Firo) are essential for anonymous transactions, especially as surveillance grows. "If you want the UBI, you√¢¬Ä¬ôve got to take the CBDC," Sullivan warned, predicting that governments will tie welfare benefits to digital currency adoption√¢¬Ä¬îeffectively forcing dependence on their controlled system. How to Prepare: Exit Fiat Now Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs survival blueprint includes: Self-custody crypto (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor). Physical precious metals (gold and silver, stored securely). Off-grid preparedness (food, water, land, and energy independence). Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap to avoid bank-controlled platforms. "The window for doing this is very small," he stressed, urging immediate action before financial controls tighten. The Countdown to Crisis Sullivan√¢¬Ä¬ôs timeline? June-July 2025 could mark the beginning of the end for the current financial system, with potential triggers including: A U.S. strike on Iran, disrupting oil markets. A Treasury default on Federal Reserve-held debt. A CBDC rollout accelerating the "Great Taking." "They√¢¬Ä¬ôre going to dump everything on Trump," Sullivan speculated, suggesting that the next administration may inherit an engineered economic disaster.

Title: Why is China angry about a plan to sell two ports on the Panama Canal?

Beijing‚Äôs displeasure over conglomerate‚Äôs plans highlights tightening business environment in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison, one of the largest conglomerates in Hong Kong, earlier this month announced plans to sell its stake in two ports on the Panama Canal to a group of US investors led by BlackRock. The plan, part of a $22.8bn megadeal that would grant the consortium control over more than 40 ports in 23 countries, followed complaints by United States President Donald Trump that the key shipping route was under Chinese control. CK Hutchison shares soared following news of the deal on March 4, but plunged less than two weeks later when Ta Kung Pao, a Chinese state-run newspaper in Hong Kong, accused the company in two op-eds of ‚Äúspineless grovelling‚Äù and cutting a deal ‚Äúthat betrayed and sold out all Chinese people‚Äù. With an April 2 deadline to sign the deal looming, CK Hutchison is now in the crosshairs of both Washington and Beijing. Why would China want to stop the deal? Editorials in Ta Kung Pao, which is controlled by Beijing‚Äôs liaison office in Hong Kong through a subsidiary, are often read as signals from the upper ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. Hong Kong leader John Lee, who was elected as the sole candidate in an election tightly controlled by Beijing, has criticised the CK Hutchison deal, saying it deserves ‚Äúserious attention‚Äù. The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to ‚Äútake back‚Äù the strategically important waterway. On Friday, China‚Äôs market regulator said on its official WeChat account that it would carry out an antitrust investigation ‚Äúin accordance with the law to protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest‚Äù. Following the news, local media, including the Sing Tao Daily and the South China Morning Post, reported that CK Hutchison would not go forward with the deal this week. What is Beijing‚Äôs relationship with CK Hutchison? The proposed sale has also highlighted longstanding tensions between Beijing and CK Hutchison and its 96-year-old billionaire founder, Li Ka-shing. Li‚Äôs rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China‚Äôs economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi‚Äôs rise to the top job in 2012. In 2015, Li raised eyebrows when he restructured his business interests and registered them in the Cayman Islands. Around this time, he also began to divest from China. In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong‚Äôs mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. While analysts have offered differing opinions on whether the Li family tacitly supported calls for democracy in Hong Kong, there is broad agreement that it is less visibly pro-Beijing than many of the city‚Äôs other business dynasties. ‚ÄúCompared to other family offices of his generation ‚Äì such as the Fok and Pao family, who invested in the mainland as early as the 1980s, or the Tung family, who are active in Sino-American relations and Hong Kong governance ‚Äì Li and his sons position themselves as businesspeople who invest globally and distance themselves from politics,‚Äù Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong‚Äôs Pagoda Institute, told Al Jazeera. Can Beijing stop the sale from going ahead? Chan said Beijing is relatively constrained in terms of formal regulatory authority to stop the deal. ‚ÄúIn strict legal terms, it will be quite difficult for Beijing and Hong Kong to call off the deal, given the companies and the ports involved are not ‚Äòlegally‚Äô located within the jurisdiction of China and Hong Kong,‚Äù he said. Ronny Tong, a Hong Kong barrister and member of the city‚Äôs Executive Council, said the antitrust investigation could be seen as a ‚Äúdeterrent‚Äù against CK Hutchison moving forward with the deal. Tong said Chinese regulators typically do not step in to block Hong Kong business deals, but are within their rights to investigate. ‚ÄúIf people carry on their business activities contrary to the law, they ought to be investigated to see whether they have fallen afoul of the law,‚Äù Tong told Al Jazeera. Experts quoted in the South China Morning Post said that Chinese regulators could claim legal jurisdiction over the deal by arguing that BlackRock‚Äôs acquisition of so many ports would give them a monopoly over regional trade routes. Proving that the deal would have an adverse impact on competition, however, could be more difficult, while invoking national security concerns could be challenging as BlackRock is a private company, the experts quoted by the Post said. Martina Fuchs, a business correspondent for the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, said she expects the deal to be delayed or called off as it has become ‚Äúhighly politicised.‚Äù ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs criticism of CK Hutchison‚Äôs move to sell the ports business also reflects its strategic interests in the region on the one hand side, and the growing pressure from US President Donald Trump to curb China‚Äôs influence as well as worries about national security on the other,‚Äù Fuchs told Al Jazeera. ‚ÄúCK Hutchison being thrust into the crosshairs in the midst of the once-again escalating China-US trade war reflects how both powers are battling for control of the strategic waterway,‚Äù she said. What other pressure can Beijing apply? Even without going through formal legal channels, Beijing could apply pressure in other ways. CK Hutchison‚Äôs affiliate companies and business interests in the mainland are a point of vulnerability, according to an analyst who covers China‚Äôs economy, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the political sensitivity of the issue. While CK Hutchison has wound down its investment in China, it still earns about 12 percent of its revenue from China ‚Äì representing more than $300m in 2024. Its sister company, CK Asset Holdings, still owns dozens of properties in mainland China, which means it is also very exposed to Beijing, the analyst said. Foreign and local companies in Hong Kong will be closely watching to see what happens next, he said. ‚ÄúThe wider Li family group of companies still has a meaningful amount of assets on the mainland, such as CK Asset‚Äôs property holdings. They are almost certainly aware that they could be exposed to retaliation from Beijing,‚Äù the analyst said. Kevin Yam, a lawyer who specialised in financial services and commercial litigation until he left Hong Kong in 2022, said Beijing could use the deal to make an example of the Li family, much as it did to Alibaba founder Jack Ma. After criticising China‚Äôs regulators in 2020, Ma was forced to cancel the IPO of Ant Financial, a financial subsidiary of Alibaba. Since then, he has only rarely been seen in public. ‚ÄúHong Kong being Hong Kong, chances are they won‚Äôt cut the Li family down to size to the same extent as they did to Jack Ma, but I reckon ultimately whichever way this thing is going to go ‚Ä¶ it won‚Äôt be directly about the deal,‚Äù Yam, who is wanted by Hong Kong police over his participation in the 2019 protests, told Al Jazeera. Beijing has not shied away from using extrajudicial methods against prominent citizens in the past. In 2017, Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua ‚Äì then one of China‚Äôs wealthiest people ‚Äì vanished from the luxury hotel where he was living in Hong Kong, with multiple media outlets reporting that he had been abducted by mainland Chinese agents. Xiao‚Äôs exact whereabouts remained unknown for five years until 2022, when a Shanghai court sentenced the tycoon to 13 years imprisonment for allegedly embezzling $8bn. In 2023, Bao Fan, an influential Chinese tech banker, went incommunicado amid a crackdown on the financial services industry. Bao, whose firm announced his resignation last year, has not been publicly heard from since. What‚Äôs next for the CK Hutchison deal? With just a day to go until the April 2 deadline, the fate of the sale is unclear. While Chinese regulators are looking into the deal, the Hong Kong government has yet to investigate, according to Tong, who sits on the cabinet of Hong Kong‚Äôs chief executive. On the Chinese mainland, the government appears to be making use of both the carrot and the stick. Last week, Li‚Äôs son Richard was invited to the China Development Forum, a high-profile business summit held annually in Beijing. While Richard is not involved in the management of CK Hutchison, the markets interpreted his invitation as a positive sign for the company‚Äôs relations with Beijing, sending its shares 3.4 percent higher last Monday. On Thursday, however, Bloomberg reported that Beijing had issued a directive to state-owned enterprises to hold off on new business with CK Hutchison and its affiliates, citing people familiar with the matter. While it is still uncertain whether CK Hutchison and BlackRock will go ahead with the deal, a delay would not necessarily stop it in its tracks. The deal reportedly includes a 145-day exclusivity clause for negotiations, after which time CK Hutchison would be free to sell its assets to another party, according to the Post. The Post said neither party had revealed ‚Äúthe start or end‚Äù of the exclusivity period. Tong said it was difficult to say more without official word from CK Hutchison or BlackRock. ‚ÄúVery few facts are known to the public,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú[CK Hutchison] is keeping mum, saying nothing at all, so people can only venture to guess what is happening.‚Äù Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: BlackRock, at centre of Panama ports deal, has nearly US$16 billion in Chinese stocks

SHANGHAI ‚Äî BlackRock, the asset manager at the centre of a deal to buy US$23 billion in port assets from Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings, has about $15.5 billion invested in Hong Kong and mainland-listed stocks through its China-focused funds, with its portfolios concentrated on technology and financial companies. According to its website, the world's largest money manager has at least seven funds dedicated to Chinese stocks; five are passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and two are actively managed. The funds' top holdings as of the end of February included Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and China Merchants Bank, according to fact sheets. Alibaba owns the Post. The largest is the $7.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF, which tracks the FTSE China 50 Index. The iShares MSCI China ETF, which tracks the MSCI China Index, ranked second with $6.3 billion in assets. The BlackRock China Fund is the larger of the two actively invested funds, with $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). The BlackRock China A Opportunities Fund, which targets yuan-denominated stocks in mainland China, had $15.7 million in AUM. BlackRock also manages other funds with regional or global scopes that may also be invested in Chinese equities. Earlier in March, CK Hutchison said it would sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock for US$23 billion. The deal triggered a backlash and on Friday, Beijing said it would launch an antitrust probe into the sale. US President Donald Trump, who had lobbied for the canal to be freed from what he called Chinese control, hailed the deal, amid trade-based tensions between Beijing and Washington. The New York-based asset manager did not reply to an email from the Post seeking comment. A BlackRock building is seen in New York, the United States. (File photo: Reuters) At the end of 2023, BlackRock had AUM of US$10 trillion with US$5.3 trillion invested in stocks worldwide, according to its latest annual report. The firm's iShares China Large-Cap ETF is up 18% this year and its iShares MSCI China ETF has risen 16%. Both have benefited from a stock market rally triggered by Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek's release of two powerful but cost-effective large language models. The BlackRock China Fund, managed by Lucy Liu and Ada Zhang, has gained 14% so far this year. Tencent was the fund's top holding, accounting for 9.2% of its assets, followed by Alibaba at 8.5% and Xiaomi at 6.5%. The firm's China A Opportunities Fund has underperformed with a 3.2% rise this year, though it bested a 1.2% loss for the CSI 300 Index of onshore stocks over the same period. Its top three holdings were EV battery maker CATL, China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance. As of March 17, BlackRock funds held a combined 984.8 million shares of Alibaba, representing a 5.2% stake, according to data from Hong Kong's stock exchange. It also held 47.4 million Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE, a maker of telecoms equipment, representing a stake of 6.2%. BlackRock also recently held a 5.09% stake in CK Hutchison. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has said after his meetings with global financial leaders, investors were saying they would increase their exposure to Chinese stocks. And global investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have raised their targets for major China stock indices this year, citing appealing valuations and the positive impact on earnings from DeepSeek's breakthrough. For its part, BlackRock has said it was cautious about the outlook for Chinese stocks. "We are modestly overweight," the BlackRock Investment Institute said in its latest weekly commentary on March 24. "We think AI and tech excitement could keep driving returns, potentially reducing the odds of much-anticipated government stimulus. We stand ready to pivot. We remain cautious given structural challenges to China's growth and tariff risks."

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Chinese President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by U.S. President Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a "predictable‚Äù business environment, China‚Äôs market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing‚Äôs deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to "protect public interests.‚Äù Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing Li's CK Hutchison Holdings of acting "in concert with U.S. hegemony‚Äù over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the U.S. president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock as America "reclaiming‚Äù the famed waterway.

Many families are still feeling the affects of the cost-of-living crisis.. Stock image A new survey has found that less than half of Irish workers believe that they can live a comfortable life after retirement. Financial advisers BlackRock surveyed 400 workers in Ireland, 300 of whom participate in Defined Contribution (DC) schemes ‚Äì workplace plans where both employer and employee contribute a certain amount. ‚ÄúThe 2025 survey highlights the importance of pensions in securing a comfortable retirement,‚Äù said Tim Hodgson, head of DC platforms and retirement solutions at BlackRock. ‚ÄúRetirement readiness remains a significant concern for many workers, with less than half (41pc) of survey participants feeling on-track for a reasonable standard of living in retirement. ‚ÄúThis concern is particularly acute among those without DC workplace pensions, with only 26pc feeling prepared.‚Äù Next September, Irish workers who are not already enrolled in a pension plan will be automatically added to the My Future Fund or the auto-enrolment plan. Under the scheme, employees aged between 23 and 60 earning above ‚Ç¨20,000 will be automatically enrolled into a pension scheme, unless they decide to opt out of it after six months. While participants showed interest in the scheme, the survey noted that there was a lack of understanding about the new pension plan and concerns about its affordability. In December, a report from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) found that just one in 10 employees eligible for the auto-enrolment plan were aware of it. ‚ÄúAs we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment, it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,‚Äù Mr Hodgson said. Out of the people surveyed who were not part of an existing pension plan, more than two-thirds said they would opt in to the scheme in year one but had concerns about affording it. The survey also noted generational differences in people‚Äôs attitude towards retirement. ‚ÄúPre-retirees [people aged 60 to 69] and Gen X [those aged 45 to 60] ranked saving for retirement among their top-three financial priorities, whereas millennials [29-44] ranked it last in their financial priorities,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThe introduction of auto enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement,‚Äù Mr Hodgson said.

Title: In Annual Letter, BlackRock‚Äôs Larry Fink Omits Climate Change, DEI, And ESG

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan, Contributor. Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, ... More Switzerland, on Friday, Jan. 24, 2025. Photographer: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg On March 31, BlackRock BLK CEO Larry Fink released his annual Chairman‚Äôs Letter to Investors. After years of advocacy, in 2024, Fink began rolling back support of environmental, social, and governance as a priority. In 2025, ESG, sustainability, climate change, and DEI were notably absent as he pushed for more energy production and the expansion of nuclear power. Managing over $11.6 trillion in assets, BlackRock Inc. is the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, giving them a large voice in international policy and reactions from businesses. Fink, BlackRock‚Äôs founder and CEO, was an early advocate for ESG and stakeholder capitalism, an approach to fiduciary duty that considers broader repercussions to the community and environment in making business decisions. However, conservatives took issue with climate policies and diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially as it relates to LGBTQ+ issues. As conservatives began pushing back on ESG in 2023, criticism of BlackRock and Fink quickly escalated. In response to the conservative backlash, Fink stated he will no longer be using the term ESG, as it had become too political. In the 2024 Chairman‚Äôs Letter to Investors, Fink avoided the phrase ESG, opting instead for the terms stakeholder capitalism, sustainable investing, or climate investing. However, none were mentioned in the 2025 letter, indicating a further separation from the issue. In the 2024 letter, Fink introduced a new term ‚Äî energy pragmatism. Fink explained that there is a balance between ‚Äúenergy transition‚Äù to renewable energy as part of the global push to address climate change, and the need for ‚Äúenergy security‚Äù spurred by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. By 2025, the the focus on energy shifted to the need for more development, specifically targeting the overly burdensome regulatory requirements and permit process. "In both the U.S. and the EU, it usually takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than to construct them. A high-voltage power line can take 13 years to get approved‚Äî something China does in a quarter of the time." ‚ÄúWe need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix.‚Äù Fink goes on to say, "Without massive investments in energy generation and transmission‚Äîand the electricians and engineers to build them‚Äîwe‚Äôre going to face an unacceptable tradeoff: Who gets the electricity‚Äîpeople or machines? And a society that chooses to cool its servers while its citizens swelter‚Äîor freeze‚Äîhas fundamentally misplaced its priorities. We need energy pragmatism. That starts with fixing the slow, broken permitting processes in the U.S. and Europe. But it also means being clear-eyed about our energy mix. "Most new infrastructure investments have been flowing into renewables. But without major breakthroughs in storage, wind and solar alone can‚Äôt reliably keep the lights on. In the near term, more than half the electricity powering data centers must come from dispatchable sources. Otherwise, the air conditioning will shut off, the servers will overheat, and the data centers will shut down. Where does dispatchable power come from? One source is nuclear." Fink‚Äôs focus on increased energy production and the adoption of new energy sources that may not align with the climate agenda is a notable shift to the right. This may be a result of his relationship with President Donald Trump or just a smart business move as the climate movement struggles globally. His criticism of overly burdensome regulations also aligns with recent actions by the European Union to simplify sustainability reporting requirements. The President of the European Commission is currently pushing a series of simplification measures, including the Omnibus Simplification Package, aimed at easing the regulatory burden on businesses in the EU. Whether Fink is driving the debate or simply reacting, the omissions in the annual letter are worth noticing.

Title: Goldman Sachs Flags 35% Recession Risk ‚Äî What This Means For Crypto

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto markets edged lower Monday following a stark warning from Goldman Sachs, which raised its 12-month US recession probability to 35%, citing rising tariffs, weakening growth, and deteriorating sentiment. The reassessment follows the firm‚Äôs second upward revision in March to its 2025 US tariff expectations, signaling an increasingly fraught macroeconomic environment with direct implications for risk assets ‚Äî including cryptocurrencies. In the note titled ‚ÄúUS Economics Analyst: A Further Increase in Our Tariff Assumptions‚Äù, Goldman economists Alec Phillips, Tim Walker, and David Mericle outline their rationale: ‚ÄúWe now expect the average US tariff rate to rise 15pp in 2025 [‚Ä¶] almost the entire revision reflects a more aggressive assumption for ‚Äòreciprocal‚Äô tariffs.‚Äù Goldman anticipates that President Trump will announce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs averaging 15% on April 2. Adjusted for product and country exclusions, the effective rise in average tariffs is expected to be around 9 percentage points. The impact on the macro outlook is stark: Goldman has downgraded its 2025 US GDP growth forecast by 0.5pp to 1.0% (Q4/Q4), lifted its year end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5% (+0.5pp), and increased its unemployment projection to 4.5% (+0.3pp). These revisions reflect a stagnating growth environment paired with inflationary pressures ‚Äî a combination that constrains monetary stimulus options. The bank attributes the rise in recession probability to three key factors: a lower growth baseline; deteriorating household and business confidence; and ‚Äústatements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness.‚Äù Despite historically poor predictive power from sentiment measures, Goldman writes: ‚ÄúWe are less dismissive of the recent decline because economic fundamentals are not as strong as in prior years. Most importantly, real income growth has already slowed sharply and we expect it to average only 1.4% this year.‚Äù While digital assets have long been viewed as uncorrelated to traditional macroeconomic variables, that narrative has evolved. Bitcoin, in particular, has become increasingly responsive to broader macro conditions ‚Äî particularly liquidity, risk sentiment, and real yields. As the yield curve inverts once again ‚Äî a classic recession signal ‚Äî macro analysts are warning of a unique policy dilemma. As @ecoinometrics noted on X: ‚ÄúThe yield curve is inverting again, a traditional recession signal. But unlike past cycles, the Fed is unlikely to rush to QE due to inflation concerns. This creates a double challenge for Bitcoin: potential risk-off pressure without the stimulus relief that typically follows. Bitcoin is very much driven by macro these days. It is behaving like a high-beta play on the NASDAQ 100.‚Äù However, not everyone agrees that a recession poses a net-negative risk for crypto. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, offered a nuanced view of Bitcoin‚Äôs macro sensitivity: ‚ÄúEconomic fears. I mean, I don‚Äôt know if we have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession. It‚Äôs catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus. That tends to happen in a recession.‚Äù Mitchnick acknowledges the short-term constraints ‚Äî the wealth effect, reduced disposable income, and high correlations with equities ‚Äî but maintains that structurally, Bitcoin benefits from the long-term consequences of recessionary policy responses. ‚ÄúBitcoin is long liquidity in the system‚Ä¶ and to some extent over just fears of general social disorder [‚Ä¶] that too, unfortunately, is something that can come up in a recession.‚Äù He adds that current market reactions may not reflect Bitcoin‚Äôs true positioning: ‚ÄúThe market has almost, it seems, gotten this in some ways not particularly well calibrated‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs where the opportunity comes in for education in a market and an asset class that‚Äôs still very nascent.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $83,230.

Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock Inc., wants to expand investor access to alternative investments and warned that too few Americans are saving for retirement in his annual chairman‚Äôs letter. Fink writes that the assets that will ‚Äúdefine the future‚Äù‚Äîincluding data centers, ports, power grids and the fastest-growing private companies‚Äîare out of reach for most investors, only accessible by institutions and high-net-worth individuals. ‚ÄúThe reason for the exclusivity has always been risk. Illiquidity. Complexity. That‚Äôs why only certain investors are allowed in,‚Äù Fink wrote. ‚ÄúBut nothing in finance is immutable. Private markets don‚Äôt have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate.‚Äù Never miss a story ‚Äî sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news. ÔÅ° Fink highlighted BlackRock‚Äôs recent acquisitions of private credit firm HPS Investment Partners, infrastructure manager Global Infrastructure Partners and alternatives data firm Preqin, pushing the firm beyond being a traditional asset manager. ‚ÄúBlackRock has always had a foot in private markets. But we‚Äôve been‚Äîfirst and foremost‚Äîa traditional asset manager,‚Äù Fink wrote. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs who we were at the start of 2024. But it‚Äôs not who we are anymore.‚Äù The 50/30/20 Portfolio and Infrastructure Fink‚Äôs letter suggested the standard portfolio of the future will include allocations to stocks, bonds and private assets, the latter acting as a diversifier, with infrastructure playing an important role. He described a new standard allocation of 50% stocks, 30% bonds and 20% alternatives. The traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio may well be a thing of the past. ‚ÄúGenerations of investors have done well following this approach, owning a mix of the entire market rather than individual securities,‚Äù Fink wrote. ‚ÄúBut as the global financial system continues to evolve, the classic 60/40 portfolio may no longer fully represent true diversification.‚Äù Fink noted three benefits of including infrastructure in a portfolio; inflation protection, volatility protection and strong historical returns. According to BlackRock, adding infrastructure to both a 60/40 portfolio and a pension portfolio increases returns and decreases portfolio volatility. Also according to BlackRock, $68 trillion in infrastructure investment will be needed between 2024 and 2040, which Fink described as the equivalent of building the U.S. interstate highway system and its transcontinental railroad every six weeks for 15 years. But for infrastructure investments to make sense for individuals and for retirement accounts, Fink called for the deregulation of infrastructure permitting. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt democratize investing if it takes 13 years to build a power line,‚Äù Fink wrote, noting that it typically takes longer to permit infrastructure projects than it takes to build them. ‚ÄúGiving retirement investors access to infrastructure matters less if the infrastructure never gets built. That‚Äôs often the case today.‚Äù Investing for Retirement According to a January BlackRock survey, 33% of Americans have no retirement savings, 51% are more worried about outliving their savings than about dying, and one-third of Americans would have a hard time paying an unexpected $500 bill. One way to fix the ‚Äúretirement gap‚Äù is to increase access to alternative investments in 401(k) plans, according to Fink. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need better ways to boost portfolios,‚Äù Fink wrote. ‚ÄúAs I wrote earlier, private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns. Pension funds have invested in these assets for decades, but 401(k)s haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs one reason why pensions typically outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% each year.‚Äù According to BlackRock, that additional 0.5% every year, when compounded over 40 years, will result in 14.5% more money in a 401(k) plan by the time of retirement. ‚ÄúOr, put another way, private assets just bought you nine extra years hanging out with your grandkids,‚Äù Fink wrote. Still, there is a long way to go before alternative investments become ubiquitous in employer-sponsored defined contributions plans. While the number of plan sponsors implementing alternative strategies in their plans has increased, sponsors are often faced with lawsuits by plan participants alleging that such investments are violating the plans‚Äô fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The illiquidity of these assets is another issue. ‚ÄúWhen you invest in private assets‚Äîlike a bridge, for example‚Äîthe values of those assets aren‚Äôt updated daily, and you can‚Äôt withdraw your money whenever you want,‚Äù Fink wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bridge, after all‚Äînot a stock.‚Äù But Fink is confident that alts will play a role in the retirement accounts of the future. ‚ÄúAsset managers, private-market specialists, consultants, and advisers all play a role in guiding 401(k) providers. That‚Äôs part of the reason I‚Äôm writing this letter‚Äîto cut through the fog,‚Äù Fink wrote. ‚ÄúWe need to make it clear: Private assets are legal in retirement accounts. They‚Äôre beneficial. And they‚Äôre becoming increasingly transparent.‚Äù Another important financial wellness tool for American, Fink wrote, is expanding emergency savings. ‚ÄúNo one invests for retirement if they‚Äôre worried about paying for a flat tire or ER visit tomorrow,‚Äù Fink wrote. He called the emergency savings provision of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 ‚Äújust a start‚Äù and suggested, ‚ÄúWe can simplify the rules further, raise contribution limits, and enable automatic enrollment in standalone emergency accounts.‚Äù Related Stories: BlackRock More Than Doubles Private Credit Business With HPS Investment Partners Acquisition BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink‚Äôs Annual Letter Tags: Alternative Investments, BlackRock, Larry Fink, Retirement ¬´ Temasek Asset Management Unit Seviora Opens Shop in Abu Dhabi

Title: BlackRock CEO warns US dollar could lose global reserve status to Bitcoin

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink issued a stark warning in his 2025 annual letter to investors, saying that the United States risks losing its global reserve currency status to Bitcoin. ‚ÄúIf the US doesn‚Äôt get its debt under control, if the deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,‚Äù Fink wrote in his 2025 annual letter to investors. His comments come as BlackRock‚Äôs own actions echo this conviction. Since launching its spot Bitcoin ETF, the asset manager has accumulated over 575,000 BTC, cementing its position as both the largest asset manager and the largest holder of Bitcoin in the ETF space. Fink‚Äôs remarks and the firm‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy signal that BlackRock views Bitcoin as the dominant digital asset class poised to lead the financial future. Although he emphasized his support for digital innovation, he warned that the same technology could erode America‚Äôs edge if investors begin viewing Bitcoin as a safer alternative to the dollar. Recent developments have underscored the urgency of Fink‚Äôs warning. Earlier this month, Moody‚Äôs downgraded its outlook on US debt to negative, citing rising concerns over former President Donald Trump‚Äôs new wave of tariffs and unfunded tax cuts. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Policy Center has projected that the US could default on its obligations as early as July if Congress fails to intervene. Fink‚Äôs warning on US debt came alongside an optimistic outlook on innovation. He described tokenization as one of the most transformative shifts in modern finance. Arguing that converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens would revolutionize investing by enabling instant settlement, democratized access, and better yields. ‚ÄúEvery stock, every bond, every fund‚Äîevery asset‚Äîcan be tokenized,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIf they are, it will revolutionize investing.‚Äù The key challenge, he said, is identity verification, which remains a technical and regulatory bottleneck for tokenized markets. Fink cited India‚Äôs Aadhaar system as a potential model for the digital financial infrastructure needed to scale such solutions globally. Despite the anxiety voiced by clients and leaders worldwide, Fink expressed long-term optimism in capital markets, calling them one of the most powerful human systems ever created. Yet even that system, he warned, may not be enough to preserve US dominance if Washington fails to get its fiscal house in order. Share this article Sign in to your account Don‚Äôt have an account?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Issues US Dollar Warning, Says Greenback at Risk of Losing World Reserve Status to Bitcoin

The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that the US dollar may be losing its reserve status to Bitcoin (BTC). In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that US dollar supremacy can‚Äôt last forever and is already being weakened ‚Äì not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, ‚ÄúThe U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world‚Äôs reserve currency for decades. But that‚Äôs not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square‚Äôs debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion‚Äî exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn‚Äôt get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I‚Äôm obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America‚Äôs economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.‚Äù BlackRock heavily invested in Bitcoin in 2024 with the launch of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which would ultimately become the most successful exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch of all time. Fink, who oversees $11.5 trillion in assets at BlackRock, notes how the world‚Äôs financial system runs on ‚Äúplumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary,‚Äù opening the door for smoother, faster technology like blockchain-based tokenization. The CEO says, ‚ÄúIf SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself.‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery stock, every bond, every fund‚Äîevery asset‚Äîcan be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn‚Äôt need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth. Perhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.‚Äù Featured Image: Shutterstock/Blackdog1966/Andy Chipus Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: BlackRock CEO: 'Protectionism Has Returned With Force'

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink didn't mention President Trump by name in his widely read letter to shareholders in the world's largest asset manager‚Äîbut days ahead of the rollout of Trump's latest tariffs, he noted that "protectionism has returned with force." "I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader‚Äînearly every person‚ÄîI talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory," Fink wrote. "I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out." Treading cautiously. Fink "treads cautiously" in the influential letter this year, Axios notes. In previous years, calls for BlackRock to do more to tackle climate change and improve workplace diversity led to a backlash from Republicans, reports Reuters. But with the rollback of diversity policies and a deal to buy Panama Canal ports from a Hong Kong-based company, the firm is back in the GOP's good books. "Not everyone has shared in this wealth." Fink said more people are investing in the US stock market, "but not everyone has shared in this wealth," the Financial Times reports. He said that while globalization lifted a billion people around the world out of poverty, "it also held back millions in wealthier nations striving for a better life." "The unspoken assumption is that capitalism didn't work and it's time to try something new," he wrote. "But there's another way to look at it: Capitalism did work‚Äîjust for too few people." Leveling the playing field. Fink, whose firm oversees more than $11 trillion in assets, called for the "democratization" of investing, saying individuals should have greater access to the private assets that have delivered large returns to big investors like pension funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Assets that will define the future‚Äîdata centers, ports, power grids, the world's fastest-growing private companies‚Äîaren't available to most investors," he wrote. "They're in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants." The full letter, which touches on subjects including bitcoin, nuclear power, and artificial intelligence, can be seen here. (More Larry Fink stories.)

Title: China halts Hong Kong-based Hutchison's port deal with US-led consortium in Panama

We translate Global Voices stories to make the world's citizen media available to everyone. Panama Canal. Screenshot from YouTube HISTORY channel. Fair Use. The Hong Kong-listed CK Hutchison corporation became the target of China's ire after the corporation seemed poised to make a multibillion-dollar port deal with a US-led international consortium, selling 43 ports with 199 berths in 23 countries. The deal was initially set to be signed on or before April 2, 2025, but it is now on hold due to Beijing's opposition. The agreement, which was announced on March 4, 2025, took Beijing by surprise as among the 43 ports are the two biggest ports in Panama, Cristobal and Balboa. The buyer is the US investment firm BlackRock Inc., along with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an infrastructure investment firm recently acquired by BlackRock, and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), a terminal operator owned by a Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company. Once the deal was made public, US President Donald Trump hailed victory for ‚Äúreclaiming‚Äù the Canal, while Hong Kong-listed CK Hutchison was quickly blamed for China's diplomatic setback. Eventually, China's State Administration for Market Regulation stated it would review the deal to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, and the Hong Kong-based multinational had to defer its plan. It‚Äôs now uncertain if the deal will go through at all, even though the package did not include any ports from China and Hong Kong. Geopolitical scientists pointed out that Beijing's reaction was related to its interest in maintaining the country's global trade network: #Panama: Why did #China pressure Hutchison Port Holdings to delay the @BlackRock deal? Hutchison was the single largest Chinese company in the business. A deal for 43 ports in 23 countries ‚Äî 199 berths ‚Äî would have meant one-third of #PRC‚Äòs global port network wiped out instantly. pic.twitter.com/fYxyAqV8R1 ‚Äî Ryan Berg, PhD (@RyanBergPhD) March 28, 2025 However, its decision has now both jeopardised Hong Kong's image as a free-trade center and also seemingly verified Donald Trump's accusation that Hutchison was acting as an extended arm of China to control the artificial canal that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. The foreign interference allegations could become an excuse for the US to take control of the Panama Canal by force under the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, which was signed in 1977, when the US handed the Canal over to Panama. It guarantees that the Canal shall be permanently neutral to vessels of all nations both in time of peace and in time of war and that the US could use its military to defend the Panama Canal against any threat to its neutrality. In fact, Donald Trump threatened to take over the Canal soon after his presidential inauguration. He accused China of foreign interference in Panama and described the Canal transit fee as ‚Äúexorbitant‚Äù. The Chinese government rebuked the accusation, stressing that ‚ÄúChina does not take part in managing or operating the Canal. Never ever has China interfered.‚Äù Panama also denied the Chinese interference claim, but under US pressure, the country eventually quit China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative in early February 2025 and has been strengthening ties with the US: REPORT: Panama will now allow United States Navy ships free passage through the Panama Canal, saving the United States millions of dollars a year. The development comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio‚Äôs trip to Panama. ‚ÄúU.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jACxs1sK6o ‚Äî Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) February 6, 2025 And, on the legal front, Panama‚Äôs attorney general backed the claim that concessions with Hong Kong‚Äôs Hutchison Ports on the Panama Canal are ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù. Caught in the crossfire between Beijing and Washington, CK Hutchison‚Äôs deal was initially well-received by the market, as reflected in its stock price surge. The USD 22.8 billion sell-off could generate USD 19 billion in cash and could prevent further political pressure from the US government, which might result in the nullification of Hutchison‚Äôs port contract with Panama. Since 1997, Hutchison has invested over USD 2 billion in the two port facilities, and in 2021, the concession was extended for another 25 years. However, China is not happy. Although the Chinese foreign ministry still stuck to the political line that the allegation concerning China‚Äôs control over the Canal was a lie and protested ‚Äúeconomic coercion, hegemonism and bullying‚Äù after the agreement was released, Hong Kong-based Chinese propaganda slammed CK Hutchison‚Äôs deal as a betrayal of the ‚Äúmotherland‚Äù through a series of commentaries which were republished on the website of Beijing‚Äôs top office on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. The patriotic opinion pieces were first published in China's state-funded Ta Kung Pao on March 14. The first piece rejects CK Hutchison‚Äôs explanation that the deal was a purely commercial decision. It describes Blackrock‚Äôs role as an expanding US port operator that would repress China‚Äôs international trade upon taking over CK Hutchison‚Äôs port and concludes the deal was an act of betrayal: ‚Ä¶Á∂≤ÂèãÊôÆÈÅçÂ∞çÈÄôÂÄã‰∫§ÊòìÂíåÈï∑Ê±üÂíåË®òÂÖ¨Âè∏ÊèêÂá∫Âº∑ÁÉàË≥™ÁñëÂíåÊâπË©ïÔºåË™çÁÇ∫ÈÄôÊòØÊ≤íÊúâËÖ∞È™®ÁöÑË∑™‰ΩéÔºåÊòØÂîØÂà©ÊòØÂúñ„ÄÅË¶ãÂà©ÂøòÁæ©ÔºåÊº†Ë¶ñÂúãÂÆ∂Âà©Áõä„ÄÅÊ∞ëÊóèÂ§ßÁæ©ÔºåËÉåÂèõÂíåÂá∫Ë≥£ÂÖ®È´î‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫„ÄÇ [Social media users] in general strongly criticise the deal and CK Hutchison for being spineless, grovelling and profit-seeking. [Such an act] trades away one‚Äôs integrity for personal gains, disregards national interests, and betrays all Chinese people. The second commentary praises other Hong Kong business leaders, including Henry Fok Ying-tung and Yue-kong Pao, for staying loyal to the party and, in particular, highlights Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei‚Äôs role in safeguarding the technological sovereignty of the Chinese telecommunication industry. It urges Chinese businessmen to safeguard China‚Äôs national interest. The third and fourth pieces were written in a similar manner, stressing the need for the business sector to serve national interest and demanding that CK Hutchison suspend the deal. Pro-Beijing influencers also relay China‚Äôs discontent. @Hnbhger17, for example, argued on X that CK Hutchison should prioritize selling its port to Chinese corporations, or the deal would negatively impact China's national security. Many media outlets interpreted the propaganda messages as a sign that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, was angry about the deal. Meanwhile, Hong Kong‚Äôs top leader, John Lee, stressed: We oppose the abusive use of coercion, of bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations [‚Ä¶] the SAR government will ensure that any transactions are made in accordance with the law. Eventually, China said it would scrutinise the port deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. Yet, since CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and the port deal has not included any port in Chinese territories, both Hong Kong and China have a relatively weak legal position to challenge the agreement. Though, as law expert Kevin Yam pointed out, the Hong Kong‚Äôs National Security Committee still has the power to give legally binding directions to the Li family or the Hong Kong-based multinational to procure the halting of the Panama port deal, adding that such an act would be a ‚Äúnuclear option‚Äù that could cause immense harm to the business sector. CK Hutchison‚Äôs retired founder Li Ka-Shing has faced many rounds of political criticism in the past decade ‚Äî in October 2014, he was criticised by China's state-owned Xinhua News for not vocally denouncing the pro-democracy Umbrella Protests. The state-owned news outlet again criticised Li for moving his investment offshore to the Cayman Islands after a major corporate restructuring in 2015. Li dismissed the so-called ‚ÄúCultural Revolution style‚Äù criticisms. In 2019, during Hong Kong's pro-democracy protest movement, Li faced similar criticism as he did not use strong words to condemn the street protests. Li Ka-Shing retired in 2018 and handed over his businesses to his son, Victor Li. The 96-year-old tycoon remains a legendary figure. He built his business empire from scratch after his family fled to Hong Kong in 1940 amid the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). He was among the first batch of Hong Kong businessmen who brought foreign capital into Chinese special economic zones after former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping adopted the Open Door Policy in the 1970s. While China's interest in the port in Panama makes sense, the dispute could very well scare foreign investments and multinationals away from Hong Kong. Beijing‚Äôs public pressure campaign against the Hong Kong-listed firm CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to control the city's independent business interests. https://t.co/08jcdaudmR pic.twitter.com/2cpzWMFOoe ‚Äî The Diplomat (@Diplomat_APAC) March 28, 2025 Global Voices stands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo (Bloomberg) ‚Äî President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a ‚Äúpredictable‚Äù business environment, China‚Äôs market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing‚Äôs deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to ‚Äúprotect public interests.‚Äù Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. of acting ‚Äúin concert with US hegemony‚Äù over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the US president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock Inc. as America ‚Äúreclaiming‚Äù the famed waterway. Beijing‚Äôs attempts to influence the operations of a private firm in Latin America risk undercutting Xi‚Äôs bid to bolster confidence in the world‚Äôs No. 2 economy, where foreign investment last year fell to the lowest level in decades. Derailing the deal could also give credence to the US leaders‚Äô claims CK Hutchison is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party ‚Äî a perception with implications for private Chinese companies worldwide. ‚ÄúThis flies in the face of the charm offensive for private firms,‚Äù said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University‚Äôs China Center, formerly chief economist at UBS. ‚ÄúBeijing has, in effect, told the world there is no real difference between private and public in the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs eyes.‚Äù CK Hutchison shares dropped the most in more than a week after resuming trading Monday. Work on the Panama ports deal is continuing, though the parties won‚Äôt be able to sign the definitive agreement by the original target of April 2, people familiar with the matter said. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing opposed coercion at a regular briefing Monday in Beijing, referring to Trump‚Äôs efforts to pressure the Panama government to curb Chinese influence. The State Administration for Market Regulation didn‚Äôt respond to a faxed request for comment. The Panama Canal, used mainly by the US and China, became a geopolitical lightning rod after Trump vowed to retake it. The US president has falsely said the canal is operated by the Chinese and controlled by the Chinese military. CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous former British colony where companies are given wide berth to operate free from Beijing‚Äôs control. The spat over the ports comes at a delicate time, as China grapples with a US trade war that will likely this week see Trump unveil new so-called reciprocal tariffs. For Xi, there are few good options: Blocking the Panama deal risks more retaliation from Washington, while letting it go ahead removes a potential bargaining chip once negotiations between Chinese and US officials finally get underway. The dilemma also comes as the Chinese leader tries to build on DeepSeek‚Äôs AI breakthrough spurring a revival in animal spirits, with Xi‚Äôs recent embrace of Jack Ma signaling to CEOs the era of regulatory crackdowns is over. ‚ÄúBeijing won‚Äôt hesitate to intervene if it believes a Chinese company is being pressured by a foreign government to sell its assets to foreign investors,‚Äù research firm Trivium China said in a note. Until a formal agreement on the port deal is signed, China‚Äôs ability to directly block the transaction is limited. That could explain why Beijing is ramping up pressure through less formal channels, hoping that Li will walk away from the deal. Opening a probe into a deal spanning 43 facilities over multiple continents would mark the latest example of Beijing extending the long arm of its statecraft toolkit. That comes after China last year expanded its export control regime to include a ban on selling some goods to the US by applying it to companies both inside and outside China. Beijing has precedent for influencing deals overseas when the companies involved have a major presence in China. Chinese officials effectively scuttled Intel Corp.‚Äôs $5.4 billion bid for Israel‚Äôs Tower Semiconductor Ltd. in 2023 by delaying approval as US-China tensions rose. The year before, DuPont de Nemours Inc. scrapped a proposed $5.2 billion acquisition of Rogers Corp. after failing to get timely clearance from Beijing. China sales accounted for more than a third of Rogers‚Äô 2021 revenue. China could even frame its action as a countermeasure to foreign sanctions, invoking a new law that gives Beijing broad power to strike back at perceived foreign meddling, according to Winston Ma, adjunct law professor at New York University. ‚ÄúThe countermeasure could have far-reaching implications for cross-border transactions and the various parties involved,‚Äù Ma said. After years of deleveraging from China, CK Hutchison now gets more than 80% of its revenue from overseas countries including the UK, Canada and Australia. That means Beijing has limited scope to influence Li directly. But his two sons are more exposed. CK Asset ‚Äî the company‚Äôs property arm now headed by Li‚Äôs older son Victor ‚Äî has one-fifth of its long-term rental investment property portfolio by area on the mainland. Richard Li‚Äôs insurance company, FWD Group Holdings Ltd., has stated its ambition to expand into mainland China in financial documents, which would likely require partnerships with Chinese companies. For the Hong Kong conglomerate caught in the crossfire, there are downsides to both outcomes, according to Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics. If the deal goes ahead, Li‚Äôs affiliated companies in China ‚Äúcould be exposed to a substantial fine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf the deal collapses, the risk is that the company will now be seen as part and parcel of Chinese interests abroad.‚Äù ¬© 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Could Threaten Dollar‚Äôs Reserve Currency Status, BlackRock‚Äôs Larry Fink

Still a big fan of digital assets, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink nevertheless said he's not blind to the possible risks to the U.S. from Bitcoin's (BTC) rise to prominence. ‚ÄúThe U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world‚Äôs reserve currency for decades," said Fink in his annual letter to shareholders.But that‚Äôs not guaranteed to last forever ‚Ä¶ If the U.S. doesn‚Äôt get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.‚Äù "I'm obviously not anti-digital assets," Fink continued." But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America's economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar." Fink‚Äôs letter comes at a time of high market uncertainty and anxiety among investors about the economic state of the country amid policy changes set in place by U.S. President Donald Trump. To balance out the national deficit, Fink said, investors should diversify their portfolios to add private market assets in addition to stocks and bonds. Doubling down on his commitment and belief in digital assets, Fink said he believes that tokenized funds will be as well-known among investors as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), provided that the industry can create a better infrastructure for digital identities, which Fink believes to be a hurdle in getting institutional investors from fully embracing decentralized finance. ‚ÄúEvery stock, every bond, every fund‚Äî every asset‚Äîcan be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,‚Äù he wrote. ‚Äú If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.‚Äù BlackRock, in January 2024, became one of the issuers to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Their product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), became the most successful ETF in the history of the asset class. As of today, the fund handles nearly $50 billion in assets, with half of that coming from retail investors. The asset manager has also issued a tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which is on track to cross $2 billion in assets by April, making it the largest tokenized fund currently on the market.

Title: Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock ‚Äî this time in private markets

Time Published: 2025-03-31T14:50:49Z

BlackRock was founded as a "traditional asset manager," and it became the largest by disrupting that industry by offering cheap ETFs to the masses. But, as the firm's cofounder and CEO, Larry Fink, wrote in his annual letter, "It's not who we are anymore." "We've transformed our company," Fink wrote about the $11.6 trillion juggernaut. The firm's private-market ambitions are no secret ‚Äî BlackRock spent $28 billion last year buying up Global Infrastructure Partners and HPS Investment Partners as well as Preqin, a data provider that focuses on private markets. Fink and fellow executives have spoken at length about their ambitions in the area on earnings calls and more. Still, it's rare for any company to pivot away from what has been its bread-and-butter profit engine, much less the industry leader. BlackRock's business lines in public markets, from its overwhelming iShares ETF line to its fixed-income mutual fund products, manage trillions of dollars, produce billions in revenue each year, and have fundamentally changed the way markets and investors behave. But Fink wrote that he is eyeing something bigger with BlackRock's next phase: the "$68 billion investment boom" coming in privately funded infrastructure, the continued explosion of private lending, and eventually, the indexing of private markets. "In some ways, this moment feels like a bookend to how BlackRock started," Fink wrote. When the firm was founded 37 years ago, Fink wrote, it changed the asset management industry thanks to its risk management software known as Aladdin. The firm's ETF business ‚Äî which manages more than $4 trillion ‚Äî brought down fees industrywide in both active and passive funds, squeezing asset manager margins in ways they'd never been before. "Decades from now, we might reflect on 2025 as another pivotal moment, when the financial landscape shifted once again," he wrote. And it is shifting to the private markets because the 60-40 portfolio that had investors split assets between public equities and bonds will become the 50-30-20 portfolio, with a fifth of capital going "assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit," Fink wrote. That type of portfolio for the typical individual investor ‚Äî the ones not in the upper tiers of the tax bracket, but instead saving for retirement with BlackRock index funds ‚Äî has been unobtainable, Fink wrote, thanks to high minimums and other restrictions on private-market investing. "The divide between public and private markets is a tough problem ‚Äî but it's solvable. In fact, BlackRock has solved market challenges like this before," Fink wrote, comparing it to the divide between active and passive investing in the public markets. "We see an opportunity to do for the public-private market divide what we did for index vs. active," he said. While Fink's letter has some political undertones, addressing wealth disparities and how markets and capitalism have exacerbated them, it does not mention ESG investing or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Fink was a leading voice on both issues prior to the new US administration, but BlackRock has joined others in the corporate world in toning down past statements. The manager's latest annual report reframed its DEI section as "connectivity and inclusivity," Business Insider previously reported. Fink, who wrote that he started on Wall Street in the 1970s with "long hair, turquoise jewelry, and the world's ugliest brown suit," is nonetheless optimistic despite the political turmoil. He closed his letter stating that the firm "entered 2025 at our strongest inflection point, and I see greater opportunities ahead for BlackRock, our clients, and our shareholders than ever before."

Title: BlackRock‚Äôs Larry Fink confirms Bitcoin could replace US dollar as global currency amid rising US debt

BlackRock chairman warns that unchecked U.S. deficits could pave the way for Bitcoin to become a global reserve currency. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink officially recognized in his 2025 annual letter to shareholders that Bitcoin can challenge the U.S. dollar‚Äôs status as the global reserve currency. The letter explicitly frames Bitcoin as both a disruptive innovation and a geopolitical risk should the U.S. government fail to rein in debt and deficits. Fink wrote in the firm‚Äôs March 2025 letter, ‚ÄúIf the U.S. doesn‚Äôt get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,‚Äù The comment marks a clear acknowledgment from the head of the world‚Äôs largest asset manager that digital assets could represent an alternative to the U.S. dollar in global markets. Fink mentioned Bitcoin by name seven times throughout the letter while referencing the dollar eight times. The significance of this parallel frequency in Fink‚Äôs annual letter cannot be overstated. A few years ago, who would have thought that Larry Fink would spend as much time talking about Bitcoin as the US dollar in an annual letter to investors? The BlackRock letter outlines a split view that while DeFi is praised as ‚Äúan extraordinary innovation,‚Äù the firm cautions that its growth could undermine America‚Äôs financial primacy. The risk emerges if investors begin treating Bitcoin as a more stable long-term store of value than the U.S. dollar, particularly given ongoing federal deficits and sovereign debt levels. This framing positions Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset or store of value and as a macro hedge against sovereign instability. The implications parallel similar arguments made in recent years by institutional investors treating digital assets as insurance against monetary debasement or geopolitical volatility. As Fink emphasized, ‚Äútwo things can be true at the same time,‚Äù referring to the coexistence of innovation and risk in digital asset development. BlackRock‚Äôs internal positioning on Bitcoin is not purely theoretical. The letter disclosed that its U.S.-based Bitcoin ETF became the largest product launch in the history of the ETF industry, reaching over $50 billion in assets under management within its first year. It also ranked third in net asset inflows across all ETF categories, behind only S&P 500 index funds. Retail adoption was a key driver, with more than half the demand for the firm‚Äôs Bitcoin ETP coming from individual investors. Notably, three-quarters of those participants had never previously owned an iShares product, suggesting Bitcoin is acting as an onboarding mechanism for a new demographic of investors. The firm has also expanded its ETP offerings into Canada and Europe, signaling cross-border growth in institutional-grade Bitcoin investment vehicles. Beyond Bitcoin, Fink‚Äôs letter advanced a broader thesis that tokenization could transform capital markets in ways comparable to the shift from postal mail to email. Drawing a comparison to the SWIFT network, Fink argued that tokenized asset infrastructure could bypass traditional financial intermediaries by enabling instant, peer-to-peer asset movement. BlackRock sees tokenization as a foundational shift in asset ownership, mainly through fractionalization, improved voting systems, and increased access to high-yield investment instruments. According to the letter, these developments could democratize capital markets by lowering the operational and legal barriers that have historically limited retail investor participation in certain asset classes. The firm also emphasized the need for updated digital identity systems, citing India‚Äôs model as a benchmark. According to the letter, over 90% of Indians can securely verify smartphone transactions, positioning the country as a leader in the digital infrastructure necessary for tokenized economies. The inclusion of Bitcoin as a potential replacement for the dollar reflects a material shift in institutional perception. While mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù has grown in recent years, BlackRock‚Äôs language points to a deeper economic thesis‚Äîone in which macroeconomic policy failure could accelerate a pivot to decentralized monetary systems. By citing both tokenization and Bitcoin within the same strategic outlook, the letter presents a framework where digital assets are possible systemic alternatives to fiat. For policymakers, the message is implicit but pointed: the U.S. must modernize its financial systems and manage its debt trajectory to maintain monetary leadership.
