Many more houses and apartments need to be built. Stock image: Getty The squeeze on home buyers has intensified after property prices shot up again in the year to May. It was the 21st month in a row of rising home values. The national property price index increased by 7.9pc in the 12 months to May, up from 7.6pc in the year to April, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.9pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc compared with May last year. The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to May 2025 was €370,000. This is up €5,000 on the median, or typical, price paid in April. The cost of a typical home is now up by €35,000 since May last year. The highest median price for a dwelling was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €186,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €770,000. Castlerea, Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €150,000. In May 2025, 3,824 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.6bn. These purchases were made up of 2,913 existing dwellings and 911 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,388 first-time buyer purchases in May. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border, which consists of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, at 11.1pc. Prices an average of 10pc in the Mid-West, which consists of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary. At the other end of the scale, the South-East, comprising Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, saw a 7.7pc rise in house prices, the CSO said. This week the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there will be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said Government targets set to be missed in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels mean the outlook for housing remains bleak. ESRI research professor with the ESRI Conor O’Toole said these factors, coupled with the out-turn for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, mean the group does “not foresee any major uptick in 2025 and 2026 in housing supply”. He said the ESRI is currently forecasting 33,000 units in 2025 and 37,000 units in 2026, which would be well below Government targets of 41,000 this year and 43,000 next year. Furthermore, Mr O’Toole added most of the risks “weigh on the downside”. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. The banking lobby group said 17pc consumers in Ireland, or almost one in five, report that they were looking to rent or buy. This is according to the February 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey.

Title: Property prices pick up pace again in May - CSO

David Murphy Economics and Public Affairs Editor Irish residential property prices increased by 7.9% in the 12 months to May, marginally higher than the 7.6% rise in year up to April, according to latest figures from the Central Statistics Office. Prices rose faster outside the capital where they were up 8.7% while the cost of buying a home in Dublin was up 6.9%. The median price of buying a home in the 12 months to May was €370,000. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to May was A94 in Blackrock in Dublin with a median price of €770,000, while F45 in Castlerea in Roscommon had the least expensive price of €150,000. "In the 12 months to May 2025, house prices in Dublin rose by 6.8% while apartment prices increased by 7.2%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 9.3% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 5.1%," the CSO said. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.9% and apartment prices rose by 6.7%. The CSO said the region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 11.1%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) recorded a 7.7% rise. Commenting on today's figures, Trevor Grant, the chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, noted that property prices continue to rise faster than incomes, pushing homeownership even further out of reach for many, especially first-time buyers who are now regularly competing with trader-uppers for an ever-shrinking pool of second-hand homes. He said that with supply still falling well short of demand, this imbalance is not likely to correct itself anytime soon. Mr Grant said that the median mortgage for a first-time buyer has surged by 36% since 2019 (according to BPFI data), now sitting just shy of €300,000. For buyers in high-cost areas, this number is even higher. "Despite that pressure, mortgage approvals have hit record highs. Buyer appetite remains strong, especially among first-time buyers," he said. "One in three first time buyer (FTB) homes were valued over €400,000 in 2024, three times the 2019 share. And it has recently been reported that average household incomes for new buyers sits at €85,000, so it's clear that affordability continues to be stretched, " he stated. He also said that while mortgage interest rates have eased in recent months, and some lenders are now offering sub-3% rates, affordability pressures remain severe. Properties are regularly selling well above asking price, with recent reports stating that one in six or seven now are going 20% over, he added. Mr Grant said the fundamental issue continues to be the chronic undersupply of housing - with just over 30,000 completions in 2024. "Yet we know we need at least 50,000 new homes per year for the next five years to meet demand," he said. He said the shortage of private supply is particularly acute, and developers are still facing major challenges, including rising build costs, planning bottlenecks, and labour shortages. "Delays in connecting new homes to essential utilities like water and electricity are also adding to delivery timelines and further restricting the pace of supply. Without targeted intervention to boost output and streamline the development process, house price inflation will persist," he added.

Title: ‘You Can’t Put the Genie Back’: Bitwise CIO Reveals Why Crypto May Never Be the Same Again

The conversation around cryptocurrency in the United States appears to be entering a new phase as key legislation gains traction in Congress. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the passage of several pro-crypto bills under discussion in Washington could have lasting implications for the market. In a note to clients, Hougan emphasized the long-term structural shift underway, stating that once these bills pass, “you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” The legislative push, dubbed “Crypto Week” by Hougan, follows a declaration by the US House of Representatives to advance three major pieces of digital currency-focused legislation. These include the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins; the CLARITY Act, designed to regulate broader digital currency assets; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the introduction of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). The GENIUS Act has already cleared the Senate, placing it a step closer to becoming law. Hougan argues that regulatory clarity could play a pivotal role in reducing systemic risk across the digital asset industry. He noted that many of the high-profile failures in the digital currency space, including FTX, Terra (Luna), Celsius, and Mt. Gox, were enabled by a lack of oversight. In the absence of defined rules, offshore platforms with inadequate internal controls and auditing were able to thrive, resulting in significant losses for users. He contends that proper legislation could have prevented such failures. “If clear regulations had allowed safer versions of these services to exist in the US, many of the historical blow-ups might not have occurred,” Hougan stated. Regulatory guidelines, according to the note, could also facilitate entry for traditional financial institutions, allowing for crypto custody and services through familiar, regulated channels. That shift could improve investor confidence and potentially limit the frequency and severity of market drawdowns. Hougan also believes that the passage of these bills could diminish the likelihood of future extreme price crashes. While Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets over the last 15 years, its history includes multiple drawdowns exceeding 70%. Hougan argues that enhanced regulation could limit the impact of unpredictable events that trigger such volatility. While some may question whether future administrations could reverse pro-crypto momentum, Hougan remains unconcerned. He pointed out that support for legislation like the GENIUS Act has been bipartisan, passing the Senate 68-30 with significant backing from both Democrats and Republicans. He attributes this cross-party alignment not only to generational voter interests but also to Wall Street’s growing involvement in crypto. According to Hougan, as financial institutions like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley expand their crypto operations, the likelihood of political reversal diminishes. “As a broader array of investors and firms becomes involved in crypto, it will be increasingly difficult for politicians to align against it,” he said. Should these legislative efforts succeed, Hougan concludes that crypto is positioned to transition further into the mainstream. With clearer rules, reduced risk, and rising institutional support, the digital asset market may be entering a new era of growth and maturity.

Title: Why the World Needs Bitcoin Now More Than Ever

A stylized representation of Bitcoin’s decentralized network. Bitcoin operates without central control, enabling financial freedom through peer-to-peer transactions. Bitcoin isn’t just an investment or a buzzword – it’s a beacon of hope and freedom in a world facing unprecedented economic and social challenges. Around the globe, people are confronting rising inflation, inequitable access to banking, costly remittances, and authoritarian financial controls. In this context, Bitcoin emerges as more than a technology; it is a movement empowering individuals with financial sovereignty. The following sections explore how, right now, Bitcoin is catalyzing economic inclusion, safeguarding value against inflation, streamlining global payments, empowering the oppressed, and spurring a revolution in decentralized innovation. The message is clear and urgent: the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever. 1. Economic Freedom and Financial Inclusion: Banking the Unbanked Billions of people worldwide remain unbanked or underbanked, locked out of traditional finance . This lack of access means missed opportunities and vulnerability to exploitation. Bitcoin offers a lifeline of economic freedom. With nothing more than a smartphone and internet, anyone can create a Bitcoin wallet and join the global economy . There are no gatekeepers demanding paperwork or minimum balances – Bitcoin’s network is open to all. In places where banking infrastructure is weak, Bitcoin is filling the gap. Nigeria is a powerful example. Despite over 55% of Nigerians lacking bank accounts, the country ranks second worldwide in crypto adoption . An astonishing 47% of Nigerians aged 18–64 have used cryptocurrency, the highest rate globally . Young entrepreneurs in Lagos or Kano aren’t waiting for banks – they’re using Bitcoin to start businesses, pay bills, and store savings in a way that was impossible before. Even a government ban couldn’t stem this tide; peer-to-peer Bitcoin trade flourished until the ban was lifted in late 2023 . This grassroots movement shows Bitcoin’s inclusive power: it is simply the most efficient way for many Nigerians to conduct daily transactions, from buying groceries to paying for phone credit . We see a similar story in El Salvador, where about 70% of the population was unbanked prior to 2021 . By making Bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador enabled millions of citizens to leapfrog into digital finance via mobile wallets. Suddenly, a single mother in a rural village – previously without any bank access – can receive payments or remittances on her phone and participate in the economy. The motivation was clear: “help the 70% of Salvadorans who are unbanked” by allowing anyone with a phone to transact . This bold step has turned El Salvador into a living laboratory for financial inclusion, inspiring other countries to explore Bitcoin for the same reason. Bitcoin is economic empowerment. It democratizes finance, giving individuals control over their money regardless of status or location. From subsistence farmers in Africa to gig workers in Southeast Asia, people are downloading wallets and unlocking opportunities. They can save without fear of local bank failures, transact across borders, and access global markets directly. As the World Economic Forum noted, cryptocurrencies are building “open, democratic financial systems” that can include the 1.7 billion+ underbanked people through low-cost, automated services . In short, Bitcoin is banking the unbanked, igniting hope in communities long left on the margins. The world urgently needs this inclusive financial revolution to continue growing. 2. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: Protecting Wealth in Turbulent Times Around the world, families are watching their hard-earned savings melt away as inflation soars. In these trying times, Bitcoin shines as digital gold – a safe haven asset with a hard cap that governments cannot debase . Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million coins. This built-in scarcity makes it resistant to inflationary pressures and instills confidence that one’s savings won’t be eroded by central bank policies . As a result, more people are turning to Bitcoin as a store of value when traditional money falters. We see this vividly in countries suffering hyperinflation or currency collapse. In Venezuela, years of economic mismanagement led to one of history’s worst hyperinflations at over 1,000,000% . The Venezuelan bolívar became virtually worthless – but Bitcoin offered a lifeline. Venezuelans began converting their rapidly devaluing cash into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to preserve whatever value they could. By 2020, Venezuela ranked third globally on the crypto adoption index due to the sheer volume of bolívar-to-Bitcoin transactions . Everyday people used Bitcoin to protect wages from inflation, with bank deposits losing value “in weeks or even days” otherwise . As Reuters reported, in Venezuela “crypto has become a tool to send remittances, protect wages from inflation and help businesses manage cash flow in a depreciating currency” . In short, Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for many Venezuelans, acting as a palliative for economic disaster when nothing else was available. Argentina provides another compelling case. Long plagued by inflation, Argentina recently saw annual inflation spike above 100%, the highest in decades. In response, Argentinians have rushed into cryptocurrency as a hedge. By mid-2023 an estimated 5 million Argentines (over 10% of the population) were using crypto regularly . Data shows that as the Argentinian peso plunged, crypto purchases shot up, peaking when inflation crossed 100% for the first time in thirty years . Many people now take their paycheck and immediately convert it to Bitcoin or stablecoins to escape the peso’s loss in value . One local exchange executive explained, “We have really high inflation… That makes crypto a valuable option for saving” . For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers something their national currency cannot: trustworthy long-term value. It’s telling that even in a bear market for crypto, Argentina led Latin America in transaction volume precisely because of this need to survive hyperinflation . What makes Bitcoin so attractive in these scenarios is financial sovereignty. As Human Rights Foundation’s Alex Gladstein observed, if you hold Bitcoin in your own wallet, “governments can’t delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can’t hyperinflate you” . People living under double- or triple-digit inflation have discovered this truth firsthand. Bitcoin’s design guarantees that no central authority can erode its value by printing more. This provides an essential hedge, especially during hyperinflationary spirals when prices double in weeks and local currencies collapse. Even in more stable economies, the post-2020 era of stimulus and rising prices has woken people up: in the U.S. and Europe, investors increasingly view Bitcoin as “digital gold” to diversify portfolios and guard against the highest inflation in 40 years. Historical data show that interest in Bitcoin spikes during inflationary periods , reflecting its growing reputation as “a hedge against traditional market downturns” . By offering ordinary people a way to preserve wealth, Bitcoin is fulfilling one of its most important promises. Whether it’s a middle-class family in Turkey watching the lira crash, or a professional in Lebanon who saw banks freeze their accounts (and wished they’d held Bitcoin ), individuals are learning that Bitcoin can secure their financial future when local systems fail. In a very real sense, Bitcoin is hope: hope that one’s lifetime of savings can be saved from the silent theft of inflation. As more people recognize this, Bitcoin’s role as the 21st century store-of-value will only grow – a stabilizing force in an unstable world . 3. Cross-Border Payments and Remittances: Fast, Low-Cost Global Transfers Every year, migrant workers and families worldwide lose billions of dollars to high fees and slow processes when sending money across borders. Traditional remittance services often charge 5-10% per transaction and can take days to clear . For the people relying on these funds – often small amounts for food, education or medicine – those fees hurt the most. Bitcoin offers a game-changing alternative: near-instant, low-cost international transfers that can empower families and boost entire economies. Consider El Salvador again. Remittances from workers abroad make up a whopping 20% of El Salvador’s GDP , but much of that used to be skimmed off by money transmitters. By embracing Bitcoin, El Salvador aimed to dramatically cut remittance costs for its people. Using the government’s Chivo wallet or Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, Salvadorans can now receive money from the U.S. in seconds, with virtually no fees – a stark contrast to lining up at Western Union and paying hefty commissions . This means more money in the pockets of low-income families and rural communities. As President Bukele touted, a construction worker in California can send $100 back home and nearly the whole $100 arrives, rather than $85 after fees. Enabling direct Bitcoin remittances has been life-changing for households that depend on that extra cash for daily needs. It also exemplifies how Bitcoin makes global commerce more fair: it doesn’t discriminate between a bank transfer of $10 or $10,000, and it never takes a cut based on percentage. Across the globe, other countries are similarly leveraging Bitcoin and crypto for remittances. Mexico, one of the world’s largest remittance destinations, has seen a surge in crypto-fueled transfers. In 2022, the exchange Bitso processed over $3.3 billion in remittances from the US to Mexico via crypto, about 5.4% of total flows . That 5% share – achieved in just a few years – translated into millions of dollars saved in fees for Mexican families. Importantly, these Bitcoin-based remittances arrive in minutes rather than days, and receivers in Mexico’s villages can convert to pesos or keep Bitcoin as they choose. The convenience and speed are a game changer. It’s no wonder that other Latin American countries with large U.S. diasporas (like Guatemala or Honduras) are exploring similar avenues, and companies like Strike are building Bitcoin Lightning solutions specifically to link U.S. earners with families back home in the developing world. In Africa, where remittance fees are the highest in the world, Bitcoin and stablecoins are truly transformative. Many Africans working abroad have shifted to sending money home via crypto because it can be 40-60% cheaper than using a traditional remittance corridor . For example, sending $200 in the legacy system might cost $20 or more in some African routes, whereas doing it with Bitcoin or a dollar-pegged crypto costs just a few dollars – and arrives the same day. Startups have sprouted across Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana to facilitate these transfers, often using Bitcoin’s network as the backbone beneath user-friendly apps. The result is that families can receive more of what their loved ones earn, helping pay for schooling, healthcare, and local business investments. But remittances are only part of the story. Cross-border commerce and payments are also being revolutionized by Bitcoin’s network. Small exporters and freelancers in countries with restrictive banking can now get paid directly in Bitcoin from international clients, sidestepping delays of wire transfers or unfair currency exchange rates. A designer in Lagos or a coder in Dhaka can offer their services globally and receive value in minutes, opening up opportunities previously blocked by banking friction. Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a secondary layer for instant micropayments, has further enabled things like pay-as-you-go services, streaming money for content, and tipping creators across borders with negligible fees. These innovations point to a future where sending money is as easy as sending an email – a future Bitcoin is actively creating today. The world urgently needs faster, fairer payments, and Bitcoin is delivering. By stripping away the artificial barriers and tolls in the legacy system, Bitcoin lets migrants support their families more effectively and lets value flow to where it’s needed most. It’s profoundly inspiring to see a grandmother in the Philippines receive a Lightning payment on her phone from her grandson overseas, or a community in Senegal fund a well via global Bitcoin donations, all with minimal overhead. This is financial connectivity as it should be: inclusive, efficient, and empowering. As more people discover how easily and cheaply they can transact globally with Bitcoin, the pressure will mount on old remittance providers to lower costs – a positive force Bitcoin has already set in motion. 4. Political and Social Empowerment: Sovereignty Under Authoritarian Regimes Imagine living under a regime that controls every aspect of your life – even your ability to access money. In many authoritarian and crisis-hit countries, people face financial repression: frozen bank accounts, capital controls, surveillance of transactions, and the ever-present threat of asset seizure. Here, Bitcoin’s value is not just financial – it’s profoundly human. Bitcoin provides a form of money that no dictator can easily control, giving dissidents, activists, and ordinary citizens a tool to reclaim their freedom. As one activist put it, “Bitcoin is bad for dictators”, because it’s money that empowers the people . Time and again, when repressive governments have tried to cut off their citizens from resources, Bitcoin has ridden to the rescue. In Nigeria, during the 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality, authorities froze the bank accounts of activists to stifle the movement . But young protesters quickly turned to Bitcoin for fundraising after seeing their local currency access blocked. Within days, Bitcoin donations from around the world were keeping the protests alive, paying for food, medical supplies and legal aid – all beyond the government’s reach. Nigeria’s youth effectively said: “If the banks won’t let us raise money for justice, we’ll use Bitcoin, which no one can censor.” This marked one of the first major instances where a social movement was funded by cryptocurrency out of necessity, showcasing Bitcoin’s power as censorship-resistant money. Even as the government tried to clamp down (at one point even ordering crypto accounts frozen), organizers kept routing funds through Bitcoin until their voices were heard. In Belarus and Russia, opposition groups and journalists have similarly leaned on Bitcoin to survive crackdowns. When authoritarian regimes blacklist dissident organizations from financial services, they assume they can starve them out. But with Bitcoin, an independent media outlet or an NGO can keep operating, paying contributors and receiving support from abroad, without a single bank having to approve. Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation notes that “so many people…have essentially been saved or rescued because of this technology” . His organization started recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as early as 2013, when Ukrainian protesters in Kyiv faced bank freezes and found that Bitcoin could still get funds to them on the ground . In his words, “Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful tool against authoritarian control”, offering ordinary people an alternative when regimes would otherwise trap or devalue their money . No story illustrates this better than that of Venezuela’s medical workers in 2020. Amidst economic collapse and COVID-19, Venezuela’s authoritarian government was blocking aid money for doctors and nurses – refusing assistance for political reasons while these frontline workers earned just a few dollars a month. The opposition-led team found a clever solution: they used cryptocurrency to bypass the regime and deliver aid directly. They set up Bitcoin (and stablecoin) wallets for thousands of healthcare workers. Funds from international donors were sent to these wallets, and trusted community members (termed “human ATMs”) helped the recipients convert to usable local currency . This Bitcoin-fueled aid program succeeded in getting $100 per month to 65,000 desperate doctors and nurses – an absolute lifeline when the average salary had plunged to just $5 . The government could neither intercept nor stop this relief, as it was happening on a decentralized network outside their control. Think about that: tens of thousands of families were sustained because Bitcoin enabled humanitarian aid without borders. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s potential as a weapon against oppression, delivering hope where conventional channels failed. Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and self-custody mean that you and you alone control your money. If you hold your own Bitcoin keys, no bank, no court, not even a superpower can freeze your account or block a transaction. For people in Hong Kong, Iran, Afghanistan, and other repressive environments, this is incredibly empowering. It means a journalist can escape their country with their savings intact on a USB drive or memorized seed phrase – whereas carrying cash or gold would get confiscated at the border. It means a refugee can receive support directly from supporters worldwide, even if the local regime wants to choke them off. And it means communities can build a degree of economic autonomy, using Bitcoin in local circular economies, that lets them endure sanctions or financial blockades. As Gladstein has bluntly stated, Bitcoin strips authoritarians of a key lever of control. “With Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to [financially] manipulate and control people is completely decimated,” he explains . A government can’t inflate away your wealth if it’s in Bitcoin, and they can’t freeze what they can’t find the keys to. Indeed, “no government or bank can freeze your bitcoin or restrict access to it”, as one Lebanese survivor of hyperinflation observed – and that could have saved many in his country’s collapse . This is why Bitcoin is increasingly called “freedom money”. It is giving people an exit door from tyrannical systems. Each time an oppressed individual opts out of the state-controlled currency, they reclaim a bit of power over their own life. We should be clear: Bitcoin alone won’t topple dictators overnight. But it evens the playing field by denying dictators total financial dominance. It provides a plan B for those bravely working for change – a way to sustain themselves and their missions when traditional means are cut off. This has a profound psychological impact too: just knowing there is an alternative builds resilience. In the words of one Togolese activist, people in autocracies turn to Bitcoin because “it helps bypass financial repression” and gives them hope for a more free future . By empowering civil society and weakening the grip of repressive governments over finances, Bitcoin is quietly fueling a revolution in human rights. The world needs this “money of freedom” today, because so many are still fighting for their basic dignity under harsh regimes. Bitcoin is their ally – our ally – in the timeless struggle for liberty. 5. Technological Innovation and Decentralization: A New Era of Trust and Opportunity Bitcoin isn’t just changing finance; Bitcoin is changing the world by introducing a revolutionary model of trust through technology. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network in 2009, few understood that this was the dawn of a new era – the era of decentralized innovation. Today, we recognize Bitcoin as the foundation of a global shift: a shift towards systems that are open, transparent, and not reliant on any single authority. This technological paradigm is unleashing creativity and economic opportunity on a scale reminiscent of the early internet. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Bitcoin sparked the Fourth Industrial Revolution in finance, one centered on decentralization and digital scarcity. At its core, Bitcoin solved a problem long thought impossible: it created digital scarcity. For the first time, there was a digital asset that could not be copied endlessly, that people could trust to hold value like a physical commodity. This breakthrough – “the birth of digital scarcity” – underpins Bitcoin’s value . With a hard limit of 21 million coins, Bitcoin established a reliable, programmatic monetary policy that anyone in the world can verify. This scarcity, combined with robust security, means Bitcoin can serve as a foundation for wealth creation and preservation in the digital age . It has inspired an entire ecosystem of innovation: thousands of cryptocurrencies, smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, and more – all tracing their lineage back to Bitcoin’s fundamental breakthroughs. Yet Bitcoin remains unique and irreplaceable, the most secure and widely adopted of them all . As an OSL research piece put it, Bitcoin’s “unique properties, such as scarcity, decentralization, and security, contribute to its status as a digital asset that cannot be replicated.” Decentralization is the beating heart of Bitcoin’s technology. By operating on a global network of tens of thousands of nodes and miners, Bitcoin eliminates the need for any middleman or central server . Transactions are verified by the consensus of the network participants, not by trusting a bank or government. This has enormous implications. It means the Bitcoin network is extraordinarily resilient – there’s no single point of failure that could bring it down . It means transparency – every transaction is recorded on an open ledger (the blockchain) that anyone can examine, reducing the chance of fraud. And it means empowerment – “it empowers individuals by giving them control over their own funds,” free from the fees and whims of intermediaries . In practical terms, a farmer in India can trade with a developer in France and a designer in Brazil directly, with each party trusting the math and the network, not having to know or trust each other beforehand. This trustless transaction capability is revolutionary; it removes friction and fosters a new era of global commerce and collaboration. Bitcoin’s decentralized design also drives security and immutability. The network is secured by advanced cryptography and a proof-of-work mechanism that makes altering confirmed transactions virtually impossible . Unlike centralized databases that hackers often breach, Bitcoin’s blockchain has never been compromised in its history. Once a transaction is settled in a block, it cannot be changed or erased . This gives users an unprecedented level of confidence in the integrity of their money. Funds can’t just vanish because of a bank’s error or a government’s whim – the Bitcoin ledger is ironclad. Each additional participant and each additional use case only strengthens the network (through what’s known as the network effect): as more people use Bitcoin, it becomes more valuable and useful, which attracts yet more users in a virtuous cycle . Already Bitcoin has the largest, most battle-tested computing network on Earth securing it, making it one of the most secure assets ever devised. This level of security is what allows Bitcoin to function as digital cash and digital gold simultaneously. And as the network grows, we see more businesses and even nations exploring it, knowing that they can plug into a financial protocol that is robust and globally accessible. Beyond Bitcoin itself, the innovations spurred by Bitcoin’s principles are reshaping technology and finance. The rise of the Lightning Network, for instance, has made Bitcoin payments ultra-fast and scalable, enabling a wave of creativity in micropayments and small-value use cases. In 2025, the Lightning Network reached new heights, reportedly processing over 100 million transactions in a single quarter as adoption accelerated . This layer-2 solution allows people to send tiny fractions of a cent instantly – something not feasible with traditional payment rails – which is opening up possibilities like pay-per-stream content, micro-tipping for social media posts, and machine-to-machine payments in the Internet of Things. As Lightning and similar technologies mature, Bitcoin is evolving from just a store of value to a full-fledged payments and innovation platform. Crucially, Bitcoin has catalyzed a movement towards decentralized governance and open-source development in finance. It proved that a community of globally distributed contributors can maintain and upgrade a monetary system without any CEO or central authority. This is inspiring new governance models in other domains (think decentralized autonomous organizations for everything from art to insurance). In essence, Bitcoin taught the world that trust can be built into code – and that people anywhere can cooperate to run critical infrastructure (like money) by consensus. The cultural impact of this cannot be overstated: “Bitcoin serves as a symbol of resistance against centralized control and government overreach”, representing a vision of a future where financial freedom and sovereignty are accessible to all . It has ignited the imagination of millions – engineers, economists, futurists – who are now pushing the boundaries of what decentralized tech can do, from reinventing banking to creating new social networks free of censorship. The world needs Bitcoin’s innovative spirit urgently. Traditional financial systems, with their siloed ledgers and 20th-century technology, struggle to keep pace with today’s digital economy. Bitcoin and the technologies it birthed offer a leap forward, much like the internet did for information. They promise financial services that are more efficient, more inclusive, and more secure. They also promise new economic models that reward participation and merit over privilege and monopoly. We are already seeing early glimpses: developing nations using Bitcoin to stabilize their economies, tech startups building on Bitcoin to bank the unbanked, and even forward-thinking governments crafting laws to accommodate this innovation rather than stifle it. By embracing Bitcoin’s decentralized paradigm, societies can unleash entrepreneurship and give individuals greater agency in the economic realm. This is a positive-sum game – one where everyone can benefit from a more open and innovative financial system. At a time when trust in institutions is low, Bitcoin offers a trust in technology as an alternative, and it’s proving to be trust well-placed. The momentum of Bitcoin’s technological revolution is unstoppable, and joining it means stepping into the future of finance with optimism and confidence. 6. Global Relevance: A Worldwide Movement from Developing Villages to Developed Cities Bitcoin’s impact and adoption are not confined to one type of economy or one region – it is a global phenomenon, touching lives in developing countries and developed capitals alike. What’s truly inspiring is how Bitcoin means different things to different people, yet it brings them together under one monetary network. In struggling economies, it’s a lifeline and an equalizer. In wealthier nations, it’s an agent of change and a hedge for the future. Across continents, a diverse tapestry of Bitcoin use cases is emerging, proving that this technology is broadly relevant and adaptable to local needs. Below is a snapshot of key regions embracing Bitcoin today, and the primary drivers behind their adoption: Table: Key Regions Adopting Bitcoin and Their Drivers of Adoption Sources: Adoption data from Chainalysis and national reports ; inflation and unbanked stats from World Bank, IMF, and local sources . As the table illustrates, Bitcoin’s appeal is truly global and multifaceted. A rural villager in Kenya might cherish Bitcoin for giving her a safe savings vehicle outside any bank. A software engineer in San Francisco might value Bitcoin as an investment and a statement of support for open technology. A shopkeeper in Turkey could accept Bitcoin from tourists to avoid the lira’s volatility, while a college student in Ukraine might use Bitcoin donations to fund relief efforts during a crisis . In each case, Bitcoin is solving a problem or enhancing lives in ways that weren’t possible before. It’s particularly noteworthy how Bitcoin adoption often surges in response to crises or limitations of the traditional system. In Lebanon’s recent financial meltdown, for instance, when banks imposed strict withdrawal limits and the local currency crashed, interest in Bitcoin surged as a lifeline . People realized that had they held savings in Bitcoin, no bank could have prevented them from accessing their money, and the value wouldn’t have been tied to Lebanon’s failing policies . Similarly, during currency scares in Turkey and Nigeria, Bitcoin trading volumes hit all-time highs as people scrambled for stability. These aren’t speculative manias – they’re signs of urgent need. When trust in government money falters, Bitcoin stands in the gap. And even in stable countries, events like bank failures (for example, the 2023 U.S. regional bank crisis) or concerns about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privacy have driven more people to hold Bitcoin as a sovereign money option just in case. It’s a grassroots insurance policy that’s catching on everywhere. Perhaps one of the most uplifting aspects of Bitcoin’s global rise is the sense of unity and community it fosters. Bitcoin has built a global network of advocates and educators crossing all cultural and political lines. A farmer in rural India and a banker in New York might have little in common – until they start discussing Bitcoin, and suddenly they share this vision of a more open financial future. Conferences, meetups, and online forums brim with enthusiastic collaboration – developers improving the technology, economists debating its impact, ordinary people sharing stories of how Bitcoin changed their lives. This bottom-up energy is contagious. It’s turning Bitcoin from just a currency into a global movement for financial empowerment. We see governments starting to pay attention (and some, like El Salvador, taking bold steps), largely because they realize this is driven by people’s genuine needs and aspirations. In summary, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, São Paulo to Stockholm, Bitcoin is proving its relevance. It adapts to local contexts: serving as a currency here, a store of value there, and a network for innovation everywhere. The world has never had a truly global, people-powered financial system before – and now it does in Bitcoin. This universality is why the world needs Bitcoin now. It is the common thread of financial hope running through so many disparate struggles and dreams on our planet today. Conclusion: A Hopeful Future with Bitcoin In this moment of global challenge and change, Bitcoin rises as a beacon of hope and a tool for empowerment. It offers a path toward greater economic freedom, where anyone can participate in finance without permission or prejudice. It offers relief from the silent theft of inflation, giving ordinary people a way to safeguard their life’s work. It tears down costly barriers in moving money, reuniting families with more of their hard-earned wages. It strengthens those who dare to speak out against tyranny, ensuring their voices can’t be silenced by freezing their funds. It pioneers a radical new trust model – one rooted in math and consensus rather than fallible institutions – unleashing innovation and inspiring collaboration worldwide. And it does all of this through a single, open network that welcomes every citizen of the world. The urgency cannot be overstated. As we’ve seen, people are using Bitcoin today to overcome real hardships – feeding their families in inflation-ravaged countries, raising funds for noble causes, or simply accessing opportunities long denied to them. The status quo has left too many behind and let too many down. Now, Bitcoin gives us a chance to course-correct – to build a fairer, more inclusive global financial system from the ground up. It is not controlled by the powerful; it is owned by all who use it. In Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos, we glimpse a future where technology empowers the many, not the few. This report has laid out why the world needs Bitcoin now more than ever, but the truth is even simpler: the world needs hope, the world needs freedom – and Bitcoin is delivering both. From a young woman in Latin America finally able to save for her education, to a father in Africa sending money home without extortionate fees, to an entrepreneur in Asia launching a startup via global crowdfunding, Bitcoin is lighting up lives with new possibilities. It instills a sense of optimism and agency – the feeling that yes, we can take control of our financial destiny. That energy is infectious and unstoppable. We stand at a crossroads in history. Down one path, we stick with old financial structures that are creaking under their own weight, often exclusionary and prone to crisis. Down another path, we embrace the Bitcoin-led revolution – an open, resilient, people-centric financial future. The choice is becoming clearer by the day. Around the world, millions have already chosen Bitcoin as their lifeline and their inspiration. They chose it because it answered a deep need that nothing else could. Now is the time for all of us – individuals, communities, and forward-thinking leaders – to recognize this urgent call. Bitcoin is here to stay, and its positive impact is only growing. By championing Bitcoin and the ethos it represents, we champion a world of greater justice and opportunity. As the examples and data have shown, this is not theoretical; it is happening right now. The world needs Bitcoin, today, to continue breaking down barriers and uplifting those in need. If we seize this moment, we can usher in a brighter, more inclusive era of human prosperity. In the powerful words of one Bitcoiner, “Bitcoin isn’t just money – it’s hope.” Let us embrace that hope. The world needs Bitcoin, and together we can carry this torch of freedom forward, energized and united by the promise of a better tomorrow. ₿LOG ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

I spent the first three months of my life in a contested space: Temple Hill in Blackrock, Dublin, commonly known as St Patrick’s Infant and Dietetic Hospital. It is contested because there is a fundamental disagreement as to its historical purpose: there are two different retrospective interpretations of its function. To this day the Government insists that it was a hospital; but in reality, it was an adoption home for infants and babies. It was stated in a parliamentary question in the Dáil by Sinn Féin TD Claire Kerrane last year that: “Temple Hill does not qualify for supports, redress or recognition because it was a hospital, yet babies were adopted and paid for on foot of newspaper advertisements. Many children went to America. I have never heard of a hospital that does that.” Despite the indisputable fact that many children were adopted from Temple Hill through the former adoption society St Patrick’s Guild, and some were resident for lengthy periods of time, it is one of at least four institutions excluded from the Mother and Baby Institutions payment scheme as it was not on the initial list of homes investigated by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. The fact that it was not an institution within the meaning of the terms of the commission and no mothers resided there with their babies (apparently they were taken from them at the door) kept it out of its terms of reference. I am not seeking a payment under the scheme or looking for redress personally, because I left Temple Hill with my adoptive parents at the age of three months. I was fortunate to grow up with six siblings – five adopted, also from the same location – in a stimulating and supportive environment, but I am advocating for people who have been left out. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has stated that the official commission report was flawed because many institutions were excluded. Its remit was too narrow. In an “alternative report”, a team including survivors, activists and eminent academics wrote that its “text excluded significant cohorts of affected people” and that “it is regrettable that the Commission did not request to modify its terms of reference to permit deep engagement with a wider range of organisations”. Minister for Children, Disability and Equality Norma Foley will have a chance to review the operation of the scheme within six months of its second anniversary, by September 2026. Many of the now-ageing adults who were resident and abused in institutions and identify themselves as “survivors” in need of the supports offered by the scheme are currently left in limbo. I had the pleasure of meeting the Irish artist Bernard Canavan, a recipient of the prestigious Presidential Award for his contribution to Irish culture in the UK at the Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith, London. He recently held an exhibition at The United Arts Club in Dublin entitled Theocracy. His paintings represent the trauma that he and others endured in institutions. He was a long-term resident of the same Temple Hill in Blackrock, more than 25 years before me. Despite evidence of his abuse, neglect, lengthy period of residency at Temple Hill, and his advanced age, he is excluded from the payment scheme because of “contested” definitions. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has set up a comprehensive curriculum resource on “mother and baby homes” for the Junior Cycle. It developed it in collaboration with groups involved in advocating for survivors of “historic” institutions. This is an important and worthwhile initiative. The list of related literature for the English curriculum is comprehensive and impressive, including the novel Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan and the play An Trial by Máiréad Ní Ghráda. The curriculum has input from many survivors and is all the better for it. However, the framing of the curriculum comes directly from the NCCA, a statutory body of the Department of Education. At the launch, Minister for Education Helen McEntee said: “It is vital that our young people learn about the history of this State in every aspect, and in order to provide this teaching and learning, teachers must be supported with resources such as this one.” One of the resources for Junior Cycle teachers - a series of slides, maps, a list of the homes included in the Commission’s report - omits the contested homes. Much of the lengthy reading list that goes with the teacher supports comprises “official” reports. Searching through the voluminous reading list, I eventually found an alternative “List of Institutions, Agencies and Personnel Involved in Separating Unmarried Mothers from their Children.” It is collated by Claire McGettrick and the Justice for Magdalenes Research and Adoption Rights Alliance. The database includes St Patrick’s Infant Dietetic Hospital (aka Temple Hill). It is vital that students understand how our Government and legal system operates to include and exclude people from access to justice. These nuances matter. If school children are taught to think critically they might be driven to question as to whether their history curriculum is in fact “history” or “current affairs”? In Fintan O’Toole’s excellent recent article on the excavation of the Tuam site, he writes that: “This is making history in a double sense – doing something that has never been done before while simultaneously reshaping a country’s understanding of its own recent past. And, hopefully, of its present.” It seems ironic that the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four has been removed from the Senior Cycle curriculum for 2026 by the Department of Education, while Greta Gerwig’s film Barbie has been deemed worthy of inclusion. Leaving Certificate students won’t have to read George Orwell’s text or consider one of its most memorable lines: “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.” But they will have a chance to consider this dialogue by Weird Barbie: “That Ken of yours, he is one nice looking little protein pot … I’d like to see what kind of nude blob he’s packing under those jeans.” Rachel Fehily is a barrister, lecturer in literature and justice at UCD and is engaged in interdisciplinary creative-based doctoral studies supported by Research Ireland © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The best restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to

The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Read our full review here. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. Read our full review here. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. Read our full review here. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. Read our full review here. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. Read our full review here. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. Read our full review here. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Naysayer Vanguard Makes Bold Bet On Strategy Stock–Details

In a twist that few saw coming, Vanguard has quietly become the top shareholder in Strategy (MSTR). The $10 trillion asset manager now owns just over 20 million MSTR shares. That adds up to nearly 8% of Strategy’s Class A stock. Vanguard once warned that Bitcoin was “immature” and carried “no inherent economic value.” Now it finds itself deeply tied to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin play. According to a Bloomberg report, Vanguard didn’t set out to back Saylor’s moves. It simply follows its index‑fund rules. When Strategy’s stock climbed, it grew larger in the indexes that the company tracks. The result: Vanguard had to buy more shares. Through its broad‑market funds, the asset manager ended up with a stake worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It shows how passive strategies can lead to active positions in unexpected places. Vanguard’s CEO Tim Buckley once said that Bitcoin “could wreak havoc on portfolios.” He argued that the flagship crypto lacked the history and solid ground that long‑term investors need. Yet Vanguard’s own track record of following index weights means it can’t shy away from a stock that’s on the rise. No matter the fund’s view on Bitcoin, the rules forced its hand. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC. Each share of MSTR represents a slice of that giant pile of Bitcoin. For anyone holding Vanguard’s indexes, that means indirect exposure to more than half a million coins. Since 2020, MSTR stock has climbed around 3,400%. That surge helped push the firm’s market value up fast enough to land in Vanguard’s top holdings. Large investors often use ETFs or purpose‑built products to get Bitcoin exposure. Vanguard could have joined the likes of BlackRock in launching a spot Bitcoin ETF. But it declined. Instead, it finds itself holding a big chunk of Strategy. That makes it an unwitting part of the Bitcoin story, even if it wasn’t the path the firm’s managers originally chose. The fact that Vanguard is now the largest shareholder of $MSTR is proof that God has a sense of humor, or at least that was my reaction to @VildanaHajric who wrote story about it out today pic.twitter.com/TLg4iqT3kQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 14, 2025 Michael Saylor sees this as a sign that institutions are coming around to Bitcoin. He told Bloomberg that Vanguard’s stake is “a powerful signal” of acceptance. For years, many big firms treated Bitcoin as a niche asset. Now they’re tied to its fortunes through Strategy’s public shares. That shift may encourage others to take a closer look. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas summed up the irony on X, saying “God has a sense of humor.” He pointed out that Vanguard’s index approach means it must own all the stocks in its benchmarks—whether it likes them or not.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed after June CPI report

Wednesday, 16 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as investors digested fresh inflation data and a wave of earnings reports from major financial institutions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points, or 0.98 percent, to close at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 fell 24.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,243.76. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite rose 37.47 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,677.8, marking a new all-time closing high. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closed in the red. Materials and health care were the biggest decliners, falling 2.11 percent and 1.88 percent, respectively. Technology was the only sector to finish higher, gaining 1.27 percent. June's inflation data, released Tuesday, showed consumer prices rising 0.3 percent for the month, in line with expectations and up from May's pace. The annual CPI rate stood at 2.7 percent. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, climbed 0.2 percent from the previous month and 2.9 percent year over year, both matching analysts' forecasts. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report come in line with expectations, but "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming." "The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy. On the earnings front, several major banks delivered underwhelming results. Wells Fargo beat profit expectations but issued lower guidance for net interest income, pushing its shares down more than 5 percent. JPMorgan Chase also posted strong results but saw its shares slip. BlackRock dropped 5.88 percent after missing revenue estimates. Citigroup stood out, gaining 3.68 percent after beating second-quarter earnings expectations. In the tech sector, Nvidia surged 4.04 percent after announcing it would resume shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, following White House assurances that current export restrictions would be eased. The news sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 6.41 percent, Arm Holdings and Broadcom each added less than 2 percent, and the iShares Semiconductor ETF climbed 1 percent. Among other mega-cap tech names, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon posted modest advances. Tesla declined 1.93 percent, and Meta Platforms lost 1.46 percent. Thank you for your report!

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

Title: Rise of Zohran Mamdani has Wall Street giving up on Gotham

The NYC Partnership threw a party — but no one really showed up. A who’s who of the New York City business community were no shows for a Tuesday meet and greet session with socialist democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nations largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nations second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation. Those sentiments were pretty universal among according to sources at the banks of the CEOs who didn’t attend. There was once a time that CEOs of this caliber would want to meet the likely next mayor of the city. Now, it’s resignation — a bet that New York City is a lost cause, and a belief that the Partnership, run by the retiring Kathy Wylde, is an increasingly impotent advocate to turn back the increasingly leftist political class. Most business leaders I know are looking for an exit strategy rather than a strategy to deal with a mayor Mamdani. Yes, they want the current mayor Eric Adams to stick around — ethical warts and all — because he’s the devil they know and they like his very competent police commissioner, Jessica Tisch. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But Adams faces an uphill climb, all the more so because Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the primary, is leading what they see as a Quixotic run as an independent. Curtis Sliwa, the GOP nominee, is going nowhere fast. The polls, for now, show a likely Mamdani mayoralty, combined with a leftist city council and a state government that veers nearly as far left as Zohran. All which spells disaster for those businesses who stay: Police defunding, higher taxes and government takeover of businesses like supermarkets. And that gets us to why there were so many no shows Tuesday: the city’s business community doesn’t have to stay. If you follow these big firms, as I do, you know they employ hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers — but fewer and fewer in recent years. The harsh COVID lockdowns here gave them the excuse to move operations to places with lower taxes and regulations, mainly Florida and Texas, but also Utah and even Tennessee. Mamdani will be another reason for the big banks to finally say goodbye to Gotham.

Title: Disabled children suffered higher rates of sexual abuse, Dáil hears during debate on historical abuse

Children with disabilities experienced sexual abuse at a much higher rate than children without a disability, the Dáil heard as it debated historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. Minister of State for Special Education and Inclusion Michael Moynihan said the scoping inquiry leading to the newly established Commission of Investigation revealed the records of religious orders showed “some 528 allegations of historical child sexual abuse across 17 special schools in respect of 190 alleged abusers”. The initial scoping inquiry was told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. It was told it involved 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools countrywide between 1927 to 2013. The Minister of State said “many families entrusted the care of their children into these communities” and “this is unlikely to be the full extent of the historical abuse in special schools”. It was “truly appalling that the additional vulnerabilities of children in special schools could be so exploited and there has to be accountability”, Mr Moynihan said. He was speaking during a debate on the motion to approve the draft order on the Commission of Investigation on the handling of historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. [ Government will ‘pursue all levers’ to make religious orders pay redress to victims of school sex abuseOpens in new window ] Sinn Féin TD Pat Buckley said he had lost many friends who had been abused and it took more than 20 years to find out what happened. “I lost two friends in primary school where the abuse started and I wasn’t aware of it.” He said “people ran away from school, came back, qualified as solicitors and everything, and unfortunately ended their lives”. He said some of the people who are responsible “are still alive, some of the principals and vice-principals, Christian Brothers and lay teachers”. Labour’s Ciarán Ahern said the Government and other institutions of power “have excelled in the past at covering up the reality of child sexual abuse”. “We need only look at the Carrigan report in 1931 to see the DNA of denial that blighted child protection in Ireland from the State’s foundation”. The Dublin South-West TD said the Carrigan committee was appointed in 1930 and held 17 sessions. One witness, the police commissioner of the time, “highlighted an alarming amount of sexual crime, increasing yearly, a feature of which was the large number of cases of criminal interference with girls and children from 16 years and downwards, many children under 10 years of age”. He said the police commissioner believed that less than 15 per cent of sexual crime was being prosecuted but government chose not to publish the report. Minister for Education Helen McEntee thanked “every single survivor for their bravery, whether they were in a position to come forward or not”. She also thanked the late Mark Ryan and his brother David who came forward for the RTÉ documentary Blackrock Boys, after which the Government established a scoping inquiry. In an address to survivors she said: “I am truly sorry for what was done to you and the devastating impacts it had on your lives, but I want to thank each and every person for their bravery.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis Get the Inside Politics newsletter for a behind-the-scenes take on events of the day Marie O’Halloran is Parliamentary Correspondent of The Irish Times Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

World The logo for J.P.Morgan appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, May 1, 2025. (Photo: AP/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK: The Nasdaq Composite posted a fresh record close on Tuesday (Jul 15), lifted by a surge in shares of Nvidia, even as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones slipped amid lukewarm inflation data and mixed bank earnings. It was the tech-heavy index's fourth record close in five sessions, and its eighth since Jun 27. Artificial-intelligence chip leader Nvidia gained 4 per cent after it unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China. The news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both gaining more than 6.4 per cent. The semiconductor index also advanced 1.3 per cent to its highest point in a year, while the S&P technology index climbed by the same percentage to hit a record high. "The Nvidia news meant that some investors, who had moved into other stocks due to high tech valuations, were rotating back," said Rob Swanke, senior investment research analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network. "I would probably say it's a one-day pop," he added, noting that investors would look to see the sales reflected in upcoming earnings. The Nasdaq Composite added 37.47 points or 0.18 per cent to end at 20,677.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points or 0.98 per cent to 44,023.29, and the S&P 500 lost 24.80 points or 0.40 per cent to 6,243.76. Markets have been buoyant in recent weeks as concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policies eased. However, this week is seen as a key test, with second-quarter earnings and inflation data in focus. US consumer prices posted their largest gain in five months in June, suggesting tariffs may be contributing to rising costs. Still, underlying inflation remained moderate, offering investors some relief. "The picture from inflation this morning, coming in a little bit higher than expected but pretty much in line, gives you some sense that the tariffs are starting to flow through into the economy," said Commonwealth's Swanke. "We'll get more concrete news, as we go through earnings, to see how companies are delivering the impact of higher tariffs." The second-quarter earnings season opened on a muted note. JPMorgan Chase slipped 0.7 per cent despite raising its 2025 net interest income outlook, while Wells Fargo fell 5.5 per cent even as its profit improved due to reduced loan-loss reserves. BlackRock reported a new milestone in assets under management, but its shares slid 5.9 per cent. Citigroup bucked the trend, climbing 3.7 per cent to its highest finish since the global financial crisis, after its trading division delivered a strong performance that lifted second-quarter profits. The number of shares changing hands on US exchanges on Tuesday was 16.82 billion, compared with the 17.55 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

Title: Is Ethereum’s $3K rejection a spark for ETH’s next breakout?

Time Published: 2025-07-15T20:00:13Z

Ethereum’s dip might be less a setback and more a springboard. Ethereum just saw a 2% dip and heavy liquidations, yet Open Interest and ETF inflows suggest strong underlying conviction. BlackRock alone added 50,970 ETH as capital quietly rotates from Bitcoin. Ethereum [ETH] just took a 2% hit and got rejected hard at a key resistance level, and suddenly $3,000 is looking more like a local top than a launchpad. In fact, that drop wiped out $82.28 million in longs, nearly 80% of the day’s liquidations. And there’s still $47 million hanging by a thread, ready to go with even a minor dip. Typically, you’d expect a deeper flush in Open Interest (OI) after that kind of leverage reset. But interestingly, OI has barely budged, down just 0.55% from its record $43.94 billion the day before. Source: CryptoQuant Zoom out a bit, and the setup feels familiar. Back then, Ethereum’s OI held steady through a tight consolidation zone between $2,640 and $2,450. The result? A breakout rally that pushed ETH up 20% in under two weeks, alongside a fresh OI peak. Now, throw in another $260 million into spot ETH ETFs, bringing the total to nearly $1.1 billion over just four trading days, marking the strongest run since their launch last July. Put it all together: Futures positioning is holding strong, spot inflows are ramping. Clearly, someone’s leaning in while the broader market hesitates. Could this be a move the rest of the market hasn’t priced in yet? For the first time ever, Ethereum’s strategic reserves have crossed $4 billion, with 1.11% of the supply now concentrated in just 50 entities. BlackRock’s latest buy of 50,970 ETH worth $150 million only adds fuel to the narrative. And it might not be random timing. The ETH/BTC ratio has posted two straight green candles, hinting that as Bitcoin [BTC] struggles at resistance, capital could be quietly rotating into Ethereum. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) The divergence shows up in the data, too. Bitcoin’s Open Interest has dropped 3.72%, with the price now 5% off its $122k high. Meanwhile, ETH has kept its OI drawdown to just 2%, showing more stability under pressure.

World President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he leaves the White House, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Washington. (Photo: AP/Manuel Balce Ceneta) PITTSBURGH: US President Donald Trump will join executives from leading technology and energy firms at a high-profile summit in Pittsburgh on Tuesday (Jul 15), as the White House accelerates plans to boost artificial intelligence (AI) and expand data centre infrastructure. The Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, brings together top officials from Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, ExxonMobil and others, amid intensifying global competition with China over AI dominance. Trump is expected to announce some US$90 billion in AI and energy investments in Pennsylvania during the event, which was organized by US Senator Dave McCormick, a key Republican ally. The president will unveil commitments from major corporations including Google, CoreWeave, and Blackstone. McCormick told attendees the stakes "couldn’t be higher", warning that if the US failed to lead in AI, it could cede control over infrastructure and technology to Beijing. "We will hand control of our infrastructure, our data, our leadership and our way of life to the Chinese Communist Party," he said. Amid soaring demand, Big Tech companies are racing to secure enough power to run energy-intensive data centres. Google announced a US$3 billion deal to acquire up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower from Brookfield Asset Management. The 20-year power purchase agreements will support electricity generation at two facilities in Pennsylvania. Cloud service provider CoreWeave also announced plans for a US$6 billion AI data centre, while asset manager Blackstone committed US$25 billion to building data centres and energy infrastructure across the state. Other executives in attendance include Mubadala CEO Khaldoon Al-Mubarak, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, Bechtel CEO Brendan Bechtel and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. The White House is weighing executive actions in the coming weeks to ease infrastructure development for AI. These include simplifying connections between energy projects and the grid, allocating federal land for data centres, and creating a nationwide Clean Water Act permit to streamline approval for AI infrastructure. Trump, who has declared AI a top national priority, ordered the creation of a comprehensive AI Action Plan in January. The plan, developed with input from the National Security Council, is due by Jul 23. He is expected to mark the occasion with a major speech titled "Winning the AI Race", organised by White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks and co-hosts from the All-In podcast. The surge in AI activity is pushing US electricity consumption to record highs. To meet demand, energy companies and tech firms are striking new deals, such as a proposed plan by Microsoft and Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. This growing demand has sparked concerns about power shortages, rising electricity bills, and potential blackouts that could disrupt the tech sector’s momentum in its race with global competitors like China.

Jamie Dimon framed the decision as defensive, as fintech companies already design products that mimic checking accounts, payments networks, and loyalty platforms. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on a July 15 earnings call that the bank will launch products tied to stablecoins and its deposit coin as part of a broader payments strategy. As CNBC reported, Dimon said the firm “will be involved” in both formats to master the technology and protect market share. Dimon framed the decision as defensive. He said fintech companies already design products that mimic checking accounts, payments networks, and loyalty platforms. Furthermore, JPMorgan’s CEO added that the firm must engage rather than watch. Citigroup executives said during their call on the same day that the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” and sees immediate utility in tokenized deposits and digital‑asset custody. Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan has signaled similar intentions. Executives floated a joint effort through Early Warning Services, the consortium behind Zelle, although Dimon declined to confirm any collaboration plans, saying only that the bank weighs “all that.” Dimon’s remarks echo BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who told investors that the asset manager sees a “great untapped opportunity” in stablecoins for clients seeking digital access to Treasuries and other cash instruments. Fink cited the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill that aims to establish a federal framework for stablecoin issuance, adding that it could accelerate the adoption of stablecoins. Dimon remains critical of Bitcoin but views stablecoins as practical extensions of existing payment infrastructure. A retail‑facing stablecoin would broaden settlement options to a broader customer base and, once regulations permit, operate across multiple blockchains. Regulatory clarity motivates the shift. The House of Representatives plans a vote on the GENIUS Act later this week, and senators have signaled support for rules that slot stablecoin issuers under bank supervision. Furthermore, Dimon acknowledged that failing to act could allow non‑banks to capture cross‑border flows and merchant payments: “You know, these guys are very smart. They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that. And the way to be cognizant is to be involved.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Gardaí contacted over 950 times since school abuse appeal
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0715/1523688-historical-abuse-schools/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T18:32:27Z
Full Content:
Barry Lenihan Gardaí have been contacted more than 950 times since their appeal last September relating to historical sexual abuse at schools run by religious orders. The updated figure came as the Dáil debated plans for a Commission of Investigation into historical abuse in schools, first announced by Minister for Education Helen McEntee last Tuesday. David Ryan, who featured in the Blackrock Boys documentary which led to the Commission's ultimate announcement, was among those in the Dáil to witness the debate. Speaking on his way into Leinster House, Mr Ryan said he hoped survivors would get justice in the years ahead. He carried a framed picture of his late brother Mark - who featured in the same documentary - into the Houses of the Oireachtas with him. "It's a very momentous day for me. I wish Mark was with me as he would have been in his element to come in here. I thought this would never happen. It's sad and good at the same time, so I'm happy," Mr Ryan told RTÉ's Drivetime programme. "The last week has been a bit of rollercoaster since I heard what Minister McEntee was going to do. Other people can get their justice and they should be proud of themselves to come forward. It's frightening to find out how many people were abused in this country, it's just frightening," he said. Last September, a scoping inquiry found that there were 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse in relation to 308 schools recorded by the religious orders that ran the schools. The allegations were made about 884 distinct alleged abusers. The inquiry recommended last week's announcement of a Commission of Investigation. In a statement to RTÉ, An Garda Síochána said it had received over 950 contacts around historical sexual abuse at schools run by religious orders since the publication of the scoping inquiry. However, a spokesperson added how not all contacts could be acted upon. "An Garda Síochána (has) highlighted that while An Garda Síochána would endeavour to effectively deal with all contacts, there was likely to be limitations as to the action that could be taken in some cases due to matters such as unavailability of evidence over time or suspects and/or witnesses being deceased." Speaking in the Dáil, Ms McEntee reiterated plans to use all levers possible to ensure religious orders contribute to a planned redress scheme for survivors. She also commended those who have shared their stories to date and confirmed the Commission will commence work in the coming months. © RTÉ 2025.

European shares ended lower on Tuesday, dragged down by heavyweight financial and healthcare stocks as investors awaited news on a potential US-EU trade deal while assessing the latest US inflation data. DUBLIN The Iseq All-Share index ended the session narrowly in the black, up 0.06 per cent at 11,262.29, on Tuesday. Hotel group Dalata closed down 2.6 per cent to €6.37 after a Scandinavian consortium reached an agreement to buy the business for €1.4 billion.

AI-chip leader Nvidia was higher after unveiling plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China. Other chipmakers also advanced, including Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer. The gains led the technology sector to a record high. JPMorgan Chase slipped despite raising its 2025 net interest income outlook, while Wells Fargo fell even as its profit rose on reduced loan-loss reserves. BlackRock notched a new milestone, managing a record $12.53 trillion in assets amid optimism over trade deals and rate cuts, yet its shares were also weaker. The KBW Bank Index sank to a two-week low, but Citigroup bucked the trend by climbing after its traders delivered a windfall that boosted second-quarter profits. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: How Texas Bullied Big Banks Into Dropping Their Climate Commitments

By Lauren Windsor Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave “the inside story” about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America’s biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. The official spoke in January at the exclusive Consumers’ Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event. Brent Webster, the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, recalled how his office moved to cut off lucrative bond business to Wells Fargo. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor’s mansion with Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton, and the bank’s execs, told the bank Texas could “reinstate the bond market” if it left the Net Zero Banking Alliance. When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank’s executives they were this close “to being sued right now.” After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, “you guys might be next.” It worked: “They left a week later,” he said. “They left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and then all the banks followed.” On the plus side for the banks, once they left the alliance, Paxton allowed them to get municipal bond business again. Paxton’s office did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment. In a statement, Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is “appalled at the lengths that Wall Street’s financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,” adding that “we are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton’s office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. If big banks and asset managers like BlackRock think that they can intimidate those who oppose their misdeeds into silence … they are mistaken.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Consumers’ Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. The organization and Leo have worked in coalition with Republican attorneys general, state financial officers, legislators, and national Republican groups to pressure businesses to drop public commitments to ensuring the future habitability of our planet. Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives’ “war on woke.” Of course, corporate climate pledges, like the one from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and ESG were nowhere close to solving the global climate crisis. The banks never stopped funding the fossil fuel industry. That hasn’t stopped conservatives — ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests — from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action. Related Content Barack and Michelle Obama Laugh Off Divorce Rumors Inside Trump's Frantic, Failing Mission to Crush the Epstein 'MAGA Rebellion' Trump Attacks His Supporters for Caring About ‘Bullshit’ Epstein Files Jordan Klepper Charts Trump’s Long History With Jeffrey Epstein on ‘The Daily Show’ Webster made clear how easy it is to weaponize the legal apparatus of the state to bring the financial industry to its knees. He urged his allies to do the same: “Anybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power … states should be ramping up right now.” As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. They have led an efficient and thorough campaign. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. Texas, for instance, passed the nation’s first law banning banks from the municipal bond business if they are found to be discriminating against the fossil fuel industry. Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch “unsubstantiated” attacks “against climate initiatives,” as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters. “At bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,” they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers’ Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas’ antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. Hild wanted more information — the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, “within weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,” big banks like Wells Fargo “start dropping like flies” from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, “We’re not recording this, right? … Please don’t quote me, because I’m telling the inside story on this.” He then described the leverage he had against Wall Street: potential enforcement actions that could end lucrative profit streams for the banks, and the possibility of long, painful lawsuits. “They’re all deathly afraid of being sued,” Webster said, explaining: “None of them want to be subject to depositions. None of them want to be subject to discovery.” Leo’s network has long been the top funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which works to elect GOP attorneys general.. Marble Freedom Trust is the primary vehicle through which Leo disburses the $1.6 billion bequeathed to him from billionaire industrialist Barre Seid for the purpose of waging the right-wing movement’s culture war. Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo’s dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives. According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo’s Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers’ Research. CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. A key cog in Leo’s network, the 85 Fund, was listed as the account holder. While the 85 Fund moved its corporate registration to Texas in 2023, the planning documents still listed its address in Washington, D.C., at the same building where Leo’s organizations have long operated. Consumers’ Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. Just six years after its founding, its workers split to form Consumers Union, which produces the well-regarded Consumer Reports magazine. Meanwhile, Consumers’ Research would denounce unions as communist and the group became a shill for the tobacco industry. The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo’s agenda. Since 2020, Consumers’ Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and “woke capitalism,” with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street. Some of the anti-ESG coalition’s biggest partners were in attendance at the Consumers’ Research summit, including representatives from ALEC, Heritage Action, and SFOF. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC’s largest known donor in 2023. The same year, Hild, Consumers’ Research’s director, said that Consumers’ Research was the largest donor to SFOF. For the past several years, as the Biden administration pursued greater action on climate change, Wall Street sought both to hedge its financial risks, and profit from new financial products touting ESG investing and diversity, equity, and inclusion — marketing them to the climate and socially conscious consumer. ESG assesses a company or investment decisions through a sustainability framework, in order to bolster long-term growth and reduce harm. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency. Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. Take for example, a chief target of the Leo coalition — BlackRock, the biggest pension fund manager in the world, with $12.5 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock has been at the forefront of ESG evangelism, while at the same time holding $400 billion in fossil fuel industry investments. Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. On a broader level, of course, allowing for maximum climate devastation will be both immensely costly for the citizens of Earth, as well as for business interests. At one point at the Consumers’ Research summit, Webster spoke about the push to have Republican-led states end any investments with BlackRock, arguing that currently, “red states are funding the war against us.” Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems’ finances. “The biggest problem we have right now is both of our retirement funds, and I’m sure, I’m glad I’m not being quoted here, but they do not have the courage to stand up to BlackRock,” he said. He argued that’s why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

Title: Woman (80) awarded €60,000 after social life impacted by trip on footpath

Time Published: 2025-07-15T16:08:13Z
Full Content:
An 80-year-old woman has been awarded just short of €60,000 damages by a judge who said her social life had been greatly impacted by injuries she suffered when she tripped and fell on a hazardous footpath. Judge Terence O’Sullivan said Anita Bryan, a keen golfer, of Somerton, Rochestown Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, had suffered bad injuries to her left wrist and right knee, causing her to abandon golf at her club, Woodenbridge in Arklow, Co Wicklow. “I haven’t played golf for five years because I am unable to walk for the four hours plus that it would take to complete a round,” Ms Bryan told the Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday. Barrister Damian Sheridan, who appeared with Murphy McElligott Solicitors for Ms Bryan, told the court she had tripped on the raised edge of a pavement slab outside Cavistons Food Emporium on the Glasthule Road, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on the day before Christmas Eve, 2019. Ms Bryan said she had been walking arm-in-arm with her husband when her shoe caught on the slab, catapulting her forward. She had fallen and broken her left wrist and suffered a displaced fracture of the right patella of her right knee. “The pain was dreadful and my wrist and leg were put in casts at the hospital. I was in a wheelchair for six weeks,” she told the judge. Ms Bryan said she had received eight cortisone injections and was awaiting more for her knee injury. “I cannot kneel properly any more and one of my favourite hobbies, apart from golf, was gardening,” she said. She sued Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Cavistons Food Emporium, which the local authority let out of the proceeding without blame. The judge told barrister Kevin Callan, counsel for Northstone Construction, Blackrock, Co Dublin, that his client was not liable for the incident. Forensic engineer Alan Conlan said he had examined the footpath shortly after the incident and found one of the slabs loose and rocking. The edge of the slab was raised above the level of other pavement slabs that had later been repaired. “The loose slab was a potential trip hazard,” he said. Awarding Ms Bryan €59,250, barely short of the €60,000 maximum jurisdiction of the court, against the local authority, Judge O’Sullivan said she had suffered bad injuries and had not overstated her claim in any way. “I feel that on the balance of probability that works to the footpath had to have been carried out by the local authority and nobody else,” the judge said. “Ms Bryan was a truthful witness and her life has been severely impacted by the accident. There is no question of contributory negligence.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum Shines Bright As Bank Of America Begins Digital Asset Tracking

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A new weekly “On Chain” report from Bank of America is shining a spotlight on Ethereum. According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress. Ethereum’s role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike. Based on reports, this week’s Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill. House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar’s global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows. BofA launches new weekly periodical ‘On Chain,’ designed to “drill into the various facets of the fast-evolving digital assets ecosystem.” First call: Bullish ETH pic.twitter.com/sERRZiTgMq — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 14, 2025 Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure. That nod isn’t just for the token itself. It’s a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum’s code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts. Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum. Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale. It isn’t all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum’s lead. Still, the network’s mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: WATCH LIVE: Trump plugs energy agenda at Pennsylvania innovation summit

Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Leave your feedback PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump touted tens of billions of dollars of recent energy and technology investments Tuesday in Pennsylvania while boasting of a “true golden age for America” in energy policy and artificial intelligence. Trump traveled to Pittsburgh at a summit helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick that included dozens of top executives from companies aiming to make the city and the state a hot spot for advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. McCormick announced more than $90 billion of investments in the state — spurring tens of thousands of jobs — although some of the projects had already been in progress ahead of the summit. Watch Trump’s remarks live in our video player above. “I think we have a true golden age for America. And we’ve been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University. “I’m honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I’m honored to be in Pittsburgh. And you’re going to see some real action here. So get ready.” Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. Both the president and senior administration officials on Tuesday framed the investments as part of a race against China for the most advanced deployment of artificial intelligence, with Trump saying, “We are way ahead of China, I have to say.” “China and other countries are racing to catch up to America on AI, and we’re not going to let them do it,” Trump said during the hourlong roundtable held in a university gymnasium, speaking often from prepared notes. Flanked by several of his Cabinet members, company executives and local political leaders, Trump added that the U.S. will be “fighting them in a very friendly fashion.” WATCH: Trump rolled back energy tax credits for homeowners and developers. Here’s what that means for you Before Trump spoke, his Cabinet members spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the AI race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an earlier panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand-new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects — such as a $15 billion project in central Pennsylvania — while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. READ MORE: Feeling the heat? Here are some ways to lower your electric bill Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant, and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in south-central Pennsylvania. Blackstone plans to spend $25 billion on data centers and building new natural gas-fired power plants in northeastern Pennsylvania, and the company will start construction by the end of 2028, said Jon Gray, its CEO. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. “What’s exciting about this event is it’s a great catalyst for investments and closing deals in the region,” said Jake Loosararian, the founder and CEO of Gecko Robotics. READ MORE: Senate blocks California’s rule banning new gas-powered car sales by 2035 Administration officials at the summit included White House crypto czar David Sacks, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Lutnick. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called AI Avenue that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. “What’s going on is a rewiring of the economy, of the world over the next 15 years and that takes trillions and trillions and tens of trillions of dollars, and it starts with power,” said Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, during a panel discussion. READ MORE: Nippon Steel finalizes $15 billion buyout of U.S. Steel after sealing national security agreement Pennsylvania has scored big investment wins in recent months, some driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Constellation Energy is reopening the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for Microsoft’s data centers.

Title: 5 stats that show where BlackRock is — and where the world's largest asset manager is going
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-earnings-call-key-stats-showing-trajectory-larry-fink-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-15T14:58:57Z
Full Content:
There are lots of big numbers that come up on BlackRock earnings calls. It's what happens when you're the largest asset manager in the world. The key thing for investors in the firm and competitors tracking the behemoth from afar is deciphering which of the gaudy current-day figures will keep growing and which of the optimistic projections will actually happen. BlackRock already manages $12.5 trillion in assets across institutions, insurers, pensions, and wealthy people, mostly in public markets. It's spent the last year and a half acquiring businesses that would help it move more of that money into lucrative private markets, where fees are higher and capital is stickier. At its investor day last month, the firm laid out its goal to hit $35 billion in annual revenue in 2030, an increase from $20 billion in 2024. Business Insider highlighted five stats from the firm's Tuesday call with analysts to demonstrate asset manager is currently and where it hopes to be in five years. The net inflows into BlackRock products in the first half. The influx of assets was led by a record six months from the firm's iShares ETF line, which brought in a net $192 billion of new money. BlackRock's existing business, particularly its low-fee index investing funds, is the biggest pile of money in the industry and is still growing consistently. Still, the first half of the year was not perfect, as some of the firm's actively traded products experienced a performance dip. The decline in performance fees collected by BlackRock in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Rocky equity and bond markets worldwide, caused primarily by the trade policies proposed by President Donald Trump, have been challenging for investors of all sizes to deal with. At BlackRock, the firm's profit margin dipped to 43.3% this quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's second quarter, and CFO Martin Small attributed 75% of that drop to the decline in performance fees. Active equity funds in particular have had a rough 12-month stretch, the firm's earnings supplement shows: Only 40% of assets are above the index or peer median. The firm also noted that private market funds brought in fewer performance fees than last year, but the firm's ambitions for that space remain as large as ever. The amount of revenue HPS Investment Partners is expected to add to BlackRock's coffers in the third quarter, according to Small. The deal for the $165 billion private credit shop closed at the start of July, and Small said the firm will issue the equivalent of up to 13.8 million shares of BlackRock common stock to retain the team at the firm. The retention of HPS's team will be critical for BlackRock, which wants to fundraise significantly for its private-credit and infrastructure offerings over the next five years. The fundraising goal for private market fundraising through 2030. Small said he expects it to ramp up in 2028 as HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners, the firm's other large private market investor acquisition, become more ingrained in the firm. CEO Larry Fink said that he was in Asia last week, where demand for infrastructure and other private-public partnerships is already "beyond our imagination." Those partnerships — the firm has pulled in Singapore's Temasek in its artificial intelligence infrastructure push — will be needed if the manager hopes to hit its revenue goals. The proportion of the firm's revenue that it wants to derive from its private markets funds and tech services platform, led by Aladdin, by 2030. The New York-based firm made nearly $10.7 billion in revenue in 2025's first half, driven by its equity ETFs, which hauled in $2.8 billion in revenue alone. Tech services, meanwhile, made roughly a third of that in the same time frame. BlackRock's Aladdin platform already serves more than 200 institutional clients, effectively making the firm an infrastructure provider to many of its clients and some of its competitors. But the firm's fundraising push for its private market offerings also includes the hope that individual retirement accounts in the US will soon be open to such options. Fink and Small both said that litigation reform is needed before that could happen, but are optimistic about what they've heard out of Washington on the subject. "We think we have all the building blocks here," Small said. Correction July 15, 2025: An earlier version of this story misstated BlackRock's revenue target for its private markets and technology businesses by 2030. The goal is for these segments to account for 30% of the firm's revenue, not 40%. Jump to
