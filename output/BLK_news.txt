Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner Influence Media Partners. Influence Media Partners, founded in 2019 by Lylette Pizarro, is revolutionizing music rights management by investing in and actively managing high-value music catalogs of diverse artists. The company differentiates itself through strategic partnerships, a focus on diversity, and active management of music properties to enhance value and promote artists' legacies. Pizarro's extensive experience and understanding of the evolving music rights landscape led to the company's formation. Influence Media Partners has secured $750 million in funding from prominent entities like BlackRock and Warner Music Group, enabling its expansion. Since its inception, the company has grown substantially, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label focused on nurturing emerging talent . NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - SEPTEMBER 18: Stevie Frasure, Lylette Pizarro, Ben Vaughn, Jesse Frasure, ... [+] Spencer Nohe, Lynn Hazan and Phil May attend the Jesse Frasure Return to Calm Springs Listening Experience in Partnership with Rhythm House, Influence Media Partners and Warner Chappell at Soho House Nashville on September 18, 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee. Influence Media Partners is disrupting the music industry by not just investing in but actively managing high-value music catalogs and has raised $750 million for two funds and is currently raising for its third fund. Founder Pizarro is a seasoned music and entertainment strategist who gained extensive experience working with Fortune 50 companies. In her role at RPM, she negotiated transformative music partnerships with artists, record labels, and songwriters. Influence Media focuses on diverse artists with the potential to create enduring cultural impact. The firm targets active artists and songwriters with a history of engaging their fans and creating music across various genres who want to continue building their legacy and intellectual property. ““Lylette is a force that brings a sense of power and prestige to a songwriter in my shoes,” describes Nicolle Galyon, Grammy Nominated singer, songwriter and producer. “Having her invested in my copyrights and my creativity gives me a posture that I didn’t previously have.” For many folks investing in music, “it is just a buy and sell strategy," Pizarro explained. "The way Influence has thought about it is invest and build—invest, partner, and build. We're in constant dialog with the managers and artists directly, and thinking about new ways to unlock value, which is truly different to the marketplace." This commitment to partnership and building value sets Influence Media apart. Rather than simply acquiring catalogs and waiting for returns, the company leverages its team's expertise to actively enhance the value of its music properties through strategic marketing and brand building. This approach, combined with a strong emphasis on diversity and strategic alliances, has enabled the company to identify a unique position in the industry. Pizarro's deep understanding of the evolving music rights landscape honed over 20 years in the business, has been key to the company's success. She recognized a shift in the market and saw an opportunity to build a new platform that champions the artists and holds their catalogs. Influence Media’s unique approach has attracted significant investment from industry heavyweights like Warner Music Group. "Lylette has a fresh and thoughtful approach to acquiring and working culturally and commercially impactful catalogs which is delivering real results,” said Temi Adeniji, Managing Director of Warner Music Africa and SVP of Sub-Saharan Africa at Warner. “We're collaborating on exciting projects with artists as varied as Enrique Iglesias, Future, and Tainy, who have all placed their trust in Lylette and her team to help build their musical legacies." The firm also attracted investment from BlackRock. “Lylette's vision for the industry, ability to create meaningful and long-lasting relationships, and unyielding work ethic underpin her success,” explained Paul Braude, chief investment officer and head, direct private opportunities at BlackRock. These partnerships provide crucial financial backing and strategic support, enabling the company to expand its portfolio and reach. Warner Music Group, in particular, was instrumental in establishing early credibility and trust for the first-time fund. Since its launch, Influence Media has achieved remarkable growth. The company has secured $750 million in funding, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres with catalogs from artists like Enrique Iglesias and Blake Shelton, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label and publisher focused on artist development. Slang has signed Will Smith, Future, Truththebull and RaiNao along with Grammy-winning producers such as 30 Roc and Camper who have worked with the likes of Big Sean, Mary J. Blige, Cardi B, and Roddy Ricch. Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner at Influence Media Partners, Lex Borrero, a ... [+] prominent music executive, producer, and co-founder of NEON16, and Melissa Vargas, Brand Manager at Parkwood Entertainment attend Influence Media toasts René McLean at GRAMMY Week at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on February 02, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. Fundraising for a new venture is always challenging, and Influence Media was no exception. The team pitched their vision to 200 investors, a testament to their dedication and perseverance. As a first-time fund manager, Pizarro lacked the established track record that institutional investors typically seek, making the process even more difficult. To overcome this, she strategically assembled a team with a unique blend of expertise in both music finance and traditional investment. This ensured that her strategy was clearly articulated and her execution plan was solid, increasing the confidence of potential investors. The Influence Media management team boasts a wealth of experience besides Pizarro’s. Co-managing partner Lynn Hazan brings 25 years of experience as CFO at Sony Music Group, while partner Rene McLean has a strong background and creative experience in music and entertainment strategy and licensing. Founding advisor and investor Jon Jashni offers expertise in media investment and content production while Danny Klotz, head of underwriting, possesses deep experience in finance and analytics. “Making sure that the investment team was both a mix of music FP&A [financial planning and analysis] and classic investor DNA was critical,” Pizarro explained. This diverse team was laser-focused on strategically investing in music rights, differentiating themselves in a crowded marketplace filled with institutional capital. Their strong point of view on recorded music and songwriter rights, combined with a clear articulation of their strategy, helped them stand out. Pizarro also had to overcome the hurdle of being a woman and a minority—Latina—in a predominantly male industry. “Her [Lylette] drive is matched only by her passion for music and by the care she has for those around her, whether it be the team she has built at Influence, the partners for whom she delivers or the artists with whom she partners, said Pam Chan, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Mosaic at Lingotto.” Influence Media is a diverse company, with women and minorities comprising a significant portion of its leadership. “We were 66% female leadership and 66% diverse,” Pizarro shared. Perhaps because of this, Pizarro and her team faced skepticism and questions about their ability to succeed. However, they persevered and ultimately secured major investments. “Ultimately, we found the right partners, and they have been fantastic partners to us,” Pizarro affirmed. These strategic partnerships not only provided financial backing but also enhanced the firm's credibility, demonstrating to other investors that Influence Media could achieve its ambitious goals. Warner Music Group's involvement, in particular, signaled trust and credibility, while BlackRock's investment brought significant financial weight and further solidified the company's industry standing.

Title: Could Political Betting Swing The US Election?

Time Published: 2024-10-30T05:42:45Z

As the 1549 papal conclave dragged on into a second and third month, Venice's ambassador to the Vatican, Matteo Dandolo, was outraged by insider trading. “It is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll,” he said, “and that the cardinals' attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands.” Although the conclave was supposedly secret, Roman traders ran a thriving market in the streets around the Vatican trying to predict the winner. Odds shifted rapidly, and bettors appeared suspiciously well informed and perceptive. Everyone knew the race was wide open, and the original favorite in the crowded field, at 5-to-1 against (or 17% odds), was Cardinal Giovanni Maria del Monte. Ten weeks later, he was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate, but only after opposing cardinals had brought forward a parade of options. Bettors on the streets helped the population understand who was leading, and by spotting early on that Julius might be the inoffensive candidate who would provoke the least opposition, they even guided the cardinals as they tried to break the deadlock. Prediction markets grew so widespread and so disliked that by the end of the 16th century, Pope Gregory XIV had outlawed them. The penalty for betting on the identity of the next pope was excommunication. Five centuries later, the urge to bet on elections has not abated. Neither has the whiff of corruption surrounding them, nor the sense that bettors' money can move not just markets but election results themselves. For centuries there have been cycles of political betting — in 19th century Pall Mall clubs, and in the early 20th century on the floors of the New York and London stock exchanges — punctuated by moves to ban them. As the 2024 presidential campaign drives towards a bitter conclusion, the cycle is repeating. This time the ultimate authority is not the pope but the US Supreme Court. At present, the US's biggest political betting markets are offshore. The only legal, regulated entities are nonprofits run as academic experiments with tight limits on how much can be wagered — the best known are the Iowa Electronic Markets and PredictIt.com, which operates in the US under the auspices of Victoria University in New Zealand. Now, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is fighting an attempt to set up a legal onshore political futures market, which would allow Americans to take part without limits on how much they can trade. In the latest round, the for-profit Kalshi futures market won a stay against the CFTC's ban that cleared the way for a huge experiment. The litigation could go on for years, but Kalshi can run a market on this year's election, and its odds now appear in huge neon lights above Times Square. This has prompted established brokers to get in on the act; Interactive Brokers also launched political futures trading for the election. The world's richest man is paying attention. Earlier this month, Elon Musk urged his followers on the online platform X, which he owns, to follow the offshore venue Polymarket (launched by his former colleague Peter Thiel). “More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line,” he wrote. At the time, Polymarket showed Donald Trump's chances at 50.1%. Hours later, and with no relevant news, a still-anonymous French investor made the first of a series of giant trades now totaling some $45 million on a Trump win, pushing his odds way up. Ten days later, with Kamala Harris still ahead in polls of polls, Trump's chances had surged to 62.2%. PredictIt, populated mostly by academics limited to stakes of $850, also raised Trump's chances, but at a much slower pace. The press was more interested in Polymarket. Since Musk's tweet it has featured in 10 times more news stories than PredictIt. Polymarket's odds helped change the narrative in markets where far more money is at stake. Treasury yields and share prices both rose, as traders started pricing in a Trump win and the corporate tax cuts that would come with it. The Problem of Reflexivity Like all markets, popular prediction markets are prone to what the hedge fund manager George Soros calls “reflexivity.” Rather than just reflecting or reacting to facts on the ground, moves in bonds, stocks or oil markets can actually change that reality. It is this fear that animates opposition to Kalshi. The pressure group Better Markets, an amicus in the CFTC's suit, asserts that manipulating these markets could shift the facts. Cantrell Dumas, its director of derivatives policy, says that if the markets are taken seriously and show that one candidate is likely to win “people could stay home and not vote for their preferred candidate.” On the other side, Kalshi's supporters argue that manipulation is a problem for all markets, and the key is regulation. David Mason, general counsel of PredictIt and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission argues, “these manipulation problems are dealt with in regulated markets every day. There are trading exclusions; if they have material non-public information then they are prohibited from trading. Kalshi has a long list of people who aren't allowed to trade.” But Dumas rejects the comparison. “In a traditional market, if a regulator sees manipulation and takes action, it has remedies. With election manipulation that changes the result, that's irreparable harm. It's a fundamental distinction,” he told me. The excitement since Musk's tweet looks very much like reflexivity in action. And social change has amplified the potential reflexive power of markets. We are now far more inclined to trust in the “wisdom of crowds.” Most importantly, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, developed in the 1950s and the basis for much modern finance, holds that markets continuously incorporate all information, and so they can't be consistently beaten, except by insiders who know something others don't. Central to the argument for investing passively in indexes and exchange-traded funds, this idea can transmogrify into a belief that markets can't be wrong. Historically, political betting is impressively accurate. The academics Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz demonstrated 20 years ago that over history, markets had come closer to getting presidential elections right (with an average error of 1.5%) than the Gallup poll, which was on average off by 2.1%. Market discipline should help experts thrash out a better consensus estimate, and many companies now run internal prediction markets to improve forecasting. Wikipedia and Google have convinced us that crowd-sourcing information can work, and popular culture is saturated with tales of brilliant statisticians, like Michael Lewis' 2003 book Moneyball on how the Oakland A's used statistics to spot good players others had missed. Nate Silver, an adviser to Polymarket, made his name as a baseball statistician. Then there's what Wall Streeters call the Elaine Garzarelli Effect: We tend to place excessive trust in whichever guru made a good call last time. As a Lehman Brothers investment strategist, Garzarelli brilliantly urged clients to get out of the stock market the week before the Black Monday crash in 1987. That made her one of the most widely quoted strategists on the Street; her words would move markets, and she compiled a good track record. But she was fallible — in December 2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis, she proclaimed that stocks were undervalued by 25% — and people lost interest. In politics, the offshore Intrade prediction market developed a Garzarelli effect after calling 49 states correctly in 2008, and then all 50 — amid much attention — in 2012. Then regulators shut it down, but other venues rose to replace it. The market odds on a Donald Trump victory were about 35% on election night in 2016. Betting markets may also have grown more reflexive because the legalization of sports betting has made gambling socially acceptable, while investing looks ever more like gambling. Baseball banned Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose for life over wagering on the sport. Now, Major League Baseball has its own formal spread-betting partner. Investment apps now resemble video games: Robinhood.com drove the meme stock craze of 2021 as people poured stimulus checks, and a lot of political anger, into bets on companies like GameStop Corp. While papal envoys disdained people betting in the street, our current society has little problem with people trading elections on their phones. Reflexivity is amplified by a constant of human nature; our psychological need for an anchor. We want a number, and once we have one we cling to it, because it gives us an illusion of control. The idea of anchoring has been a staple of behavioral finance since it was first applied to economics by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky 50 years ago. Their experiments showed that people's answers to numeric questions can be skewed just by showing them a number at random before they answer. In the unmoored climate of a polarized election that appears to be in a dead heat, our desire for an anchor will naturally grow. In the UK's Brexit referendum, betting markets put the chances that Britons would vote to leave the EU at one in five. Statisticians David Rothschild and Andrew Gelman argued afterwards that there was “a feedback mechanism whereby the betting-market odds reify themselves.” People distrusted polls, they said, but “we do watch the prediction markets, which all sorts of experts have assured us capture the wisdom of crowds.” Pollsters and pundits — and even the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage — were “to some extent anchoring themselves off the prediction odds,” and dismissed polls that showed Brexit in the lead. The clue, Rothschild and Gelman argued, was that a “mature prediction market should show measured, but real, swings in prices in response to news,” but the Brexit odds stayed weirdly stable. Polls closed with the market odds of Brexit at 31%. When they were proved wrong, the pound dropped by more than 10% in a matter of minutes — more than treble its previous worst fall. Brexit looks very much like a classic example of Soros' reflexivity at work — and on the face of it, suggests that the CFTC is amply justified in trying to keep political betting out of mainstream investment. Self-Fulfilling Prophecies The CFTC's problem is that the other markets it regulates exist to help manage risks, from fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates to the possibility of a catastrophic hurricane. Investors wish to insure against political surprises — with the fallout from the Brexit vote showing why they might be sensible. So how to allow that, while limiting the chance of either deliberate manipulation or innocent irrational exuberance which, with reflexivity, could turn markets into a tool for changing election results? There are two plausible solutions. The first, advocated by Kalshi and Polymarket, is to make markets liquid by attracting more money. With billions at stake, no individual can move the market. But for now, while they remain on a smaller scale, whales can make a big splash. The alternative is to limit liquidity. PredictIt's $850 limit on stakes thwarts whales. A rich person's views don't count for more just because they're rich. But it's harder to move the price when genuine news happens, and it reduces the market's usefulness as a place to manage risk. Limited markets might produce the public good of more robust predictions, but a multi-trillion dollar manager like BlackRock cannot hedge a given election result on PredictIt. Recent experiences with opening new markets have shown how difficult this can be. In the decade before the global financial crisis, quants spotted that emerging markets and commodity futures tended to gain over time, with a low correlation to stocks and bonds. That sounded like the holy grail for asset allocators, and big institutions piled in. Once they did so, however, they changed the way these markets behaved and interacted. If money moved into copper as a result of a deliberate decision to move out of bonds, for example, it was inevitable that bonds and copper would grow more correlated, which they did. In 2008, stocks, commodities and emerging markets all crashed together. Similarly, once big financial hedgers and/or wealthy individuals arrive in betting markets, there's no reason to assume those markets will keep behaving the same way. Treasury bonds, oil or tech stocks are deep markets combining people with many different motivations, and the messages they send should be taken very seriously; Kalshi, Polymarket and others are far from that scale. There's also the eternal issue of Garbage In, Garbage Out. Markets synthesize information and give participants an incentive to sniff out fake news. But they aren't a protection against bad information — if the polls are wrong, markets will be wrong. If well regulated, political prediction markets might yet provide probabilities that help guide us in times of uncertainty. But like all markets they will be prone to get things wrong, and while they remain largely unregulated, it behooves us to be careful. The threat of excommunication doesn't deter miscreants the way it once did. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. The crypto market has reflected a bullish trend, with significant price growth over the past week. Moreover, digital assets inflows hit $901 million for the week ending October 25. The recent boom pushed the inflow volume to $27 billion year-to-date (YTD), almost tripling the 2021 record. Meanwhile, the US leads with $906 million in asset inflows for the week. The US political election is driving bullish market sentiment, with Bitcoin posting inflows of over $920 million. The digital assets market recorded a boom for the week ending October 25, with net asset inflows reaching $901 million, according to CoinShares weekly report. Moreover, the growth has pushed crypto assets’ year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $27 billion, almost three times the value recorded throughout 2021. Further, the report revealed that Bitcoin amassed about $920 million in weekly inflows, with the upcoming US political elections driving the market boom. CoinShares reported: “We believe that current Bitcoin prices and flows are heavily influenced by US politics, with the recent surge in inflows likely linked to the Republicans’ poll gains.” Meanwhile, the US witnessed the biggest weekly inflows of about $906 million, a sharp contrast to other regions. Germany and Switzerland followed in the second and third positions with net inflows of $14.5 million and $9.2 million. Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong posted net outflows of $10.1 million, $3.6 million, and $2.7 million. On a month-to-date (MTD) basis, digital assets have posted $3.32 billion in inflows this month. This marks October as the fourth-largest month in 2024 in terms of inflows. Bitcoin’s YTD and MTD inflows now stand at $25.46 billion and $3.27 billion as of the week ending October 25. Also, BTC-related investment products boast a whopping $78.99 billion in assets under management (AUM). Solana-based investment products followed Bitcoin with the second-largest inflows of $10.8 million last week. Their MTD and YTD flows amounted to $17.9 million and $69.2 million. Blockchain equities also followed the week’s trend of positive flows, posting $12.2 million in net inflows. On the other hand, Ethereum saw net outflows of $34.7 million for the week. However, its YTD record highlights net inflows of $748 million. For ETFs, BlackRock iShares’ IBIT maintained its lead with weekly inflows of $1.16 billion. The product boasts over $28 billion in assets under management (AUM). In contrast, Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB posted the largest outflows of 206 million for the week. Cumulatively, the 12 US-based ETFs have about $78.9 billion in AUM. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price surged to over $70,000 on October 28. Your email address will not be published.

Rising cloud revenue for AlphabetGoogle-parent Alphabet's third-quarter earnings beat expectations. The company's quarterly revenue was $88.27 billion, up 15% year on year, boosted by its cloud division's 35% jump in revenue from a year ago. Google's search and advertising revenue also grew. Net income was $26.3 billion, 33.5% higher than the year-ago quarter. Reddit swings to profitReddit shares surged almost 25% in extended trading Tuesday, breaking the $100 barrier for the first time, on the company's better-than-expected third-quarter results. Notably, Reddit turned profitable in the third quarter with net income of $29.9 million, compared with a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago. Mixed marketsOn Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.78% to close at a new high and the S&P 500 added 0.16%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.36%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.57%. Earnings results from European companies were mixed, causing trading in the region to be choppy. End of zero interest rates eraLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower rates only once, by 25 basis points, for the rest of this year because of high "embedded inflation," Fink said at a panel Tuesday. At the same event, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said the era of zero interest rates and zero inflation is over. [PRO] Citi likes these small-cap stocksThe Russell 2000 has gained around 10.4% so far this year. While that trails the S&P 500's 22% increase in the same period, both analysts and investors are paying more attention to small-cap stocks. As the Fed cuts interest rates, small-cap stocks tend to benefit more — and these are the small-cap stocks Citi thinks are good buys. A day in the life of an average office worker: Those behaviors are so ingrained in most of us that they're almost automatic and essential. It's not too surprising, then, that the companies behind those services – Snap, Reddit and Alphabet – reported third-quarter results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Their revenues, in particular, are bright spots. For its third quarter, Alphabet's advertising revenue increased 10.4% year on year. While Snap and Reddit didn't report their advertising top line specifically, there were indications both companies are also doing well in that area. Snap's total active advertisers have more than doubled from the year-ago quarter, according to CEO Evan Spiegel. That's coupled with two million more global daily active users than expected. More advertisers and more eyeballs mean more revenue per ad. Meanwhile, Reddit swung from a loss a year ago to earning a profit. That remarkable transformation was in part helped by a 47% year-over-year jump in daily active users and better-than-expected average revenue per user. All companies reported earnings after the bell. In extended trading, shares of Reddit rocketed almost 25%, Snap surged around 10.6% and Alphabet added 5.8%. It's Meta's and Microsoft's turn to report earnings later today. Microsoft isn't really involved in the ad market because it's more focused on enterprise products. But investors will be watching to see if Meta keeps up with the positive trend so far. Judging by how much time I spend on Meta-owned Instagram and see ads that seem to know exactly what I want, the company's ad revenue is likely to see healthy growth as well. — CNBC's Julia Boorstin, Jonathan Vanian and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

Title: BlackRock in talks to buy private credit firm HPS, Bloomberg News reports

(Reuters) -Asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has emerged as the sole bidder in talks to acquire private credit firm HPS Investment Partners, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. The parties are seeking to reach an agreement by the end of this year, the report said, adding that HPS may pursue an initial public offering or a minority stake sale if the parties cannot reach an agreement on valuation. HPS would target a post-IPO valuation of $11 billion, with plans to seek a premium above that figure in a sale, the report said. BlackRock and HPS Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. BlackRock, which manages more than $10 trillion, is seeking to capitalize on a boom in investor demand for alternative assets, which includes anything from private equity to infrastructure. HPS Investment Partners is a global investment firm managing assets across debt, liquid credit including syndicated leveraged loans, asset-based finance and real estate, according to its website. It had about $117 billion of assets under management as of June 2024. Earlier in July, BlackRock agreed to buy UK data firm Preqin for 2.55 billion pounds ($3.32 billion) in cash. Later in September, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved BlackRock's $12.5 billion deal for Global Infrastructure Partners. ($1 = 0.7686 pounds)

Title: Microsoft's $30 Billion Infrastructure Fund Is Driving Vertical Integration Of AI

Microsoft, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX have announced the formation of the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at raising $30 billion in equity capital for AI infrastructure investments. This fund has the potential to mobilize up to $100 billion when including debt financing, making it one of the largest alternative investment funds ever raised. The scale of this investment underscores the magnitude of the opportunity Microsoft sees in AI infrastructure. It also highlights the company's commitment to maintaining its position as a leader in the AI race, not just through software innovation but through control of the underlying infrastructure that powers AI. The GAIIP will focus on investing in new and expanded data centers, as well as energy infrastructure to power these facilities, primarily in the United States. This strategic move by Microsoft expands the boundaries of AI competition beyond software and services into the crucial realm of infrastructure. By investing in the foundational elements of AI, Microsoft aims to enhance its cloud services, support its own AI development, and create a competitive advantage in the AI ecosystem. This infrastructure-based approach has proven successful for Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has leveraged its data center infrastructure to not only provide cloud hardware services but also to offer a wide range of software applications to customers. By controlling the entire stack - from the physical infrastructure to the software running on it - Microsoft can optimize its AI offerings for performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability. This vertical integration allows tighter control over the entire AI value chain, potentially leading to more innovative and competitive AI products and services. The profitability potential of this strategy is significant when blending data center infrastructure margins with software margins. While data centers require substantial upfront investment, the ability to layer high-margin software and services on top allows cloud providers to achieve considerable profitability. This initiative is expected to have far-reaching implications for the AI industry. It could intensify competition, potentially leading to industry consolidation as smaller AI companies may struggle to compete with the scale of infrastructure that Microsoft and its partners can provide. This move could create a significant distinction between companies like Microsoft, which are investing heavily in both infrastructure and software, and those focusing solely on software development in the AI space. Companies without access to such extensive infrastructure may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, potentially leading to a reshaping of the AI industry landscape. The GAIIP's focus on both data centers and energy infrastructure is particularly significant. Energy has emerged as the next critical frontier in the AI revolution, and the GAIIP recognizes this by including energy infrastructure in its investment strategy. As AI workloads become increasingly demanding, the need for powerful, energy-efficient data centers grows. By investing in energy infrastructure alongside data centers, Microsoft is addressing one of the key challenges in AI development: the massive energy requirements of AI computations. Data centers, the backbone of AI operations, are projected to consume an increasingly higher percentage of total U.S. electricity in the next decade. This surge in power consumption presents both a challenge and an opportunity. GAIIP’s approach not only ensures the scalability of AI technologies but also opens up opportunities for innovations in energy production, distribution, and management. Moreover, this investment strategy aligns with the growing trend of sustainability in technology. By focusing on energy infrastructure alongside data centers, Microsoft can potentially develop more environmentally friendly AI solutions, addressing concerns about the carbon footprint of AI technologies. By investing in new sources of power for these facilities, the partnership aims to create a more resilient and efficient energy ecosystem that can support the exponential growth of AI. The GAIIP aims to set a new standard for AI investments, positioning the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. As global demand for AI capabilities continues to surge, these investments will likely drive economic growth, create jobs, and foster innovation in the AI sector. It is important to emphasize that the capital required for AI infrastructure and energy needs surpasses what any single company or government can finance. This partnership is expected to advance technology while enhancing national competitiveness, security, and economic prosperity. In conclusion, Microsoft and BlackRock's partnership to create this $30 billion AI infrastructure fund represents a strategic expansion of the AI competitive landscape. By investing in the foundational infrastructure of AI, Microsoft is positioning itself to dominate not just in software and services but in the entire AI vertical stack. This move could reshape the AI industry, accelerate innovation, and solidify Microsoft's position as a leader in the AI-driven future of technology. The fund's commitment to energy infrastructure underscores the understanding that the future of AI is inextricably linked to advancements in energy technology, making it a crucial area for investment and development in the AI-driven economy.

Title: The Fed is likely to disappoint markets with just one more rate cut this year amid global inflation, BlackRock CEO says

The Federal Reserve will disappoint markets by cutting interest rates just one more time in 2024, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. Fink said the Fed will likely cut interest rates by 25 basis points before the end of the year amid a rise in global inflation. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25, but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said during a Tuesday panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The market sees two more cuts this year, pricing in a 25 basis point cut at the November and December meetings, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Investors see slimmer odds of about 30% that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in December. Fink pointed to inflationary policies in the US, which he said are changing the economy's consumer-driven nature. "We have a government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost,'" he said. "Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking." His comments point to the policies aimed at bringing supply chains closer to the US and "re-shoring" domestic manufacturing jobs via spending bills like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Those measures will likely mean inflation sticks around and prompts the Fed to pause its easing cycle, Fink suggested. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting." The latest inflation reading for September showed the consumer price index grew 2.4% year over year, down slightly from 2.5% in August, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After Fink's comments, another panel at the conference reaffirmed his forecast. When asked to raise their hand if they expected the Fed to cut interest rates twice more before the end of the year, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and other Wall Street giants kept their hands down, according to CNBC. The central bank kicked off its easing cycle with a jumbo 50 basis point cut last month. This week will be important for the Fed's decision-making process, with a slew of data releases scheduled, including personal consumption expenditures, third-quarter GDP, and the October jobs report.

Title: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-skyrockets-above-71000-key-reasons/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T16:30:50Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin price has surged past the $71,000 mark today. Over the past five days, Bitcoin’s price has rallied by more than 8.5%, climbing from $65,600 to as high as $71,118 on October 29. In the last 24 hours alone, the BTC price has increased by 3.8%. This upward momentum can be attributed to four key factors: The surge in Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to substantial inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday witnessed massive ETF flows totaling $479.4 million. BlackRock led the inflows with $315.2 million, followed by Fidelity at $44.1 million, Ark with $59.8 million, and Bitwise at $38.7 million. These significant investments coincided with Bitcoin’s price movement from $68,000 to over $71,000. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin ETF inflows and CME Open Interest. He noted “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher, CME Open Interest is up, but not as much GBTC outflows are also minimal. We’re seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades.” The divergence suggests that investors are favoring direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs rather than engaging in cash and carry trades involving futures contracts. The carry trade strategy in the context of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures involves buying the ETF (tracking the spot price of Bitcoin) and simultaneously shorting Bitcoin futures on the CME. This approach aims to capitalize on price differences when futures trade at a premium to the spot price (contango). The notable shift toward ETFs indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, anticipating further price appreciation. Political developments are also influencing Bitcoin’s recent rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the impact of former President Donald Trump’s interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has gained over 32 million views and driven his Polymarket odds above 66%. Despite “crypto” being touted as the “Trump Trade,” Bitcoin’s correlation with Trump’s potential election victory seems to fuel the Bitcoin price rally. QCP Capital also noted that Bitcoin is up only 8% this “Uptober,” compared to an average of 21% in previous Octobers. They stated, “If spot holds at these levels, this October would mark Bitcoin’s fourth-worst performance in the past decade.” With total BTC perpetual futures open interest across exchanges standing at $27 billion—approaching this year’s peak—a breakout above $70,000 could trigger new all-time highs, especially with more leveraged longs joining in. Market data indicates a significant shorts squeeze contributing to Bitcoin’s price spike. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 65,622 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations across the entire crypto market amounting to $228.51 million. Of this, $169.47 million were short liquidations. Specifically for Bitcoin, $83.61 million in shorts were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $18 million. The substantial liquidation of short positions suggests that many traders were betting on a price decline and were forced to close their positions as the market moved against them. This mass unwinding of shorts can accelerate upward price movements as traders buy back into the market to cover their positions. Large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” are playing a pivotal role in the current rally. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet observed that Bitcoin’s rally continues, led by activity on the Binance exchange. He pointed out that Binance whales began significant involvement in the market two weeks ago during Asian trading hours, and recent declines in the Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) alongside price increases are “a clear sign of Binance whales’ intervention. Mignolet emphasized that this should not be interpreted as a decline in US demand, but an even stronger buying pressure from Binance. Over the past two weeks, demand for US Bitcoin spot ETFs has surged, with a net inflow of approximately 47,000 Bitcoin. Since most ETF products use Coinbase, movements in CPG data are closely tied to ETF demand. He concluded, “The current Bitcoin price is being driven by Binance whales, with sustained inflows of US capital.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,340.

Title: ‘Economic steel’: New Zealand’s Bitcoin opportunity, according to Michael Saylor

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor says the crypto currency presents an opportunity for New Zealand investors, and suggests domestic businesses should acquire it to boost their balance sheets. “It represents an extraordinary financial opportunity for people in New Zealand, and that’s kind of why I’m pleasantly surprised that you’re here,” MicroStrategy executive chairman Saylor told Markets with Madison in Washington DC. “The people that really need it [Bitcoin] are the global investors that are not in the major cities. “Because you can buy into the most scarce, desirable, global, digital property, and you’re getting the same investment proposition as a New York billionaire. “[New Zealanders] need it more. Trust fund babies in Manhattan don’t need it, they’ve got a lot of other [investment] options.” Saylor said investors like himself – who personally owned at least US$1.1 billion ($1.8b) worth of the crypto currency – were actively attempting to drive its price higher, meaning buyers of Bitcoin would stand to benefit. His Nasdaq-listed technology company was the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with more than 225,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet worth more than US$16b. Saylor suggested New Zealand businesses could follow his adoption playbook and acquire Bitcoin as a Treasury asset. “If you’ve got a company that’s a low-growth company, geared to the New Zealand economy, if you start to invest your balance sheet into Bitcoin, you are now with a 1% grower in New Zealand bolted on to a 50% high-growth, Big Tech, digital monetary network. “How many companies in New Zealand grow 20% a year for 10 years in a row? The odds are just about next to none. “But what are the odds of Bitcoin going up 20% a year? That’s actually my bear case.” Saylor expected Bitcoin to reach a price of US$13 million – it was currently about US$68,000. This year, financial institutions including BlackRock launched exchange-traded funds, offering investors exposure to the crypto currency through the stock market for a low fee. He believed Bitcoin’s next big moment – more listed companies or governments adopting Bitcoin – would be driven by banks accepting it as money in accounts or as collateral for loans. “Banking is just the next logical step,” Saylor suggested. “If you want to see all the people with the money and the power in the world embrace the asset, they will do it when their vendors support the asset. That’s a rippling thing.” Some Bitcoin investors were against Saylor’s suggestion banks should become more significant custodians of the asset because it would centralise a currency popular for its decentralised nature. In the interview he defended his position, arguing it increased the safety of the asset. “I think when the Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes, or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure. “When you have regulated, public entities like BlackRock and Fidelity and JP Morgan and State Street bank holding the asset, well, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms, they’re invested in those entities. “So, there’s no way all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets ... because that’s where all their retirement money is.” Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network had no central power controlling it and no central point of technological failure. Speaking to the characteristics of the Bitcoin network and its invention by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Saylor said it achieved scarcity and had an “immaculate conception”. “Satoshi launches it, walks away forever, disclaims beneficial ownership – it’s an immaculate conception.” The initial Bitcoin mined by Nakamoto to secure the network had not been sold, Saylor said. Bitcoin’s supply was capped at 21 million tokens, meaning it had an expected deflation rate, unlike fiat currencies issued by central banks that targeted an annual rate of inflation. While many other crypto currencies had been launched, Saylor said Bitcoin was clearly the winner. “It’s because all the smart money in the world decided that’s the winner. Did it have to be? Well, no. “It’s like, why do we speak English? Because all the rich, powerful people decided on English. Could it have been a different language? It could have been French.” Explaining why he believed Bitcoin was a superior asset, Saylor said it was “clean money”, akin to “economic steel”, compared with dirty money such as sovereign debt, which had a negative real yield after tax. “It’s like forcible chemotherapy for your healthy 14-year-old teenager,” he said of sovereign debt. “That’s the scourge, the burden of humanity that they’ve been hauling for thousands of years. “When you ask, ‘What is human progress, what elevated the civilisation?’, it’s technology.” Saylor himself was once against Bitcoin, comparing it to online gambling in a 2013 post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Acknowledging it, Saylor said: “Everyone’s against Bitcoin before they’re for it.” “I’m sure the first guy with fire scared a bunch of other tribesmen. No one wants to get burned. Yet without fire, we’re not better than the apes.” When asked why he bothered being so publicly bullish on Bitcoin, Saylor said he wanted to “fix the money”. “If the money is broken, all eight billion people have toxic capital. All 300 million companies have toxic capital.” Watch part one and two of Michael Saylor discussing Bitcoin and his company MicroStrategy on Markets with Madison in the videos above.

In a highly controversial statement, Elon Musk estimated that artificial intelligence (AI) has a 10-20% chance of developing in an extremely negative direction (for the planet). The owner of X, the automaker Tesla, and the space company SpaceX is participating as a speaker at the 8th FII conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This statement carries additional weight coming from Musk, who is known for his investments in AI development and, until now, has defended its safety despite concerns about its future evolution. However, this is not the first time the billionaire entrepreneur has commented on the dangers of AI. According to Bloomberg, the conference includes executives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Citadel, with Musk invited via live streaming to discuss AI. “I believe that artificial intelligence poses a significant existential threat and something we need to be very cautious about,” Musk stressed. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Musk reaffirmed predictions he made months ago, warning that AI carries the risk of “wiping out” humanity. Nonetheless, he added a more optimistic note, suggesting there is now an 80-90% chance that AI’s development could yield positive outcomes. “I think it will be capable of doing anything a human can do, possibly within the next one to two years,” Musk told the conference. He also predicted that by 2040, around 10,000 humanoid robots might be in operation.

Title: Saudi wealth fund to cut overseas investments
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/saudi-wealth-fund-to-cut-overseas-investments-3688693
Time Published: 2024-10-29T15:11:58Z

By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Iain Withers and Anousha Sakoui RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund plans to cut its overseas investments by about a third, its governor told a conference in Riyadh on Tuesday, as the Kingdom taps into its resources to fund plans to wean the economy off oil. Speaking on a panel of business, technology and finance leaders, Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said the sovereign wealth fund was more focused on the domestic economy and aiming to bring the fund's international investments down to between 18% and 20% of the total from 30%. Global business, technology and financial leaders have converged on the Saudi capital for the annual Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit, an opportunity for attendees to forge relations with some of Saudi Arabia's biggest companies and its $925 billion sovereign wealth fund. This year, the event may also test investor appetite in Saudi Arabia's economic transformation at a time when there are fears of widening conflict in the Middle East. The sovereign wealth fund is the main vehicle for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to steer the Saudi economy away from oil, with investments of hundreds of billions of dollars to develop new sectors and create more sustainable revenue streams. However, the fund has been scaling back some of its flagship "giga-projects" due to rising costs. Al-Rumayyan said there had been a shift in the way the fund deploys its investments towards establishing joint ventures with both international and local companies. "Now we see a shift from people who want us to invest or take our money to invest from there to co-investments," he told the conference. The country's investment minister, Khalid-al-Falih, said on Tuesday that the number of foreign companies with regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia had reached 540, ahead of a 2030 target of 500. An example of one will be Mizuho Bank, whose CEO Masahiko Kato said: "we will establish a regional headquarter in KAFD, in Riyadh." Oil remains the mainstay of the Saudi economy and Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the same event that the country was committed to maintaining crude capacity at 12.3 million barrels per day. Other high-profile speakers on Tuesday included Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) President and CIO Ruth Porat, and the CEOs of several of the biggest banks including Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Artificial intelligence, the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the economic outlook were the main topics, and there was almost no mention of wars in the region on those panels. However, economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University gave a speech that was critical of the United States and Israel. "We don't need artificial intelligence in war, we need human intelligence to stop the wars," he said to applause. Sachs said Israel and the U.S. were blocking the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. "Until there is (a Palestinian state), there is going to be no peace in the region," he said speaking of wars in Gaza and Lebanon and concerns there may be a wider regional conflict. Elon Musk also joined the conference via videolink where he spoke about population decline, the need for "maximally truth seeking" artificial intelligence, and timing for sending space ships to Mars. He said he believed instead some AIs were being trained to be politically correct, with some being built with a "woke, nihilistic, in my opinion, philosophy." He estimated that by 2040, there could be billions of humanoid robots, priced between $20,000 to $25,000. That development could multiply the valuation of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), according to Musk. “Robotic taxis makes Tesla about a $5 trillion company," Musk said. "The Optimus Robot, I think, makes Tesla a $25 trillion company.” The Optimus robot is the humanoid robot under development by Tesla. U.S. ELECTION With just a week to go until America elects a new president, several panelists were asked who was more likely to win. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that markets expected Donald Trump to beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 but that the outcome remained "almost a coin toss". Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, who has endorsed Trump, initially said he wouldn't comment on the election before saying that Trump had a better understanding today of the how the presidency works than in 2016. There was also optimism about the global economy and among the bank CEOs about an increase in corporate dealmaking next year. Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley CEO, told another panel that the increase in activity would "be a global phenomenon", with bigger companies going public. Goldman boss David Solomon said he also expected more robust activity next year. Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) CEO Marc Rowan said a Trump victory would boost merger and acquisition activity that had been dampened by the current administration and lead to investment liberalisation. Several executives also voiced concern that inflation was more embedded globally than believed, even as central banks prepare to cut interest rates further. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said that the central bank policy "playbook" needed to be revisited because the transmission of higher rates to slow the economy had a greater lag as populations aged and due to changes in the housing market. "I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," he said.

Read more behind-the-scenes stories from Richie Zyontz here. My first boss in sports television once described a football broadcast as consisting of three primary elements. He cited commentary from the announcers as the first category — painting a picture with words. Then came live coverage and replays — painting a picture with pictures. It was the third component that took me by surprise — painting a picture and telling a story with words and numbers plastered on the screen. [Related: More from Tom Brady | More from Richie Zyontz] It was the world of graphics, and for more than 40 years, it has been the career starting point for many successful producers, directors and executives. Once upon a time, graphics in a football game consisted of very little. Down and yardage, player names attached to rudimentary statistics, and the score only when going to commercial. By today’s standards, it was almost criminally uninformative. So, when CBS Sports began a program in 1981 to upgrade the graphics on all their events, I was fortunate to be among the first group hired. Although I’m not sure why. A love and pretty deep knowledge of sports, perhaps. But being a security guard in the CBS headquarters known as Blackrock hardly qualified me for this new adventure. The first graphics truck I worked in consisted of four people. There was the broadcast associate (me) in charge of the editorial, the technician operating the graphics machine, a statistician, and a person on a headset getting scores from other games. A cozy little group huddled in a rental trailer with three or four monitors to work with. And maybe a donut or two. Now the graphics unit numbers a dozen people, dozens of monitors, and takes up an entire truck. A broadcast graphics truck is a much busier place these days than it used to be. (Photo courtesy of Richie Zyontz) Needless to say, that third key component of a sports telecast described to me way back in 1981 has grown by leaps and bounds, changed forever when FOX entered the network picture in 1994. FOX wanted its graphics to be the industry leader, with an emphasis on making a unique visual difference to what we put on the screen. The most lasting and significant of those innovations was the Fox Box, which keeps the score on constantly and from which many other stats are triggered. Mocked at the time by other networks, it has now been copied by everyone, 30 years later. FOX LEADS THE WAY IN GRAPHICS, AND TOM BRADY IS ALL IN The explosion of graphics on your screen coincides with the explosion of information now available to us. Once upon a time, research consisted of poring through team press releases. Not anymore. We have half a dozen sources of information at our fingertips each week. Tom Brady jumps on weekly phone calls with NFL Next Gen Stats and Pro Football Focus, two outstanding sources of sophisticated data. At our first offseason meeting with Brady, he didn’t seem particularly interested in making statistics a big part of his broadcasting repertoire. That has now changed. He is clearly excited about the information available to him and enthusiastically discusses and dissects this analytic data every week. Now, certain stats have not been kind to our crew. Of the games we’ve covered, the visitors have won 7 of 8, outscoring the home team by a cumulative score of 251-154. Through 8 weeks of the NFL season, 67 games have been decided by 7 points or fewer. Our crew has only seen two of them. But there is a silver lining, especially for a new broadcaster just learning the ropes. BRADY KEEPS HIS ENERGY UP IN A BLOWOUT, WHILE SEAHAWKS FIGHT THEMSELVES Maintaining energy is crucial to anyone wearing a headset. That's easier said than done when the game proves to be less than competitive. There are Hall of Fame broadcasters who sound bored when calling bad games. As a viewer, that’s poisonous. Considering how our first eight games have played out, my money is on Brady avoiding such bad habits. On a typical rainy day in Seattle this past Sunday, we were treated to another one-sided game, as the Buffalo Bills and their electric quarterback Josh Allen dismantled the Seahawks, 31-10. The rain and wind were a huge part of the story, and played right into Tom’s wheelhouse of experience playing in bad weather. Rain and wind (and hair in his eyes) couldn't slow down Josh Allen against the Seahawks. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images) As the game got out of hand, Kevin Burkhardt and Tom had opportunities for some great anecdotal conversations. For instance, Brady took time to praise the Bills Mafia while telling a story about how that same fan base would hang him in effigy when he was with the Patriots. It was a fun story that might not have been told during a close, exciting contest. Not for a second did anyone’s energy waver. Not in our booth and not on the field, where our drenched camera people found some incredible shots. They captured Seattle teammates fighting on the field and then on the bench from multiple angles. Our cameras caught the Seahawks scuffling with each other during the game. There were also tight under the helmet shots, which have long been the signature of our fabulous camera crew. With the steady rain falling, those shots were even more dramatic. My favorite picture, courtesy of our low end zone cameraman Andy Mitchell, was an extreme closeup of a football just before the snap, wet on one half, dry on the other. Beautiful! ON TO LAMBEAU, THE NFL'S BEST GAME-DAY ENVIRONMENT So now we move on to Green Bay for an NFC battle between the Packers and the Detroit Lions. Lambeau Field is the best game-day environment in the NFL. As usual, our graphics crew will be loaded with interesting numbers. Hopefully, we get to cover a close game, but if not, there’s always a silver lining. Richie Zyontz has been an NFL producer for FOX since 1994 and is in his 23rd season as lead producer. He boasts more than 40 years of experience covering the NFL.

Title: Bitcoin Tops $71,000—A 5-Month High—As Election, Inflation Questions Swirl

Bitcoin just hit its priciest level since the spring as several market conditions, including next week’s U.S. presidential election, impact the $1.4 trillion cryptocurrency. Trump gives a keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July. Bitcoin rose about 6% to as high as $73,544 at about 3 p.m. EDT, or 7 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time, Tuesday, the highest price for the token since March 14 (price movements in the 24/7 bitcoin market is most commonly measured in GMT). That moves bitcoin’s October gain to 13%, outstripping the leading American stock index S&P 500’s 1% advance this month. Other major digital assets rallied Tuesday, with ethereum up 4% to a 10-day high of $2.637, Binance coin up 2% to an eight-day high of $608 and Solana up 2% to a three-month high of $182. Also rallying were stocks of companies involved in bitcoin mining, the energy intensive process in which bitcoins are unlocked from the digital blockchain: Shares of Core Scientific, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms each gained Tuesday and are up at least 15% apiece in October. The bitcoin-led crypto rally is a confluence of several factors. Investors such as hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones have called on bitcoin as a hedge against inflation as the government and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump support policies that economists project will add trillions of dollars to the national debt. And with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last month, skeptics believe monetary policy may be ill-equipped to correct inflation. Prices for the more conventional safe haven asset, gold, have also jumped, with gold up 6% since the Sept. 18 rate cut. The rise in bitcoin prices have also coincided with climbing betting market odds for a Trump victory, as the previous bitcoin skeptic Trump positions himself as the pro-bitcoin candidate, calling for a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” And there’s continued upward pressure from the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved by U.S. regulators in January, which attracted billions of dollars of inflows from institutional investors into the digital asset, according to Bernstein research. $66 billion. That’s how much bitcoin is held by the spot bitcoin ETFs operated by legacy asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity and more digital-focused players like Grayscale, or about 5% of the global bitcoin market. Bitcoin is by far the most valuable crypto token with an aggregate market value more than four times that of the next biggest digital asset, ethereum, which in turn is more than three times larger than the third largest crypto token, Binance coin, excluding the stablecoin Tether. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,750 in March, and is up more than 300% from its late 2022 nadir during the “crypto winter,” when a string of high-profile bankruptcies for one-time titans in the industry, including the exchange FTX, shook confidence.

Title: Elon Musk Fans Are Losing So Much Money to Crypto Scams

Elon Musk isn’t just the richest person in the world, he’s also an investor in cryptocurrency. And the fact that Musk very publicly promotes crypto means a lot of people on social media don’t find it suspicious when they see videos of the billionaire promising to make them rich with some shady crypto investment. Deepfake videos of Musk hawking crypto are incredibly common on sites like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and X, leading people to lose obscene sums of money to scammers. And Gizmodo has obtained official complaints with the often shocking stories and we’re publishing them below. Gizmodo filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FTC to get complaints sent to the federal agency about crypto scams that pretend to be affiliated with Musk. We obtained 247 complaints, all filed between Feb. and Oct. of this year, and they’re filled with stories of people who believed they were watching ads for authentic crypto investments sanctioned by Musk on social media. The ads sometimes featured the names of Musk’s various companies, like SpaceX, Tesla, and X, while other times they utilized Musk’s association with neo-fascist presidential candidate Donald Trump. Musk, of course, endorsed Trump over the summer and has donated over $100 million to his own super PAC to get the former president re-elected. Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner filed a lawsuit Monday over Musk’s attempt to buy votes with his $1 million sweepstakes, but that’s an entirely different story Some people in the complaints believed they were talking directly with Musk, a sadly common story that has popped up in news reports before. But they weren’t talking with Musk, of course. They were communicating with scammers engaging in what’s called pig butcheringâthe name for a type of fraud popularized in the mid-2010s where scammers extract as much money as possible through flattery and promises of tremendous profits if the victim just “invests” where they’re told. There’s often a romance element to pig butchering, where the scammers pretend to be interested in a romantic relationship, but that was rare in the complaints Gizmodo obtained about Musk. More often than not, the marks are simply trying to make a quick buck and are sending money into completely fraudulent systems that make the victim think their money is sitting somewhere and growing. In reality, the public-facing portal is just smoke and mirrors with a number that changes at the whims of the scam artists. How much money did people lose? It’s actually kind of shocking when you read through the FTC complaints. People report losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a relatively short period of time. One person in Michigan who reported losing $700,000 to scammers explained they became suspicious “because I am not able to get information about the company, such as an address, email address or any other contact information except the phone number.” Another victim in Nevada who lost over $220,000 said they “saw a commercial featuring Elon Musk” that appeared “on either TikTok or Instagram” that was “asking people to join his AI trading platform.” The complaints have been redacted, striking them of any personal information, making it impossible for Gizmodo to track down the victims and verify their stories. But the sheer number of stories, and their similarities, make it worthwhile to look at even unverified claims to see what techniques scammers may be up to these days. While private information has been redacted by the FTC, there is useful information in the FOIA release that can help give context to where people are living and age ranges that help show who’s being victimized. Much like the scams we looked at on Truth Social earlier this month, most of the victims appear to be elderly. And that makes sense, if only because those people often have the most money to lose after a lifetime of saving. They’re also likely to have more access to their retirement accounts, though there is a complaint from one person in their 50s who lost over half a million dollars by draining their 401K, presumably prematurely. “This continued to happen until I depleted all my 401k that I had worked for 28 years to earn, leaving me with no nothing,” the complaint from North Carolina reads. “They continue to harass me asking me for more money saying that they have a plan to gain my money back.” There’s also the person in their 30s from Nevada who reported losing $32,000 while trying to find a YouTube video of Donald Trump doing a Fox News town hall. “I saw a video on YouTube supposedly about the Trump Town Hall with Hannity and this video of Elon Musk appeared talking about a crypto giveaway. Apparently it is a scam,” the complaint reads. The majority of the victims are from the U.S., and it’s natural that Americans would file complaints in their own country. But some of the complaints are from other parts of the world, including Canada and India. The thing they all have in common? The victims thought whatever they were investing in had Elon Musk’s seal of approval. Many of the scam website URLs have been redacted, but there are a handful that were still listed in the documents obtained by Gizmodo. One such website had been seized by the Kings County District Attorney in New York, according to the landing page, which we’ve captured below. Others were deleted entirely, but some, like elondonald.com, were still live at the time of this writing. Gizmodo is publishing some of the complaints below. Spelling and grammatical errors have been retained from the original. If you’ve been scammed on the internet and want to share your story you can email [email protected] In the end of June, 2023 I responded to Elon Musk’s day trading commercial on Instagram. I got a phone call from a person and started online trading with XT-BestSolutions. I’m dealing with one person [redacted] over the Viber phone services. He said he’s based in Barcelona, Spain. He guided me through the trading process daily on the XT-BestSolutions trading platform. He also guided me through the process of transferring my money from my US Huntington bank accountÂ through Crypto wallets to XT-BestSolutions trading platform. All transaction were made through different Sources to change US dollars to cryptocurrency. Starting on June 30, 2023 to current date, I transferred $700,000 to my XT-BestSolutions account. Through the process of online trading, XT-BestSolutions company credited me $200,000. Even though I still have more than $700,000 in my XT-BestSolutions trading platform account,Â I cannot withdraw any money back until I add $200,000 more to my XT-BestSolutions account to cover this additional credit, and after this (accordingly to what he saying) I will be able to withdraw all $900,000. Its become more suspicious to me because I am not able to get information about the company, such as an address, email address or any other contact information except the phone number and one person I communicating with. [redacted] My accountant has advised me to contact the FBI before I make anymore money transactions. [Redacted] was a victim of a crypto-currency investment scam by two scammers who identified themselves as [redacted] and Prof [redacted] in a WhatsApp chat group. He was instructed to download the WhatsApp after he click a link on Facebook that claimed to be Elon Musk looking forÂ people to invested in his AI business. The scammers instructed Henry to go on CSTT.co the online trading app and to udoBIT.com to complete several wire transfers. CSTT customer service and [redacted] instructed Henry to wire money to the Crypto.com and Cathay Bank. [redacted] completed 13 wire transfers that totaled to $618,000. Wire Transfers started on 11/29/23 through 01/03/24. [redacted] used the phone number [redacted] and Prof [redacted] used number [redacted]. I was online and saw the opportunity to invest in crypto funds, using AI algorithms and swing trading sponsored by Elon Musk in an effort to earn a few $100 a day.Â I was introduced to the Professor [redacted] and his assistant [redacted] who would be helping me in this.Â Originally, they furnished a trading account on the SILDGROUP platform with $100 to learn how to trade crypto currency with their guidance and instructions. Professor [redacted] was in charge of sending the trade signals and Assistant Sofia would explain how to trade and provide technical details. If I wanted to make more money, I was told I needed to have more in my account. I was encouraged to add more money if I wanted to reap higher profits, and in doing so I was earning more and more into my contract trading account.Â There were discussion group scenarios and we would meet at 4pm and 7pm EST each day to discuss financial scenarios going on in the US as well as in the crypto currency markets that would ultimately effect pricing. There were times of every few weeks that I would make a mistake and trade on the wrong coin, losing all the money that I had put in.Â I was given the impression that if I added money, they would help me make up what I had lost and gain more and more. This continued to happen until I depleted all my 401k that I had worked for 28 years to earn, leaving me with no nothing. They continue to harass me asking me for more money saying that they have a plan to gain my money back. We were scammed out of 233K over 4 months (From March 2024 to June 20, 2024) by organized criminal with online trading company called ICHCOIN.info leaded by: To trap investor with Elon Musk’s announcement of Quantum AI 4.0 on Facebook. Once clicked, new investor was invited to a WhatsApp school EIF Business School – Class session happened on every weekday, to teach about contract trading of crypto currency. Each student was credited $500 to trade with Quantum AI 4.0 signal when to trade and when to take profit. [redacted] and [redacted] acted as the Stock and Crypto analysis. [redacted] acted as the administrator and the Merchant acted as the customer service to match when there is wiring request from investors. They created different VIP groups to attract investors to wire money to join these VIP groups in order to get bigger benefit on each trading. They created fake crypto currency GMC, QPT and then MDV to lure investors. They force investors to borrow money from their school to buy crypto at Initial Coin Offer. when the investors sold those coins, they request to pay back that borrowed money in order to withdraw money. One I wired the money in, they won’t response to our requests and their website is no longer active. I saw a commercial featuring Elon Musk on either TikTok or Instagram asking people to join his AI trading platform. when I clicked on it I was added to a BlackRock AI smart contract trading ~79 WhatsApp group with over 200 members. I ignored it.Â I was then contacted about a week later via WhatsApp by a Lady with an accent named [redacted] at [redacted]: and she asked me to sign up atÂ https:www.globalcoinnexus.co So I started observing the text messages and one of the messages she sent was this : Warm reminder: Mr. Elon Musk has invited many professional analysts and trading experts from all over the world to participate in the Global Cryptocurrency Artificial Intelligence Trading Competition scheduled to be held in December. Steven Lee will represent BlackRocks London office in the Global Cryptocurrency Artificial Intelligence Trading Competition hosted by Elon Musk, and he needs more support and votes. Therefore, we invite you to join this discussion group, where we hope you can learn how to make money and receive your support and vote. 10/14/23, 9:33AM [redacted]: Here, Steven Lee will bring you the latest market money-making information. Findings from our financial research team are shared daily. These research results include: 1 The scope of Fed policy. How to invest in cryptocurrencies, forex, options, stocks and all financial markets amid the banking crisis and inflation 2 Which excellent companies and trading markets are worthy of our investment? Is short-term or long-term investment a better option? Whether you are a beginner ready to invest or a long-term investment friend, how to use the correct method to trade. How to achieve long-term and stable investment returns? Rest assured, as long as you stay here every day and carefully read the content shared in the discussion group, your wealth will definitely increase tremendously On 10/22/2023, I started with an initial capital of 0.03493077 BTC which was about 1061 USDT, and started trading. A couple of days later, Steven Lee introduced a special trading group called VIP Trading Group. The VIP trading group requires a min of 30,000 usdt. Gloria kept pushing me to invest more money to join. I tried and lost all my money. He introduced another Advanced VIP which required min 50,000 usdt. I tried that also and lost money. I kept adding more usdt just to recoup my losses.Â In all, I cashed out all my stock investments, and crypto, borrowed money, and took loans on my home trying to recoup my losses. I was finally able to recoup my money but when I tried to withdraw the money. They will not let me. The website is saying to wait for verification. I have contacted Gloria and Steven Lee but nobody will pickup or reply to my text messages. The tech support ignores me. I converted all the usdt back to BTC but can’t withdraw it. I need help in getting my money back to pay my creditors. I stumbled into this Crypto Futures Trading Group I April, 2024. There was an ad on Facebook, purportedly funded by Elon Musk guaranteeing to pay crypto investors $100K if they try his trading training program and are not a millionaire within 6 months. I clicked the link which ended up assigning me to a trading group named after Professor Keller. I was very wary at first but everything seemed legitimate and maybe it was. The team was very professional, Prof Keller provide two lectures daily, about 2 hours each. The trading logic seemed valid. In the beginning, [redacted], the Assistant, required me to join the trading platform, LFEX which she said was licensed to operate in Montana, where I live. The real reason was that LFEX was the platform they made all group members join, supposedly so everyone was using the same Exchange, fees and currencies would be the same, etc. Only one group trade that I participated in, led by [redacted] or [redacted], failed to earn profits. On average, trades by [redacted] earned 35 to 45, sometimes over 100. Trades by Prof K averaged maybe 60, with trades over 100 and 200 common.Â Prof K kept saying he was not 100 accurate in his trades. As training and trading progressed, whale activities in the marketplace increased. I personally was zeroed or almost zeroed by whales many times while practicing my trading. Other group members were having similar problems. Over time, the group wanted to know how to protect against whales. Prof K devised a Joint Trading Plan for us, incorporating students from his other trading groups so that essentially l, we became a special whale, each with their own account, instead of asking us to send him money so he could trade for all of us. Prof K said that once the Joint Trading Plan started which was this week, that he could 100 guarantee that we would earn massive profits trading in lower priced currencies between $100 to $500. This week, the plan officially launched. I think it was on Tuesday or Wed. when instead of 1 trade per day, Prof K decided to do 3 trades in the same day, all in the NAF currency. I myself has about $215K in my trading account at the time. By the time trading ended, because I had taken on extra risk in tradingÂ risked and maximized Open and Close times, I had in total, earned over 1,200 interest on my trades, ending up with an account total of ov $8.5M in my trading account. Apparently, some disgruntled member of the day trading group who was not included in our night trading because they did not meet the minimum funds requirement of $50K, reported our group to LFEX. Initially when LFEX froze my funds, they said I had broken trading laws as well as participated in activities to create market disruptions and control one or more currencies. They did not cite specifically what laws or Exchange rules I had broken. Later, I looked up their TermsÂ Conditions and determined I had not broken any trading laws. The market disruption rule was vaguely listed and there is no list of penalty fees or actions that will be taken if infractions occur. I notified LFEX that everything U had done as a trader in training was I believed, legal and within trading norms for the marketplace. I asked them to release my funds. They said I must first pay a 3 penalty fee using funds that are not in my trading account within 15 days or they will confiscate all of the money in my trading account. That seemed like extortion to me, since I really did nothing wrong. Butchered Fat Pigs Scam. While Attempting to research the juniper tesla model y that is due to be released In twenty twenty five. A live recording of Elon Musk at the annual crypto convention in nashville in front of an audience was stating that crypto currency in the way of the future. And that’s tesla uses this innovation within their company. They said that they had live help and websites. All you had to do was scan the q.R.Code on the screen And it would take you to the official website. Where then if you transferred euthereum doge orbitcoin, whatever you sent within ten minutes, you would have doubled back. Now, i’m an intelligent woman, at least I consider myself that to be. I am a huge fan of elon musk and tesla. I only bit into this because it did sound too good to be true. Because it was elon mask, and he was on stage and it was live, and it looked like him and it sounded like him and all his words promoting this technology was so believable and everything that I believe in. However, after I transferred my Bitcoin, which it fluctuates from day to day, but say, maybe around 80,000 sometimes it’s a 100, you know, a 100,000 it fluctuates, I realized I was being scammed and I sent my money from my wallet. I don’t know who I mean, obviously I have an address and II screenshot it the whole thing, and I have the. Re. The YouTube video, which I realized for days they were posting live. I reported over 25 videos to YouTube to shut them down and they just kept popping up. I wanna Sue YouTube. A $100,000 is a lot of money or 80000 or whatever it was at that time, one point something of Bitcoin. And I know, I’ll probably never get my money back, but I need to get this message out there that AI believe it was AI because it looked and sounded just like and it was in front of a live audience, and now I’m thinking the audience was fake, I do. I did record the video and I do have like the wallet that I sent it to the timing. I was screenshotting everything. But if someone can get back to me, I went to the state police, they took my I’ve complained, but I’ve never heard from anyone they said an investigator would reach out to me that didn’t happen. I also filed a complaint with the federal bureau. Cybercrime, haven’t heard from them either. Please someone reach out to me click on a link from Facebook that had Elon Musk introducing his new AI system for crypto investments. The link took me to 2 groups on WHATSAPP. The group was named Howard Mars Investment Group. This group introduced me to AKBCOIN fake Platform. I ended up setting up my Crypto.com account and wired money from my personal account. I then transferred tether to the fake site. The site manipulated transactions to seem as if I was trading but actually was not. I ended up transferring $80k to the site and once the site showed I made funds it wouldn’t allow the withdrawal. Then the customer service said I had to pay a take on my winnings in order to retrieve my funds. Once I sent them the funds, they still did not release the funds from the site. The group disbanded and so did the site. www.h5.akbcoin. com I watched an ad on Facebook from Elon musk. That should have been my first red flag They offered u money to learn how to trade and invest in crypto currencies Log in ctall trading platform create an account and start learning.Â So I did.Â I spoke to Caroline thru WhatsApp and in telegram.

East German. They are running an elaborate crypto trading scam, using a fake trading site disguised as CTALL platform. CTALL has an ip address listed as China. They lure you in with a fake video featuring Elon Musk. Caroline convinces you to join and wire money to your trading account. Professor Andrea publishes his daily bullshit about the crypto market and elementary trading tips for review. He then provides fake trading signals for members to follow. The trades are not real so he can make them show high profits to keep you excited. All this time, they are relentless about telling you to increase your account funds for more profits. After you have deposited a few thousand dollars cash into your trading account, they manipulate the leverage on your order to 200. Within seconds, your entire account is wiped out. They steal your money, but then pressure you to wire additional funds, saying you can make up your losses! More lies. Be careful not to get involved with these criminals. Once your money is gone it is highly unlikely you’ll get any of it back That is what I found on line It really sucks to find out you have been scammed They have a group on WhatsApp I was crypto-scammed by a phishing scammer. I went to a website where Elon Musk was talking about the coming age of cryptocurrency. It all seemed super real. Elon said he was offering a promotion. Whatever a person sent in, he would match in return. Just to help cryptocurrency establish sooner. It looked like a great opportunity, so I sent a Bitcoin. I realize now it was foolish to do so. I know now I had been conned and played emotionally. Never again. So they got my life savings. They got me for $57,000. I can’t believe it. I think many, many others were victims also of the same scam. On 8/12/24 Monday evening I was looking for the Elon Musk – Donald Trump Interview. I was brought to the phishing website trumplive.org. There, Elon Musk was discussing Cryptocurrency and the financial world to come. Truth is, it was very inspiring and well done. Then Elon offered to speed along Crypto by offering on any crypto contributed he would personally match the amount. I realize now this was a scam. I also realize now this was an AI generated Elon Musk. Caught up in the moment I seized the opportunity and sent them my .966 Bitcoin. What scams do is to sell people false-hope. Then they take advantage of you. He claimed to be the real Elon Musk. I shared personal info and financial information with him. He wanted to connect with his fans and carry them along in his career. He helped me invest in cryptocurrency to improve my financial situation.Â From his instagram profile, [redacted], where he contacted me, we then chatted on telegram, username [redacted], and most recently using the WhatsApp [redacted]. He had me purchase bitcoin through apps like cashapp, Binance, Cex.io and through a bitcoin atm. They were all sent to the company wallet id. He did trades to increase my profits. Any time I doubted him he reassured me everything was fine and he even sent me his drivers license. Any pics like that he shared would disappear after I viewed them so I was not able to save or screenshot them. I have screenshots of our conversations. When I wanted to make withdrawals from my investment account with him he required more money for different fees. This has gone on for months. He had me sign a document to be on the Tesla board, and I have a pdf of that document. He deposited a fraudulent check for 9,000 into my bank account using a previous check I had received for some work I did with horses. I have lost over 50,000 with this individual and am concerned for my safety. I am still in touch with him and he does not know I am reporting this fraud. I have been scammed by another crypto individual online involving ethereum and lost over 30,000. Elon wanted to help me recoup from that as well as that case overlapped timeframes with this one. I invested in a Scam that Elon Musk started by buying crypto currency, by 1st buying it for 300$, but before you know it I had invested 39,000$ American dollars. My 1st investment was with Delta Stock.ai. We were in close contact for a month. I had a chance to buy ( HFTs) high financial trades.the 3rd pick that they had blinking, I lost 28,000$ and the broker I had told me and my Wife that we had to come up with another,8000$ or we would lose all our investment. He blamed me for the decision that I made but he had the stock blinking and so I picked that stock. I was just wondering if there was anything that you could Help me with. Thank you for your time, please send me back an email when we can talk. Thank you I saw a video on Youtube supposedly about the Trump Town Hall with Hannity and this video of Elon Musk appeared talking about a crypto giveaway. Apparently it is a scam. trumpelon.io I sent over $30K. I am reporting this for my grandmother [redacted]. She is 77yrs old. She got on tiktok, met some person claiming to be Elon musk, convincedÂ her to start doing cryptoÂ to get some type of wallet. After that multiple people started scamming her. From tik tok, wassup app, eBay Cash app ect. She has loaded gift cards vanilla, apple, eBay. Sent money through cash app. She has gotten her socially security number stolen it’s all over the internet. She has gotten her social security check stolen. I really need help to stop these people from stealing her money she thinks all of this is real and it’s not. Please help my grandma,Â ban her from social media if you can. All her information for her scams are on her phone. Started with an ad on Instagram about investment learning that led me to join a WhatsApp group. A guru named [redacted] Vyas was guiding along with help his best student (b)(6) and assistant [redacted]). [redacted] usually provided daily inputs on stock market while [redacted] used to train people interested in Crypto and both also provided trading signals which were remarkably accurate. I only observed the guidance and signals for several weeks and realised that while stocks guidance was great the crypto profits were amazing. People were making 50 or 100 percent profits or more with each trade. I had no idea about crypto so I was initially wary of it but eventually got drawn to it. The group also eventually transformed to a crypto focussed group as more people felt the same way. This is where number of new people opened accounts in a trading app called CGL BMG on the insistence of [redacted]. [redacted] also provided information indicating how CGL BMG is reliable as it has an MSB License etc. All of this looked like a scam but a small deposit of around 200 dollars initially would limit the risk. I further went on to try withdrawal which seemed too slow but worked the first time. This brought in more trust towards the platform and my profits kept growing with some initial hiccups and increasing investment. This is also where it was understood within the group that [redacted] who is quite knowledgeable in investing and has such great accuracy using an AI based trading is actually doing some research and has partnerships with organisation’s like Elon Musk’s xAI. Of course not verified by me. This is also why crypto trading strategies kept changing each week and required higher investment for each new trading experiment. The last experiment called the Whale plan hadÂ several investment groups based on the amount of funds in USDT based on a minimum of 20k, 80k, 150k and so on. Higher profits for the higher investment slabs. I was at about 38k with my investment and profits and Aditi asked me to fund it up to 50k after which she would help me trade up to 80k so I could enjoy more profits. Now this was already difficult for me to go upto 50k as these are huge funds for me but I did and she helped me go up to a whopping 129k with a few trades. However now she suggested I add the remaining to go upto the 150k investment group instead of the 80k group. This made me strongly suspicious again and despite declining she insisted I should find a way to get there. I instead attempted to make a withdrawal of 4k, from my current total fundsÂ which are over 125k, to my Binance wallet where I had withdrawn before,but after 4 days past the withdrawal was failed. The reason was after lot of inquiry given as an anomaly in my withdrawal address which resulted in blocking the withdrawal function on my account. I was told to deposit 30 of the total funds in my account around USD 38051 to unfreeze the withdrawal mechanism. It is quite impossible for me to do this and I am now sure this is nothing but an attempt to squeeze more money out. I am helpless after investing most of my savings into this scam. Please help. I was watching a SpaceX rocket launch on YouTube with a friend.Â Elon Musk came out on the stage and began speaking to a crowd of people and said something to the effect of to celebrate today’s historic launch and to encourage the growth of crypto adoption, scan this QR code and send BTC or ETH or USDT (perhaps others but I don’t recall) to the wallet.Â We will reimburse you 2:1 any amount you send. Without checking to see if this was a scam I logged into my Kraken wallet and sent 6.5 ETH to the address.Â Almost instantaneously I realized this was fraud but could not stop the transaction. I listened to prominent individuals’ advice ( Justin Trudeau, Elon Musk etc) on line about investing in crypto currencies and I decided to invest. I was told by Maria Diaz, (who claimed that she was assigned as my accounts manager, after I refused to invest initially), that I would have a weekly income from my investment. I was given an account on line where where I was allowed to track my investment. The returns were exceptionally good, so after a while I decided that I should start retrieving income. I was then told by the aforementioned Maria Diaz that I could not. When I reminded her about our conversation about the weekly income she cut me off and closed the page on the internet. I have since been unable to get to them, as they don’t answer the phone. They have subsequently been calling me ( his name is [redacted]) from Taura Capital to help me get back my investment, but I have to send them more money to pay some fees to the person at their Accounts Dept. to do the job. I am still getting these phone calls coming in almost everyday. I clicked on an Instagram ad featuring Elon Musk discussing AI in crypto options trading. Shortly after, I was contacted by an [redacted] who introduced me to Professor [redacted] via WhatsApp. Since then, I obtained what appears to be a fake New York State driver’s license for Parker, listing the address as 143 West 57th Street, which is actually the Park Hyatt New York at 153 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019. I deposited funds to a crypto address [redacted], which later changed to [redacted], and I suspect it will continue to change. When I tried to transfer the money back, [redacted] stopped this, claiming the only way to retrieve my funds was by joining a VIP group with a minimum investment of $50,000. I refused to do this, so I traded in the account and grew the funds to USDT 115,415.82. However, when I attempted to transfer the funds out, I was blocked again and told I couldn’t access the profits without making the additional investment, confirming my suspicions. These people need to be stopped to prevent more individuals from being scammed in the future. Here is the last part of today’s conversation 7/3/24, 18:19:51 [redacted]: You have till FridayÂ to do so then its FBI time 7/3/24, 18:21:28 [redacted]: This is my rule. I am not afraid of the FBI. You cannot withdraw funds because you have not met the conditions. So this is your own problem and has nothing to do with me. 7/3/24, 18:21:50 [redacted]: I will report everything to the FBI. 7/3/24, 18:22:44 [redacted]: Yes show me where you conveyed those conditionsÂ your not a smart as you think 7/3/24, 18:23:06 [redacted]: We will get to you in the end 7/3/24, 18:23:47 [redacted]: Therefore, the FBI will put the blame on you, saying that it is your own fault that you cannot withdraw your money. 7/3/24, 18:24:37 [redacted]: Legally you don’t have a foot you never gave the terms and conditions in writing 7/3/24, 18:24:37 [redacted]): Remember, it’s your own fault. 7/3/24, 18:25:05 [redacted]: No, you’re a fraudster 7/3/24, 18:25:23 [redacted]: OK, from now on you will no longer be able to learn and trade in my group 7/3/24, 18:25:46 [redacted]: Olivia is about to remove you from the group 7/3/24, 18:26:14 [redacted]: good your digging a deeper hole for yourself 7/3/24, 18:26:46 [redacted]: You need to add funds again before you can withdraw 7/3/24, 18:27:20 [redacted]): The tokens you trade don’t exist anywhere else and it’s impossible to trade them else where your bitcoin doesn’tÂ match the market ticker all bullshit 7/3/24, 18:27:47 [redacted]: I did not force anyone to invest or trade. Everyone&#39;s investment and trading was voluntary. 7/324, 18:28:43 [redacted]: [redacted] has removed you 7/3/24, 18:28:56 [redacted]: If i add1 Dollar ill never see it again if you are an honest person and prove to me that i can trusty you, you would let me withdraw to show good faith then I would trust you, but I can’t all you are doing is holding me to ransom 7/3/24, 18:29:30 [redacted]: I’ll say it one last time, you must add funds again to make a withdrawal 7/3/24, 18:29:48 [redacted]: Before that, don’t contact me. 7/3/24, 18:30:25 [redacted]: that’s fine it makes no difference i can’t get to the money anyway My one last time return my money and all the data will be handed over Friday I was reached out to as Elon Musk CEO on IG and later on Whats app! later on on Telegram channel under Elon Reev Musk He told me about the platform: www. starlinkmining.com His Bit CoinÂ Mining platform! I waited for 2 weeks and then saw the real Elon Musk with woads of cash in his hands from the mining platform on my iphone! I didnt understand where it was streaming from! so I contacted the website because I thought Elon Musk has approved of it! That was the only reason!!! so I invested $18000. I meant to only invest $2000 and then cash out and see if it was possible! But their pressure sell tactics over came me! They use paypal and Zell, Venmo, try to open account on ,started cash app s andÂ connected to my Bank, down loaded all crypto wallets , and block chaines to withdraw theÂ money from ! it took 2 months all together! It took over 8 -10 hours a day to be able to withdraw money from my accounts due to security measures I had placed on my accounts! They are so smooth and sophisticated thatÂ make you open your cash app accounts in front of them and follow their instructions to withdraw money money from you accounts and send it to these unknown people the miners .Â Everytime I said I don’t to invest anymore he would say Ok! you can start withdrawingÂ anytime !Â When you sign up there are 2 sites you deal with! one is the platform and the other one is you account platform. where you get a login! and once you go in you will see the amount invested and several other boxes that show how much you have made real time,also there is a chat boxÂ that answers any needs or questions. everyone has to have an account manager who leads you in how to to invest! In my case Elon Musk!!!Â When it came to withdrawing, I was told by the accounts website chat that I need to pay $15000.00 for cash out of $170000.00! when I asked what are the charges pertaining to, they said its the IRS rulesÂ that they are collecting for the IRS! I did a search the company is a UK company ! I reported to my account manager and told him this doesn’tÂ sound right! and blocked him! another week went by and the account websiteÂ emailed me and said that the IRS fee was paid by my account manager and to call him to start cashing out! eager that I was to get my own money back I contacted him on whats app and he said ok and lets cash out! I gave filled out a form onÂ the website that seemed like a regular wire form from my bank and gave them the account number to wire the money to. everything was going great until they toldÂ me you need a pin number in order to receive the money in you bank! and for me that fee was $1500. Un willing to pay a dime I declined and blocked my manager again. Later on he tried on Instagram to reach me but I blocked him there to!Â I am reporting this to letÂ you know how sophisticated these people are.Â There are lots and lots of impersonators of Elon Musk out there specially on social media X and IG forÂ sure and for people like me the victims!Â I am 60 years old and know about technology enough to follow them and I could tell how smart they are! they truly are! on Facebook, I found an ad that supposedly Elon musk and his team created quantum AI and if you join the investment club youll make money. This AI created Elon Musk even stated that if he didnt make $1 million and six months he would give you a Tesla, so I followed the link and signed up with a company called Frank Barbara, crypto trade chamber. I watched i the trading for two or three weeks before I started sending money to my crypto wallet, and then sent from the crypto wallet to the trading platform called vencoinss.com. I sent them $10,000 to their bank account in California and started trading and they sent me the $10,000 back as I was making so-called profits. I felt confident that this was OK so I sent $17,000 in USD to the trading account. I built the account up to $64,000 with my 17,000 and the rest fake profit. Then I was about to send them more money when a trade happened that I lost $69,000 that wiped out my account and I knew it was a scam because the trade was with MSH crypto which is worth less than a dollar and I lost 69,001 trade using $6500 in funds for the trade I have documentation on WhatsApp of all my trades and the so-called administrator. My name is [redacted] and my phone number is [redacted], my email address is [redacted] , I want to see this so-called company put out a business so nobody else loses any money. Elon Musk and I have been communicating through text messaging since June 2023.Â He first got me talked into investing Apple Gift Cards in the amount of $500 each.Â His promise was to pay me half of the investment accumulating interest at Crypto Currency Account in BTHÂ ETH and a new Tesla car.Â The rest was supposed to help pay for our wedding.Â At first I thought it was an imposter.Â But latter Elon sent me voice messages, several oaths of loving me and I have talked with Elon on the phone several times.Â Just to verify it was really him.Â Before I reported anything I was in wonder whether anyone would beleive me.Â But after Elon got his Billion Dollar Package deal, his demeanor changed towards me.Â He got all my SSDI check this past June and has left me owing for my July rent and withdrew all the money on his Birthday the 28th.Â Valued at over $700,000.00.Â Without wire transfering it to my account.Â He also used my ID.me account verification access codes.Â To verify my Identity and created that Cryptocurrency account using my name.Â I have screenshots on the balancees.Â To show we conversed alot and would talk for hours about our building our money up so we would have a good future together.Â Now last I seen on Facebook…hes in Dubai with some young girl.Â And Im scared Im going to end up homeless without his helps.Â I dont know what to do about it. UPDATE 07/18/2024 Consumer is calling to report that she is receiving death threats from someone. Consumer reported that she is being stalked by his girlfriend. Consumer is referred to the local police department. I answered an ad saying that they use Elon Musk AI trading recommendations. Its run by two people [redacted] and [redacted]. Its on a what’s app chat room. I deposited first a $1,000. into the ECOS account and made some money using Patrick’s recommendations. By the way the profits were over 50 almost all of the time, that was the first red flag. So [redacted] talked me into putting another $8,000 into my account so i could join the 10X Bull Market Multiplier. So with the first deposit and second one i had $9000. and the profits of $1000 i had enough to join the 10X program. [redacted] said the 10X program would return 10 times my money. The only thing was i couldn’t take any of the profits out until the program was over on February 15th plus i had to give them 10 fee and the profits couldn’t be used to pay them. This was my second red flag. I figured the profits everyone was making was about as real as the dinosaurs on Jurassic Park. I then told [redacted] I didn’t want to be in the 10X program and she removed me. At this point i wanted my money back, so i started a withdrawal from my ECOS account on 2/8/2024 in the amount of $10,785 and haven’t received it yet. The money was sent by Crypto.com to ECOS in the crypto funds of USDT. Please see that there people who have about 800 people investing with them. I figure after they get the 10 the site will go dead and nobody’s going to get there money.. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: "Tackling Obesity": NHS & Eli Lilly Announce Mounjaro Clinical Trial in UK - The HighWire

Updated 5:19 AM EDT, Tue October 29, 2024 By Tracy Beanz & Michelle Edwards Obesity is not just an epidemic in the United States. It torments those living in Great Britain, too, where the most obese patients cost the National Health Service (NHS), one of the nation’s most praiseworthy institutions, an average of $2,416 a year. The health impact of obesity in Britain is significant—it is the second largest preventable cause of cancer and costs the NHS roughly $14 billion a year. Speaking up about the growing problem, British Member of Parliament (MP) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting recently stated that “widening waistbands” burdened the NHS. But, eureka, Streeting has found a “game-changing” solution. Without question, obesity wrecks one’s health, so what is Streeting’s scheme? Lo and behold, under Streeting’s lead, NHS has partnered with Lilly—the world’s largest pharmaceutical company—in a $360 million investment deal from the drug manufacturing giant to perform real-world trials of its star obesity jab Mounjaro on the unemployed. Streeting, who also serves as a Vice President of the Local Government Association and patron of LGBT+ Labour, pleaded his case in The Telegraph on October 14, 2024. Noting that “as a country, we’re eating more, eating less healthily, and exercising less.” A month before that, citing long waits for treatment, crumbling hospitals, mental health patients in “vermin-infested cells,” and far fewer MRI scanners than comparable countries, a recent government-commissioned report declared the 75-year-old NHS is in “critical condition.” With Britain’s new prime minister Keir Starmer insisting the NHS has reached a critical “reform or die” position, Streeting wrote in The Telegraph: “Our widening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service, costing the NHS £11 billion a year—even more than smoking. And it’s holding back our economy. Illness caused by obesity causes people to take an extra four sick days a year on average, while many others are forced out of work altogether. For years, governments have ducked the serious, long-term policy decisions required to tackle its debilitating effects. Fears of being labeled “nanny state” have meant nothing has been done, and the problem has only gotten worse. As with most of the issues we inherited, this Government recognises that we can only do so much. It will require working in partnership with business, civil society, and all of us as citizens to make real progress – that’s what Sir Keir Starmer’s mission-driven Government is about.” What is the “mission-driven” Government described by newly anointed British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the democratic socialist’s Labour Party? And what does “reform or die” ultimately look like? In mid-October, in what is surely a deep-state dream come true, Starmer teamed up with King Charles, Elton John, and a Michelin chef to “woo” the world’s most powerful bosses—the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, along with the heads of Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays and Brookfield—to secure roughly $82 billion in foreign investment pledges. Prior to Starmer’s star-studded evening, in September, The Telegraph wrote that Starmer was preparing a raft of “nanny state” interventions on public health as he “races to save the NHS from collapse.” Indeed, the UK’s healthcare system, which provides universal health coverage to UK residents and non-residents with a European Health Insurance Card, faces numerous challenges. Funded by general taxation, the NHS is typically known for providing a high standard of care, yet it is currently “flashing red” on nearly all performance measures. Hmm, it seems like the millions from Lilly, along with the billions it is seeking from the likes of BlackRock and others, will certainly help to facilitate “reform.” Dr. Phil Banfield, chairman of the council at the British Medical Association, depicts a dreadful state of affairs at the NHS, remarking that the “crisis is now and the crunch is today,” adding, “investing in medical schools while refusing to reverse years of pay erosion is illogical.” Banfield explained that the NHS is not where it is today due to the pandemic or new economic challenges precipitated by war in Europe; instead, he insists, “we’ve been warned of catastrophe for 10 years, it’s now arrived.” According to Banfield, “this devastation has been wrought by successive UK governments.” Presently, short on clinicians, the NHS has published the first ever Long Term Workforce Plan, backed by over USD 3.1 billion in Government funding to deliver “the biggest training expansion in NHS history alongside measures to improve culture, leadership, and well-being.” Apparently, controversial and dangerous weight loss jabs like Mounjaro are part of the plan to achieve well-being. “We are calling on some of the world’s leading scientific minds and research institutions to help us succeed,” Streeting proclaimed when announcing the significant investment from Lilly to shape up Britain’s healthcare predicament. He added that the five-year real-world study Lilly will operate with its weight loss jabs could be monumental in Britain’s approach to tackling obesity, which will, in turn, help people get back to work and ease the toll obesity takes on the NHS. Specifically, the study will examine the “real-world” effectiveness of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) on weight loss, and on preventing diabetes and obesity-related complications. Researchers will also measure how the drug affects a patient’s employment status and the number of sick days they take. To get Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro weight-loss program underway, the NHS, which is also “tackling obesity” with efforts like the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, has proposed that those who need it most should get it first. Britain hopes to give the jabs to 250,000 NHS patients over the next three years. Mounjaro was approved for use in the UK last year. Still, Lilly held off on its launch until its pre-filled injection device called Kwikpen was endorsed by the country’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The product has been cleared for both type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. In yet another example of Big Pharma profiting from the destruction of public health, Lilly reported worldwide sales of Mounjaro, approved by the FDA in 2022, at $5.2 billion in 2023. Analysts project its sales will rise sharply through the rest of the decade, with sales expected to reach a staggering $34 billion by 2029. But common sense must prevail. Big Pharma isn’t the solution to fix any healthcare crisis and quite literally has no desire to be. Unsafe weight loss jabs like Mounjaro must not become the overarching anecdote to the obesity crisis that has taken hold of both Britain and the United States. Having said that, it will be interesting to see how this move, which feels eerily similar to a social credit score, plays out in Britain. Noting that the “eligible population” for the Lilly obesity study is actually in the millions, Dr. Dolly van Tulleken, obesity policy specialist at the University of Cambridge, remarked: “[There are] some serious ethical, financial and efficacy considerations with such an approach … Such as looking at people, or measuring people based on their potential economic value, rather than primarily based on their needs and their health needs. It’s incredibly important that people in the UK access healthcare based on their health need rather than their potential economic value.” Tracy Beanz is an investigative journalist with a focus on corruption.

Title: These 3 Energy Closed-End Funds Are Still On Sale

Oil pumps and graph If you’re as bullish on oil as I am, let’s look past vanilla bean favorites like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Great companies but a bit pricey, as they only yield 3% to 4%. We’re better off with diversified energy funds that dish dividends up to 9%. Now we’re talking! The conditions are right for another push ahead in energy’s crash-‘n’-rally cycle. The Middle East (‘nuff said). The Federal Reserve careening towards a “no landing” scenario. And the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) joining the global money printing party. It could be high time for Texas tea’s next leg higher. To celebrate, let’s review three closed-end funds (CEFs) that yield 7% to 9% and trade at discounts up to 11%. The BlackRock Energy & Resources Trust (BGR) owns energy equities—integrated energy majors, exploration and production (E&P) firms, distribution companies and more. It’s diversified from a geographic standpoint; 70% of the fund is invested in American firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), while the remaining 30% is dedicated to international energy stocks including the U.K.’s Shell (SHEL) and France’s TotalEnergies (TTE). The tight portfolio of fewer than 30 holdings isn’t surprising for an actively managed fund, but BGR is really top-heavy, with Exxon accounting for more than 20% of assets (yikes!) and Shell another 10% or so. Also, while many CEFs are happy to use debt to crank up their exposure, BGR doesn’t use a cent of leverage. But this BlackRock fund does have a few familiar CEF traits. It pays monthly distributions, which we won’t find in basic sector ETFs. It also trades at a nice 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV), which is a slightly deeper bargain than its ~10% five-year average discount. Most importantly, BGR trades options. Specifically, management uses a covered call strategy, which is how it manages to squeeze a 7% yield out of the same companies that fund the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLE) 3%-plus yield without debt leverage. Is it a better way to invest in energy? BGR’s primary quality is guarding against downside (thanks to the covered calls), but even then, it hasn’t delivered much protection during really precipitous drops. In the meantime, we enjoy oh so much less of the upside. Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO) is another largely straightforward energy-sector CEF, though it’s far more established. This fund came to life in 1929, meaning it’s all of about five years away from celebrating its centennial. It also has a storied distribution history, paying its shareholders for more than 80 years (and yielding 9.1% today!). PEO has a wider portfolio than BGR, at just less than 60 holdings, and it’s chock full of energy blue chips such as Exxon, Chevron, Schlumberger (SLB) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC). Oddly, though, it also has substantial (14%) exposure to chemicals firms like Linde (LIN), and a peppering of other industries, such as metals, mining, containers/packaging and construction materials. But it’s arguably more buttoned up than the BlackRock fund. It does utilize leverage, but a trace amount of it (sub-1%). Nor does it trade options. The result is nothing to scream about, but PEO does offer occasional bursts of outperformance. PEO Outperforms, Sometimes The 11% discount to NAV is a little misleading, too. We’re buying its assets on sale, sure, but we can do better—PEO’s average discount over the past five years is above 14%. Of course, most of us know if we really want income out of the energy space, we need to forget plain-Jane integrated majors and E&P firms, and instead look toward the infrastructure providers. Specifically, master limited partnerships (MLPs). The bulk of CEFs investing in the energy space are concentrated in MLPs. Among the most interesting is ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO), which is happy to own midstream firms (read: pipelines, storage, terminals, etc.) in partnership and corporation form. But its portfolio is thick in MLPs, including top 10 holdings such as Energy Transfer LP (ET), MPLX LP (MPLX) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). EMO gives us plenty to digest here. The fund does what CEFs tend to do—despite a modest 6% in leverage, EMO acts like a more exaggerated version of an index fund, booming when basic MLP ETFs are up, and languishing when they’re down. As a result of its run since 2020, EMO isn’t all that cheap. Yes, its assets are trading at 90 cents on the dollar. But we can do better—it has traded at an average discount of 16% over the past five years, including a stint near that average earlier in 2024. It’s also more than meets the eye. EMO actually merged with two funds—ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund, and ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Total Return Fund—in early September, and a couple weeks later, the company announced that Chris Eades would step down from the portfolio management team effective as of the end of 2024. And snuck into the middle of all that? An upgrade to monthly dividends. Want an example of just how disrespected CEFs are? If we go to just about any data provider, they’ll tell us that EMO yields around 3% right now. But it doesn’t! More than a month removed from a change to the fund’s dividend policy, and they’re still calculating the new 33-cent payout on a quarterly basis (3%) rather than monthly (9%). The monthly dividend is certainly more aligned with investors’ interest, but we have to be careful here. Even plain-vanilla index funds like the InfraCap MLP ETF (AMZA) deal with dividend declines; unlike traditional companies that will maintain a specific dividend level, MLPs’ distributions tend to shift with their profits. With EMO, that dynamic is exaggerated, leaving us with larger fluctuations in payouts over time. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Miami’s Tech-Leasing Boom Peaks as Projects Stall and Companies Balk

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The 8,300-square-foot office in Miami Beach marked Andreessen Horowitz’s latest bet. Long one of the biggest players in Silicon Valley, the venture capital firm had signed a lease at Starwood Capital Group’s swanky headquarters building in 2022. The deal showed Andreessen Horowitz’s commitment to remake the Miami region into a leading tech hub. But less than two years later, the firm, which made a name for itself with early investments in Facebook, Instagram and Airbnb, took an L on its South Florida bet. It abruptly closed the office — cutting short its lease by three years — while expanding its base on the West Coast. As the pandemic has wound down, so has the Miami region’s bid to become the next Silicon Valley, at least for now. Interest in cryptocurrency, which local leaders touted, particularly in Miami proper, has cratered. Venture capital investments in Miami have plunged. Tech leasing is down, with developers failing to land anchor tech tenants to launch new office buildings. All the while, San Francisco, despite the grumbles of top tech executives over its liberal politics and crime rate, has managed to stay on top, thanks to the emergence of the artificial intelligence industry. “Let’s just be frank about it: We were mixing the Kool-Aid without the capital,” said Miami-based venture capitalist Jeff Ransdell. “It’s like having a Ferrari in your garage with no gas.” In the beginning, though, there was no shortage of excitement. Fed up with Bay Area liberals and locked up in their houses at the onset of the pandemic, conservative tech executives wanted an alternative. Miami became the answer. Unlike California, the Magic City and its host state offered unrestricted living, sunny weather and low taxes. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez turned into an overly supportive cheerleader, coaxing tech leaders to move. As they poured in, the newly minted transplants proudly extolled the city’s benefits. Bars in Miami Beach, Wynwood and Brickell hosted tech-themed happy hours nearly every night. Altogether, the hype created something of a movement and helped put Miami on the map as a budding tech hub. “That type of community and structure brought seriousness to the Miami market,” said David Seifer, a Miami-based lawyer who runs Bilzin Sumberg’s corporate practice, specializing in tech companies. Miami made great progress. Microsoft and Apple, new-to-market tech giants, signed 50,000-square-foot leases in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Wynwood, a mural-filled neighborhood, emerged as a startup destination, attracting venture capital firms Atomic and Founders Fund, the latter of which was started by billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. Spotify opened a 20,000-square-foot Latin American headquarters, also in Wynwood, three years ago. Amazon remains in the market. The e-commerce heavyweight is in advanced negotiations to take between 60,000 and 80,000 square feet at L&L Holding Company and Oak Row Equities’s Wynwood Plaza development, which remains under construction, according to sources familiar with the pending deal. Miami went all in on cryptocurrency, too. The city hosted the Bitcoin 2021 conference, which drew about 12,000 attendees, making it one of the first mass gatherings in the U.S. after the COVID lockdowns. FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange run by now-imprisoned Sam Bankman-Fried, won the naming rights for the city’s waterfront NBA arena as part of a $135 million deal. The City of Miami, at the behest of its mayor, created its own digital coin. But just two years into Miami’s experiment, crypto crashed (and has only mildly recovered). The meltdown dealt a stinging blow to Miami’s mission to shed its unserious, party-centric image. Interest rates were also steadily rising, which made it difficult for startups to raise capital and grow. This year, venture capital funding for Miami-based companies is on track to plummet, having recorded only $1 billion in deals during the first six months — a far cry from the $5.5 billion raised throughout 2022, according to data from Pitchbook. Office landlords that had banked on tech tenants have taken a hit, including Brick & Timber Collective. In 2022, the San Francisco-based investor purchased the Cube Wynwd, an eight-story office building in Wynwood, for $62 million, with Blockchain.com set as the anchor tenant. But the cryptocurrency tenant never moved in to its 22,000-square-foot office. Within four months of Brick & Timber’s purchase, the leasing brokers sued the landlord to receive their commission. The lender of the nearby Gateway at Wynwood office building sued the owner, R&B Realty Group this year, after it allegedly failed to pay back $102 million in debt, despite landing notable tech tenants, such as OpenStore, a startup cofounded by Keith Rabois, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist who became perhaps the loudest and proudest proponent of Miami tech. Wynwood as a whole has yet to recover. While the Biscayne corridor, which includes Wynwood, boasts some of Miami-Dade County’s highest asking rents, averaging $70.79 a square foot, it also boasts one of the county’s highest vacancy rates, hovering just shy of 20 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield (CWK)’s latest data. So far this year, tech leasing across Miami-Dade County has slowed, generating 111,661 square feet in deals — less than half the previous year, which nabbed 227,717 feet in lease agreements, per C&W. The sluggish leasing pace has slowed the office development pipeline across town. During the height of the tech frenzy, developers were quick to announce office projects. Years later, many have yet to materialize. In perhaps the most public snafu, Stephen Ross’s Related Companies partnered with Swire Properties to develop an 80-story office skyscraper in the heart of Brickell, which could have become the city’s tallest building. So far, the joint venture has failed to secure an anchor tenant or reach a 30 percent pre-lease benchmark, typical requirements for lenders before they fund construction. “Miami is not a market that routinely signs 200,000-square-foot office leases. It’s not like New York City or Chicago,” Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Miami-based 13th Floor Investments, said during Commercial Observer’s annual South Florida development and investment event in Miami this month. “A big lease in Miami is 40,000 square feet.” Tech companies, especially startups, don’t always have good credit ratings. Even smaller, 150,000-square-foot office projects, spearheaded by high-profile developers Goldman Properties and Dacra, have yet to break ground, despite being announced two years ago. In the meantime, San Francisco and its surrounding region are staging a tech comeback. While still struggling with a glut of empty offices, artificial intelligence has breathed new life into the area’s tech scene and office market, accounting for more than 1.7 million square feet in leasing in the city alone since 2022. To level up, Miami is missing some key elements. For one, it doesn’t have the same breadth of tech investors as the Bay Area, according to Ransdell, who founded Miami-based Fuel Venture Capital in 2016. “You can have all the ideas in the world, but without the investor fueling that, it never happens,” the venture capitalist said. The region also lacks world-class universities. The Bay Area boasts Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley, which provide a steady pipeline of new entrepreneurs and sought-after hires. Even though the number of tech-centric jobs has grown in South Florida since 2020, companies are still struggling to fill all their open positions, making them hesitant to commit to years-long office leases, according to Alexandra Poses, an urban strategist at South Florida consulting firm The Euclid Group, who has studied tech hubs. It takes time to blossom into a tech mecca. “Silicon Valley has been around for 50 years, and Miami is only just emerging as a tech hub,” Poses added. Thanks in part to its proximity to New York, Miami’s recent quest to become the Wall Street of the South has fared better. The city landed the global headquarters of Ken Griffin’s sister companies, hedge fund Citadel and market maker Citadel Securities, from Chicago. The billionaire plans to build a 54-story headquarters tower, designed by world-famous architect Norman Foster, along Brickell’s waterfront. A slew of other high-profile financial firms also expanded their presence in Miami during the pandemic, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Millennium Management and Point72 Asset Management — all of which are headquartered in New York. For others, however, these rebranding efforts, whether it be tech or finance, are nothing new for Miami. “There’s always a new fad that gets people excited. They use that to sell condos and to generate investment interest for office space,” said Peter Zalewski, a condo analyst and longtime resident of South Florida. “But, at the end of the day, it always craps out. “It’s like taking two steps forward, one step back. That’s how you progress when you’re a young community that’s 125 years old.” Julia Echikson can be reached at jechikson@commercialobserver.com.

Offers advisors the convenience and simplicity of a bond ladder within an ETF NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) announced plans to expand its iShares ® iBonds ® ETF franchise with a suite of defined maturity bond ladder ETFs. The iShares iBonds 1-5 Year Ladder ETFs aim to offer advisors the convenience and simplicity of a bond ladder within an ETF. In 2010, BlackRock pioneered defined maturity ETFs with the introduction of iBonds ETFs, helping advisors build bond ladders and efficiently manage multiple client accounts, said Karen Veraa, Head of U.S. iShares Fixed Income Strategy at BlackRock. The iShares iBonds Ladder ETFs will be a seamless extension to the iBonds franchise, seeking to provide a turnkey solution to bond laddering while making investing easier and more affordable. This approach will simultaneously offer advisors and their clients the ability to manage interest rate risk, seek higher yields, and enhance portfolio diversification. Fund Name Index Name Ticker Exchange iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year Treasury Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year Treasury Ladder Index LDRT NYSE Arca iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year TIPS Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year TIPS Ladder Index LDRI NYSE Arca iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year Corporate Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year Corporate Ladder Index LDRC NYSE Arca iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year High Yield and Income Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year High Yield and Income Ladder Index LDRH NYSE Arca The iShares iBonds 1-5 Year Ladder ETF suite will consist of four fund of funds across U.S Treasuries, investment grade, high yield, and TIPS. The ETFs will seek to track a BlackRock index that consists of an equal 20% allocation to five iShares iBonds ETFs in their respective asset classes spanning five consecutive termination years. Each index will be reconstituted and rebalanced annually by replacing the iShares iBonds ETF that terminates in the current year with one that terminates five years forward and assigning equal weights to each constituent. With over $32 billion in assets under management, the iShares iBonds ETF franchise spans several asset classes, including U.S. Treasuries, municipals, investment grade, high yield, and TIPS. Since inception, BlackRock has launched 88 iShares iBonds ETFs, with 53 still active. 1 BlackRock manages over $1 trillion in fixed income ETFs globally, up nearly 40% since 2021.2 As of October 28, 2024, the registration statements of the Funds are effective but not yet available to trade. BlackRock intends to launch the Funds before the end of year. About BlackRock BlackRock's purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. As a fiduciary to investors and a leading provider of financial technology, we help millions of people build savings that serve them throughout their lives by making investing easier and more affordable. For additional information on BlackRock, please visit www.blackrock.com/corporate | Twitter: @blackrock | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/blackrock About iShares iShares unlocks opportunity across markets to meet the evolving needs of investors. With more than twenty years of experience, a global line-up of 1400+ exchange traded funds (ETFs) and $4.2 trillion in assets under management as of September 30, 2024, iShares continues to drive progress for the financial industry. iShares funds are powered by the expert portfolio and risk management of BlackRock. Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. The iShares iBonds ® Laddered ETFs (the Funds) are fund of funds and seek to track the investment results of a BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year Ladder Index (the Underlying Index). The Underlying Indexes are composed exclusively of underlying iShares iBonds ETFs (iBonds ETFs or Underlying Funds) (as determined by BlackRock Index Service, LLC (the Index Provider) that themselves seek investment results corresponding to their own underlying indexes. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in the value of debt securities. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the debt issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. TIPS can provide investors a hedge against inflation, as the inflation adjustment feature helps preserve the purchasing power of the investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed rate bonds and will likely decline in price during periods of deflation, which could result in losses. Government backing applies only to government issued securities, and does not apply to the funds. The iShares ® iBonds ® Ladder ETFs will hold 5 iBonds ETFs (the Underlying Funds), spanning 5 consecutive maturity years. The Underlying Index is reconstituted each June such that the iBonds ETF with the nearest maturity is removed from the Underlying Index and the iBonds ETF with a five-year maturity is added. If an iBonds ETF is not available for a given maturity year within the five-year range, the Underlying Index will hold fewer iBonds ETF constituents. An investment in the Fund(s) is not guaranteed, and an investor may experience losses, including near or at the reconstitution date. Unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, the Fund(s) will make distributions of income that vary over time. In the final months of each Underlying Funds' operation, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash-like instruments. As a result, its yield will tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Underlying Fund and lower than prevailing yields in the bond market. The Funds' distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of investment and the Funds do not seek to return any predetermined amount. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of an investor's returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in bonds. If the amount an investor receives as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than the investor's cost basis, the investor may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. Investment in a fund of funds is subject to the risks and expenses of the underlying funds. Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.

Title: Vatican's first annual report on child protection calls for 'rigorous approach to reparations'

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 29 Oct THE VATICAN HAS published its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church. Among the recommendations of the pilot annual report is the “need for a streamlined process for discharge from office when warranted”. It also calls for the Church to “study damages and compensation policies to promote a rigorous approach to reparations, as part of the Church’s commitment to the healing journey of victims and survivors”. “Compensation in the Church is not merely reduced to financial aspects,” said the report, “but embraces a much broader spectrum of actions.” These broader actions include public apologies. The report said it will “delve into the pillar of reparations in the next edition to better represent all these needs”. “Economic reparations are particularly relevant, and the Commission will continue to offer its cooperation to key Church bodies,” said the report. The pilot report also calls for the “professionalisation of safeguarding in the Church, by providing formal academic opportunities and adequate resources for aspiring safeguarding practitioners”. The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors presented its first report this morning. Pope Francis established the Commission, consisting of an independent panel of experts, in December 2014, amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse. In 2022, Pope Francis asked for an annual and “reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change”. Francis added that he wants a “commitment to conversion away from evil and to healing the wounded”. Pope Francis during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's square at the Vatican on 23 October, 2024 The Commission was then incorporated into the Roman Curia, the government of the Holy See which assists the pope in the day-to-day exercise of his role as the leader of the Catholic Church. In April 2022, Pope Francis called for the annual reports to have a particular focus on the care of survivors of abuse. He told the Commission: “I urge you to assist in establishing suitable centres where individuals who have experienced abuse can find acceptance and an attentive hearing, and be accompanied in a process of healing and justice.” The first annual report is described as a “first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting”, and documents “where risks remain, and where advances can be found in the Church’s efforts to protect children and vulnerable adults”. The pilot report was today launched by the commission’s president, US Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors. Advertisement Cardinal O’Malley thanked the media for their presence at the press conference launching the report and said: “We know that the role you have played in forcing the Church to confront our terrible history with abuse has been very, very important.” He acknowledged that survivors are “tired of empty words” and that nothing the Church does “will ever be enough to fully repair what has happened”. “Your suffering and wounds have opened our eyes to the fact that as a Church, we have failed to care for victims, and that we didn’t defend you, and that we resisted understanding you when you needed us most,” said O’Malley. However, O’Malley said the report will help to “ensure that these events never happen again in the Church”. The annual reports will review safeguarding policies and procedures in around 20 Episcopal conferences each year and ensure there are standardised practices in place. This will include ensuring resources are in place for universal standards in safeguarding and to create centres of reporting and assistance for survivors of clerical abuse. While between 15 and 20 Episcopal conferences, representing local churches, will be reviewed each year, it’s hoped that doing so will result in the entire Church being reviewed over a period of five to six annual reports. Each annual report will also include an analysis of select religious institutes, and the pilot report included a review of the Spiritans. The annual report will also explore the Roman Curia’s role in promoting a culture of safeguarding, which is deemed to “uniquely serve as a hub for sharing good practices in safeguarding”. The Commission also aims to create a “higher degree of transparency in the Roman Curia’s procedures and jurisprudence with regard to individual cases of clerical abuse”. The Spiritans were one of the religious institutions analysed in the pilot report. It emerged in late 2022 that following an RTÉ radio documentary that 233 people had made allegations of abuse against 77 Irish Spiritans in ministries throughout Ireland and abroad. Of those, 57 people alleged they were abused on the Blackrock College campus. The leader of the Spiritans in Ireland, Father Martin Kelly, issued an apology in November 2022 to all victims on behalf of the order. The report voiced concern that in some of the more than 60 countries where the Spiritans operate, “the safeguarding officer is designated in name only and does not have any specific ordinary functions in practice”. The Commission also noted “cultural resistance to safeguarding in members’ countries of origin and in contexts where members work, some of whom see safeguarding as an imposed Western ideology”. “This resistance highlights the challenges in bringing safeguarding guidelines to life, in changing the attitudes of the members,” said the report. It also warned that the Spiritans retain “vestiges of a culture of clericalism with some members”. The Commission will engage with the Spiritans in the revision of new guidelines, set for publication this year, “with a particular focus on building a culture of safeguarding”. Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle clerical abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities. In 2019, Pope Francise promised an “all-out battle” against abuse, and compared child sex abuse to human sacrifice. Related Reads Irish woman who resigned from Vatican abuse panel says new report is like 'marking your own homework' But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. Maud de Boer Buquicchio, a Dutch lawyer and former UN special rapporteur on the sexual exploitation of children who chaired the Commission’s report, said last week it would help promote a “change of mindset in the Church that embraces accountability and transparency”. During its compilation, “we have been able to explore many of the concerns about the lack of available data”, she added. File image of Maud de Boer-Buquicchio. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Speaking at today’s launch, de Boer Buquicchio said the call for “accountability and justice has gone unanswered in the Church for too long”. However, she said the first annual report “engages Church membership at the highest levels in acknowledging the urgent need to better answer that call”. She added today that the reports will ensure abuse is rare and thoroughly investigated if it does occur. Members of the abuse commission are directly appointed by the pope and are experts in fields related to safeguarding, from clinical psychology to law as well as human rights. But two members representing abuse survivors resigned in 2017, one of whom was Marie Collins, who was raped by a priest in Ireland when she was 13 years old, Collins had decried as “shameful” the lack of cooperation from Vatican officials. At today’s press conference, a journalist asked Cardinal O’Malley about Collins’s resignation. 2012 file image of Marie Collins Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo O’Malley said “Marie Collins was one of our most beloved and valuable members of the Commission” and that he was “sorry when she decided to step away”. “We understood the reasons and all of us have felt that frustration of the slowness of change coming about, but we believe that the change is taking place, even though it’s often an uphill climb.” He added: “The fact that the commission is being embedded within the Roman Curia, and given a permanent status, will be very helpful to our work.” Last year, influential German Jesuit priest Hans Zollner also quit the Commission, complaining about “structural and practical issues”. Meanwhile, O’Malley was also asked by a journalist if “there is a link between celibacy and child sexual abuse”. O’Malley said he has “never seen any serious study” pointing to such a link and that “we are satisfied that celibacy is not the cause of paedophilia”.

Title: Bitcoin hits $71K – Will Uptober, FOMO fuel a new ATH this week?

Time Published: 2024-10-29T11:30:26Z

Bitcoin could form an ATH before the end of Uptober after the recent rally fueled FOMO. Bitcoin [BTC] has been trending up this month and recently reached a 20-week high above $71,500. At press time, BTC traded at $70,900 and was only 3.7% shy of its all-time highs. Several bullish indicators currently suggest that Bitcoin could form a fresh ATH before the end of “Uptober” amid positive market sentiment. A look at the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price for short-term holders suggests that prices could continue to rise in the short term. Per CryptoQuant, the UTXO Realized Price for wallets that have held BTC for under a month is close to surpassing that of wallets that have held Bitcoin for between three to six months. Past crossovers have often preceded significant price increases. A similar crossover is about to happen, which could strengthen the bullish narrative around BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Short-term holders usually determine the sustainability of a rally. Therefore, if new transactions start occurring at higher prices, it will boost market sentiment and pave the way to an ATH. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 98% of BTC holders are sitting in profits while 1.26% are at a break-even point. Source: IntoTheBlock When wallet profitability increases, it boosts investor confidence as holders become more willing to hold their assets rather than sell. This scenario can also stir the fear of missing out (FOMO). As a result, new buyers could enter the market, reinforcing the uptrend. FOMO is already evident as the Fear and Greed Index sits at 72. This shows that the market is in a state of greed. On 28th October, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their highest inflows in two weeks. Per SoSoValue, inflows during the day came in at $479M, with Blackrock taking the largest share with $315M inflows. Source: SoSoValue As AMBCrypto reported, BlackRock’s BTC holdings have surpassed 400,000 coins, with the asset manager being on track to flipping Satoshi and becoming the largest Bitcoin holder. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $68.47 billion worth of assets, which is 4.9% of Bitcoin’s supply. In just two weeks, these ETFs have recorded $3 billion in netflows. As Bitcoin attracts new interest from both retail and institutional investors, its market dominance over altcoins has continued to soar. At press time, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 60% while the altcoin season index had dropped to 27.

Fink, whose mammoth fund oversees over $10 trillion in assets, sees one rate reduction before the end of this year, compared to the two trims that other market participants have forecast. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said at a panel during Saudi Arabia's annual flagship investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative. "We have government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost.' Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking," he noted. Fink's mention of onshoring highlighted the U.S.'s efforts in recent years — particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic — to reduce dependence on foreign supply chains and to invest in domestic jobs, particularly in manufacturing. The Biden administration's legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, have pushed those efforts forward. Those changes can contribute to increases in the price of goods, as American workers are paid more than those in many offshore manufacturing destinations like China. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting," Fink said. The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September, signaling a turning point in its management of the U.S. economy and in its outlook for inflation. In late-September reports, strategists at J.P. Morgan and Fitch Ratings predicted two additional interest rate cuts by the end of 2024, and expect such reductions to continue into 2025. America's consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, was up 2.4% in September compared to the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is a tick down from the 2.5% print of August, meaning that price growth slowed. The September reading was also the smallest annual one since February 2021. A group of CEOs speaking on a subsequent panel at the event — which included Wall Street hegemons such as the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street — were asked to raise their hand if they thought two additional rate cuts would be implemented by the Fed this year.

Title: Ireland captaincy comes at the right time for Caelan Doris
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/29/ireland-captaincy-comes-at-the-right-time-for-caelan-doris/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Timing is everything, it’s said. If it is meant to happen, it will, at the right point for the right reasons. Before last season’s Six Nations, at the start of this World Cup cycle, it was still a tad too soon to have the Irish captaincy thrust upon Caelan Doris, whereas now feels like the right point, both for him and the team. Although he captained the Blackrock College senior cup team at school in 2015-16 and also the Irish Under-20s at the 2018 Junior World Championships, Doris gave the distinct impression that on progressing into the senior ranks he was happy to stay in the trenches. It was not until New Year’s Day last season that Doris first captained Leinster against Ulster at the RDS, by which stage he was 25 and had played 72 times for the province. Just over a month later Doris led Ireland for the first time too, against Italy in the Six Nations and he wasn’t too proud to admit he had his reservations. “I’m enjoying it a lot more at this stage than when it first came about,” Doris admitted in the wake of captaining Leinster to their 24-6 win over the Lions last Saturday and on foot of being anointed by Andy Farrell as Irish captain last week. “I would have said to you guys in the first couple of weeks, the sort of self-doubt and the bit of ‘impostor syndrome’ and feeling that there’s new responsibilities and getting used to it all. “I’ve had quite a few weeks at it now and things feel a bit more comfortable, and I’m starting to enjoy it more. I’m feeling growth in the role, I’m feeling a bit of my capacity expanding a little bit, but I know there’s still a ton of room for growth. “I’m by no means the leader I want to be yet, the leader I believe I can get to, where I’ve seen the likes of Johnny [Sexton] and Pete [O’Mahony] are at that stage of their careers. It’s an enjoyable journey, I guess, and I’m enjoying the pushing through the comfort zone.” Doris needed cajoling, and the investment in him becoming captaincy material was initiated by Stuart Lancaster and Farrell. “I captained in school and at underage as well but they really pushed it out of me when it wasn’t always the comfortable thing for me, and especially as a young player. I wanted to focus more on me and get the best out of myself and was trying to get a grip on how to be a professional and how to prepare as best as possible for my game. “But while doing that, Stuart Lancaster, from quite a young age when I came into Leinster and with all young players to be fair, he was saying: ‘Find your voice, and if you have a point speak up’ etc. “So, the two of them probably pushed it out of me a little bit and I’m grateful for that now at this stage, definitely.” A run of games as Leinster captain toward the end of last season helped him further acquit himself with the role before, he led Ireland to that wonderful second Test win in Durban. Whereas Doris captained Leinster and Ireland for the first time at the age of 25, and is now 26, by comparison Brian O’Driscoll was 23 when he first captained Ireland to an 18-9 win over Australia at Lansdowne Road in November 2002, and he was 25 when made full-time captain before the 2004 Six Nations. Granted, O’Driscoll did not assume the Leinster captaincy until 2005. There is no written rule about this, and ultimately O’Driscoll relinquished the captaincy of his province in September 2008 at the age of 28. But Doris does not seem too perturbed about the dual responsibility being thrust upon him. “No, I don’t think so. I’m definitely excited by it and I’m looking forward to it. I love being in both environments and we’re looked after very well. I’ve only played three games so far this season so when I’m not playing there are other guys who are leading more that week. It’s not as relentless as it might seem. “Of course, you’re the official captain but there are so many other guys who are capable of leading, and are leading, as well. So, there’s not too much weight on my shoulders.” Akin to O’Driscoll, Doris can also lead by example. “The main message from both talking to the coaches, through the conversation of me being captain, but also when I’ve gone to the likes of Sexto or Pete, or even Garry [Ringrose] and James [Ryan], everyone’s main point is ‘the most important thing is the 80 minutes; your performance, lead through actions’. “I’ve got a pretty good process in how I prepare, and I can’t let up on that while looking after everything else or the added responsibilities. My focus is still trying to prepare myself, while also taking other things into account, but not letting up on that in order to do the others. I’m trying to do that.” A Friday night under lights against the All Blacks adds to his sense of anticipation. “Big time. I love Friday night games. I think it’s conducive to a pretty good atmosphere. I like evening games anyway. I haven’t thought about it too much yet given the start of the season with Leinster but the excitement is definitely going to build.” As to anyone who says these autumnal games are not competitive, but friendlies, he laughs and says: “Just watch the game. “They are by no means friendly encounters. There’s extreme levels of competition, there’s always something on the line. Look at any of the games we’ve played against them over the last number of years. I think there’s mutual respect built. “We’ve obviously always respected them given their legacy in rugby really but I think they’re starting to respect us more over the last five/six years, probably since 2016 really. It’s a good rivalry and I’m looking forward to getting stuck into it.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Dominates $3.4 Billion October Crypto Inflows—What’s Behind the Boom?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-dominates-3-4-billion-october-crypto-inflows-whats-behind-the-boom/

Investment activity in digital assets surged almost throughout October, as crypto investment products, especially that of Bitcoin, experienced substantial inflows, according to the latest data released by CoinShares. Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: Bitcoin spikes to $71,500, 4% away from all-time high

Share this article Bitcoin has rallied over 5% to $71,500 and is now within striking distance of its all-time high of $73,700. The surge comes as the US presidential election is just days away. According to data from CoinGecko, the largest crypto asset by market cap broke the $70,000 price level on Monday after a minor correction last week, mostly driven by the escalating conflict in the Middle East and alleged regulatory scrutiny over Tether. Despite a sudden drop below $66,000, Bitcoin bounced back and consolidated within the $67,000-$68,000 range over the weekend. It ultimately broke out and soared to $70,000 for the first time in over four months. According to seasoned trader Peter Brandt, the post-halving advance may have started and Bitcoin may be entering a bullish phase. “The 5-month inverted expanding triangle has now been completed. Follow through will be important. The post-halving advance may have begun. The series of lower highs and lower lows since March has come to an end,” Brandt said in a recent post on X. As Crypto Briefing previously reported, certain key metrics pointed to a potential upward trend in the price of Bitcoin. The Bollinger Bands, an indicator used to assess price volatility, are at one of their tightest points in history. This “Bollinger Squeeze” often precedes periods of low volatility, which can lead to powerful price breakouts. In addition, the Miner Position Index (MPI), which measures the flow of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges, shows that Bitcoin miners are currently in an accumulation phase, while block rewards are on the rise. The combination of a low MPI and rising block rewards suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoin ETFs remains strong. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3 billion in net inflows in the last two weeks. These ETFs started this week on a high note, collectively drawing around $479 million in net capital with no outflows reported. BlackRock continued its Bitcoin buying spree, logging over $315 million in net buying on Monday. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees reaccelerating Bitcoin ETF inflows among key factors that could propel Bitcoin to six-figure prices, together with the upcoming presidential election, increasing whale accumulation, reduced Bitcoin supply post-halving, and global monetary adjustments. Analysts at Standard Chartered project that Bitcoin could reach approximately $73,000 by Election Day on November 5. Plus, the analysts suggest that if former President Donald Trump wins the election, Bitcoin may surge to around $80,000, with a potential increase of up to $125,000 by the end of the year if Republicans secure control of Congress. Analysts at Bitfinex also anticipate that the US presidential election could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s rally, potentially pushing its price beyond $73,666 due to heightened market activity and volatility surrounding the election. Meanwhile, several other experts believe that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact regardless of the electoral outcome. Steven Lubka, head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin, anticipates that Bitcoin will hit six-figure prices due to its strong correlation with fiscal and monetary conditions rather than political leadership.

Title: FET: a pathway to endless opportunities for students
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2024/10/29/fet-a-pathway-that-provides-opportunities/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T03:15:00Z

It gets less fanfare than the CAO, but further education and training (FET) offers a range of career-focused options for school-leavers – and it would be a mistake not to explore them. Over the past few years, I’ve spoken with countless students who thrived in apprenticeships, post-Leaving Cert (PLC) courses and traineeships. Some were high achievers who fell short of the points needed for their degree programme, and did a year-long PLC in a local college of further education, which opened the door to their CAO course of choice. Others wanted a vocational, work-ready qualification and found it in an apprenticeship, allowing them to earn as they learned. One student got great results in his Leaving Cert, but decided that a year in a PLC would serve as a bridge between school and college. “One in 10 adults in Ireland – around 423,000 people – were engaged in FET courses and apprenticeships last year,” says Maria Walshe, director of branding, communications and FET strategy implementation at Solas. “Fast becoming a prime destination for school-leavers, increasing numbers of students are now choosing the FET route. Last year, for example, course enrolments were up 11 per cent year on year for QQI level five and six courses, also known as PLCs.” Walshe says that not only is FET a smart choice for school-leavers in its own right, but also a pathway that provides opportunities that can take learners directly into careers, as well as offering progression routes to higher education. “For those unsure of their next step after school, FET can provide students with the option to set their own pace and to explore a subject or interest before applying to a four-year degree.” Paige Tomlin, a 19-year-old school-leaver, is doing a PLC course in computer science at Blackrock College of Further Education. “I was one of the fortunate students to be offered computer science as a Leaving Cert subject, and I really enjoyed it,” she says. “I loved the coding aspect and knew that this was an area I would like to work in. But I didn’t do well enough in my Leaving Cert to get the points. In my research, I learned that the PLC could be a gateway for computer science in TU Dublin or DCU, so I went for it. “The course involves five days a week of classes, but it’s not too intense as there are gaps between some of the lectures. It also includes work experience hours, and there’s even an opportunity to go on an eight-day course in Portugal. “There’s coding, maths, web development, databases, spreadsheets and communications – where we have had a chance to work on our CVs – on the course so, although I do want to go to college, there are also opportunities for us to go straight into the workforce.” Unlike third level, the fees are minimal, and this year Tomlin only had to pay a €50 registration fee. (It should be noted that some PLCs, particularly in art and design, may require students to buy equipment or supplies, and so can end up costing more). Tomlin says that she has really enjoyed the course. “We’ve done collaborative work in group projects, and we’ve worked solo. I’ve made friends on the course and am really glad I took it on.” The possibilities are endless with FET, says Walshe. “They take students into a diverse range of exciting careers, through courses in areas as diverse as commis chef, animal care, games production, cyber security, personal training and applied science. “The beauty of FET is that it is for everyone. Available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) across the country, FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home. FET courses are available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 education and training boards (ETBs) across the country. “FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home,” says Walshe. “There are many opportunities for students to discover FET courses on offer in their local community, as well as pathways from FET to university. Open days are run by FET colleges on an ongoing basis and are definitely worth checking out.” Your regular guide to the latest education news, analysis and opinion, as well as classroom resources, posters and lots more © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
