I’ve been banging on about the lack of proper French restaurants in Dublin for years. Loudly. And, until recently, to absolutely no avail. If dining trends are cyclical, the 2015 closure of Racine in London – where I once dined on Henry Harris’s famed tête de veau with sauce ravigote, minus the calf’s brain (something to do with supply, I was told, though it didn’t stop the obvious jokes) – marked the end of bourgeois cooking and the dominance of new Nordic cuisine and its small plates. Now, London has gone full bouchon (Lyonnaise style restaurant). Harris is back, rattling pans at Bouchon Racine (good luck getting a booking), and bouchon-inspired spots are springing up faster than champignons after a downpour: Josephine Bouchon, Henri, Café Francois, Marceline – proof, if it were needed, that the Gallic revival is in full swing. And Dublin? Rien du tout. Until now. John and Sandy Wyer got wind that the space above O’Brien’s pub, conveniently next door to their fine dining spot, Forest Avenue, on Sussex Terrace, had become available. Formerly The Sussex, the room came pre-loaded with bistro charm: Victorian flourishes, casual wooden tables, and banquettes you can sink into. A few tweaks later, et voilà – a proper bistro, at last. They’ve named it Forêt, staying true to their woodland theme (see also: Little Forest in Blackrock). The menu is a celebration of French cooking at its most confident. Petites Assiettes (snacks) include house-made saucisson, leek vinaigrette, Bayonne ham and oysters mignonette (€3 each), a bright and briny opener. From the tempting Les Entrées, comes the terrine de campagne (€16). This rustic staple, straight from the bouchon playbook, is robust, slightly coarse, and made with Oxford Sandy and Black suckling pig from Dermot Allen’s Winetavern Farm in Wicklow. It’s crowned with an amber gelée, lightly laced with sherry (if I’m not mistaken), delivering a rich, savoury depth when spread onto the toasted sourdough. The violet mustard on the side is sharp enough to jolt you awake, while the cornichons add just the right tangy crunch to balance the richness. For our other starter, a salad of green beans (€12) mingles with rocket, lettuce, hazelnuts and potato in a velvety dressing that pools on the plate, topped with grated mimolette, the nutty Edam-style cheese from Lille. It’s simple but beautifully executed. [ Ballyfin restaurant review: ‘Downright dazzling, one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year’Opens in new window ] The French wine list is a salute to tradition, carefully chosen without falling into populist clichés and favouring low volume producers. There are eight wines by the glass (which are also available as half bottles), and the Forest Avenue house wine, a very good Burgundian Chardonnay (€48), carries us happily through the meal. The fish, halibut Grenobloise with artichoke purée (€28), is stunning. The skin is gloriously crisp, and the pearlescent flakes of fish are so perfectly cooked they practically glow. Capers and chives bring a bright, salty punch, while pickled celery adds crunch and a vinegary bite. A creamy, lemon-spiked sauce ties everything together, while the artichoke purée sits quietly on the side, offering an earthy counterpoint to the fish, fondant potato and sauce. It’s the dish of the evening, without question. Across the table, my daughter Belle has the chicken au vin jaune (€26) which is also very tasty. The bronzed, crackling skin hides succulent free-range breast meat, while the sauce – enriched with Jura’s famed Savagnin wine, aged under flor for six years – delivers nutty, rounded depth. It’s paired with kale, finely chopped morel mushrooms, and riz à la paysanne: buttery rice laced with tarragon and dotted with tender nuggets of chicken. Desserts walk the line between indulgence and restraint. The crème brûlée is tempting, but there’s only room to share, so croissant pudding (€8) it is. Croissants from the Wyers’ Una Bakery are transformed into a luxurious bread-and-butter pudding: crispy on top, custardy in the middle, and swimming in Cointreau caramel and custard. The vanilla ice-cream, with an intriguing touch of buckwheat, is bold yet balanced. [ Parrilla restaurant review: With happy diners and cocktail shaker at full throttle, Tuesday is the new Friday at this new Mexican spotOpens in new window ] Forêt is a masterclass in why the classics endure. Why butter, cream and meticulously sourced produce remain the holy trinity of good taste – and why a perfect croissant is never just a croissant. It’s a love letter to the French bistro, where every dish is cooked with precision, seasoned with authority, and served with an unwavering respect for tradition. The attention to detail goes beyond the plate, from the well-considered wine list to the understated ambiance, making it more than just a meal. It’s an experience. And with prices so thoughtfully pitched, it’s poised to become a firm favourite. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and water was €148. The Verdict: It’s Lyonnaise bouchon in spirit and pure joy on the plate. Food provenance: Glenmar, Kingsbury Wagyu, Winetavern Farm, McNally Farm, and Castleruddery Farm. Vegetarian options: Leek vinaigrette, egg mayonnaise with celeriac rémoulade, onion velouté, green bean salad and vegetarian pithivier for main course. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: French classics, from Georges Brassen to Gillian Hills.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach $95,000 For The First Time In History

Bitcoin broke through $95,000 this evening. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin prices attained their latest all-time high this evening when they climbed to $95,000 for the first time ever. The world’s most prominent digital currency, which has been enjoying some very compelling upside in recent weeks, rose to $95,000.20, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. The cryptocurrency has notched a series of fresh records recently as it benefits from very strong momentum and a wide range of bullish factors. Several analysts commented on the digital asset’s strength as of late, as well as developments that have helped fuel its aggressive gains. “It seems that almost every day Bitcoin makes a new all time high!” the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O said via emailed comments. “There are rumors circulating that Bitcoins latest push could be due to 1) Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1 billion inflows in 48 hours with ARKS ARKB leading the way with $267.3 million in inflows and 2)BlackRock Bitcoin ETF options launching with $1.9 Billion dollars traded on it’s first day!” she stated in reference to today’s upward movement. The market observer emphasized the strong inflows enjoyed by bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the significant interest in options contracts based on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT. Interestingly enough, the total bitcoin held by U.S. bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed 1 million units, according to figures that CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno supplied via Telegram chat. The chart below illustrates this milestone: U.S. bitcoin ETFs' total bitcoin holdings recently passed 1 million units. One analyst emphasized how intense demand for bitcoin is right now as the digital currency benefits from a very compelling combination of bullish factors. “Bitcoin’s climb to $95,000 feels like humanity finally boarding a lifeboat while the legacy financial system’s Titanic takes on water,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Persistent inflation, fiat instability, and a lack of trust in central banks are driving both individuals and institutions toward Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value,” he added. “Today’s surge likely stems from a perfect storm: rising demand, a supply crunch, and unwavering conviction from long-term holders.” One market observer spoke to just how bright bitcoin’s future seems to be. George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, spoke to the digital currency’s current situation, emphasizing that “Typically you have at least some reasonable Bull and Bear case on anything.” “For example we have followed COIN through BTC to profit heavily off the ‘Trump trade’ the other stock we targeted before the election was Tesla,” he noted. “We said it would move around full self driving and sure enough it did around positive news this week. But you see things like this questioning the viability of FSD.” “There is some Bear case that is being made,” stressed Kailas. “I don't see a Bear case over the next 4 years right now for BTC so that is invariably going to create an environment where more and more major players jump on that bandwagon because it is glaring them in the face.” Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $95,000 for first time on optimism over Trump crypto plans

By Tom Westbrook, Samuel Indyk and Suzanne McGee SINGAPORE/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bitcoin came within a whisker of closing above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading between $98,000 and $99,000 in late afternoon trading in the U.S. on Thursday, after briefly touching $99,073. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Over 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. "Everyone who’s bought bitcoin at any point in history is currently in profit," Alicia Kao, managing director of crypto exchange KuCoin, said. "But those who bought it early, when there were significant obstacles to doing so and there was the might of the world’s financial and governmental forces intent on crushing it, are the real winners. Not because they’re rich, but because they’re right.” Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. CRYPTO RUSH More than $4 billion has streamed into U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election. This week, there was a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF, with call options - bets on the price going up - more popular than puts. "There is a persistent bid in the market," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a digital assets hedge fund in Miami. "$100,000 is a foregone conclusion." Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 2.3% on Thursday. “Once you break out to new highs, you attract a lot of new capital," John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, said. "It's like gold in the 1970s, where this new high is in a price discovery mode. You don't know how high it's going to go," he said. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticized for its energy usage, with miners under scrutiny over their potential impact on power grids and greenhouse gas emissions due to their energy-intensive operations. Crypto crime also remains a concern, with an analysis by crypto researchers Chainalysis finding that at least $24.2 billion worth of crypto was sent to illicit wallet addresses last year, including addresses identified as sanctioned or linked to terrorist financing and scams.

Title: Bitcoin Gains VanEck’s Official Support As Strategic Reserve

Time Published: 2024-11-21T01:00:13Z

The firstborn cryptocurrency has found another ally in the traditional financial sector after a respected global investment company affirmed its support for making Bitcoin a strategic reserve. The backing of VanEck, a respected name in the investment sector, in Bitcoin shows the coin’s growing appeal even to traditional financial players, a remarkable milestone that could benefit the whole crypto space. Well-known asset manager VanEck announced that it is throwing its support to Bitcoin, saying that it will advocate for the plan of US President-elect Donald Trump to turn the crypto into a national strategic reserve. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, made the official announcement of the investment firm’s stance on the idea, committing himself to champion Trump’s proposal. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: VanEck Endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. No need for ‘sources’—we’ll just tell you ourselves. https://t.co/ZO28dqiBqC — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 19, 2024 VanEck will join fellow international asset manager BlackRock in the growing supporters of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, another positive development on the intensifying discussion of the role of digital assets in American economic policy. It can be recalled that in 2017, the global asset management company was the pioneer in pushing for a future-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country. As of writing, VanEck holds over 13,000 BTC with an estimated value of over $1.2 billion. In a campaign last July, Trump unveiled his vision of making the US the most successful nation in the cryptocurrency sector, announcing his plan to establish a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile” in the country. Trump said that he plans to make it a policy to keep all of the Bitcoin the US government “currently holds or acquires into the future”, adding that this BTC stockpile will become the core of the strategic national crypto reserve. During his campaign, Trump promised cryptocurrency players and investors that he would champion the sector and advocate for its deregulation. The entire crypto space is now counting on the incoming President to deliver on this commitment during his administration. Earlier this week, Satoshi Action Fund (SAF) co-founder and CEO Dennis Porter confirmed that premier asset manager BlackRock will back the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Porter believes that Trump’s government would push for the crafting of an executive order that would establish the BTC reserve, providing an optimistic outlook on the future of the alpha crypto. He added that the first step to making this reserve a reality is appointing a “pro-Bitcoin Treasury Secretary” who can initiate the creation of the strategic reserve. Moreover, Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced proposed legislation that would be key to the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Lummis urged the US Congress to pass the Boost Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. If Lummis’ bill is enacted, all the Bitcoin owned by the American government is to be preserved and not sold. Current estimates showed that the US government holds 69,370 BTC with a value of $6.4 billion. Featured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Emerging AI Stocks You Should Keep on Your Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:KC) stands against the other AI stocks you should keep on your radar. As reported by CNBC on November 13, OpenAI’s "blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure" outlines plans for AI economic zones, utilizing the U.S. Navy's nuclear expertise, and attracting private investment in government projects. The proposal includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China and a National Transmission Highway Act to modernize the grid. OpenAI views AI as a transformative technology, driving job creation, economic growth, and advancements in energy and chip manufacturing. The blueprint recommends speeding up permitting processes and creating research hubs at public universities. It also calls for expanding energy and fiber connectivity with government-backed funding. OpenAI highlights the Midwest and Southwest as ideal areas for AI development, with a focus on renewable energy and data centers. The plan emphasizes the need for 50 gigawatts of energy by 2030 to support AI growth and proposes small modular reactors to expand nuclear power capacity.

CNBC recently discussed the future of AI with Kunle Olukotun, co-founder and chief technologist at SambaNova Systems. The discussion centered on the growing demand for AI in 2025, with major tech companies continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure. While these companies are shifting from AI experimentation to deployment, there’s a significant focus on the transition from training models to using them in real-world applications. This change is leading to more complex AI systems, which integrate multiple models for business automation. Kunle Olukotun expects that in 2025, businesses will move beyond pilot phases, widely adopting AI systems that involve more complex reasoning and interactions, rather than simple chatbots. The key to this shift will be rapid inference capabilities.

Title: Is Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) the Best Fertilizer Stock to Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sociedad-qu-mica-y-minera-233331270.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) stands against the other fertilizer stocks. The fertilizer industry is a crucial sector in agriculture that focuses on the production and distribution of substances that enhance plant growth. By supplying necessary nutrients, fertilizers help improve crop yields and quality, which are essential for feeding the growing global population. The industry has evolved significantly over time, with modern practices relying heavily on chemically manufactured fertilizers to support large-scale farming and meet the global demand for food. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market is estimated to have reached a value of $381.7 billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.99% during 2024-2030 to reach $541.2 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Right Now. There is a strong sense of optimism within the industry. The Fertilizer Institute’s 2023 Industry Trends Survey highlighted a positive outlook within the fertilizer sector, with many respondents expressing confidence in future growth. About 40% of those surveyed believe that market conditions have improved over the past five years, despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Companies attribute their resilience to strategic practices such as precommitment purchases and careful planning. Nearly 80% of participants are optimistic about their businesses being equally or more profitable in the next five years. The fertilizer industry is currently experiencing several key trends that are shaping its future. Advances in technology are transforming how fertilizers are produced and applied. Innovations such as precision agriculture, which uses data analytics and sensors, help farmers optimize fertilizer usage based on specific soil conditions and crop needs. Additionally, there is a growing demand for fertilizers that offer more nutrients while reducing their environmental impact. The emphasis on maximizing the efficiency of fertilizer application to promote sustainable farming practices is increasing, which is driving the development of new and innovative solutions. On August 13, CNBC reported that Windfall Bio, a California-based startup, is addressing methane emissions using "mems," or methane-eating microbes. These microbes naturally consume methane and convert it into fertilizer. This innovative approach helps reduce harmful methane from sources like agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Farmers can use the fertilizer produced, while companies generating waste methane can sell it back to Windfall, creating a new revenue stream. These trends indicate a dynamic shift in the fertilizer industry, balancing the need for increased food production with environmental sustainability and innovation. Methodology To compile our list of the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest fertilizer companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best fertilizer stocks. We carefully verified our list to remove any companies that can not be classified as fertilizer stocks. From an initial pool of over 15 fertilizer stocks, we focused on the stocks that analysts believe possess the greatest potential for growth. Finally, we ranked the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now based on their average price target upside potential according to analysts, as of November 18, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory technician pouring a specialty blend of industrial chemicals into a beaker. Average Upside Potential According to Analysts: 34.23% Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean company that offers a variety of products for different industries, including agriculture, health, nutrition, and renewable energy. The company is well-known for its fertilizers, particularly potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate, which are essential for enhancing crop yields. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) also produces lithium and iodine. In the first half of 2024, SQM reported revenues of $2.37 billion, a decrease from $4.31 billion in the same quarter last year. Despite this drop, the company experienced strong sales growth in its lithium, iodine, and fertilizer segments, with fertilizer demand increasing by over 20% compared to last year. Although Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.’s (NYSE:SQM) performance in its recent quarter was less than ideal, it has demonstrated resilience with a compound annual growth rate of 10% in revenue over the past decade. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy now. Analysts are optimistic about SQM’s future. The 12-month median price target for the stock set by analysts indicates a potential upside of 34% from the current stock price. With ongoing demand for both lithium and fertilizers expected to rise, Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) presents a compelling investment opportunity. Overall SQM ranks 2nd on our list of the best fertilizer stocks to buy.

Abstract graphics processing unit (GPU) - a part of the AI value chain. Artificial Intelligence has been reshaping our world at breakneck speed, with ChatGPT hitting 100 million users in just two months and Nvidia hitting revenue of $32.8 billion solely in the third quarter of 2024. AI is no longer a sci-fi concept but a business necessity and an integral part of our economy. Yet despite this explosive growth, participating in the economic layer of AI remains challenging for many. Here's where AI Finance stands a chance to change the rules of the game. AiFi is a new financial framework bridging the AI economy with decentralized finance, that democratizes access to AI-related assets such as GPUs or data, creating new value streams. At the same time, it’s powering DeFi with agents and AI-enhanced applications. Over the years, the decentralized finance community has built the foundations that made it possible for AiFi to emerge. The way DeFi and its primitives - like onchain lending - evolved enabled the industry to have an adaptable infrastructure for all kinds of assets, both crypto-native and not. Tokenization, as a process of bringing off-chain assets onto the blockchain, paved a way for non-crypto assets to boom back in 2023. Tokenized real-world assets, especially money market funds, exemplify how the integration of non-crypto assets has found a product market fit in an onchain economy. The biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, has dominated the crypto market at a 22% market share with its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL token, marking yet another milestone for RWA adoption within TradFi. Using DeFi infrastructure for tokenized assets has already made waves, passing over 10 billion TVL. But it’s only the beginning. The numbers tell a compelling story. With the global artificial intelligence industry revenue expected to be around $1.8 trillion by 2030, the AI economy stands as a strategic sector for tokenization. However, staggering projections often mask significant barriers to entry. Substantial capital investment and technical expertise are required to participate in the AI market, leaving smaller organizations on the sidelines with a lack of resources for funding further expansion. In addition, the nascent stage of this technology and the lack of global AI markets lead to limited access for various user segments, particularly retail, and hinder the potential revenue growth of AI companies. This is where blockchain technology and tokenization enter the picture. By bringing AI-related assets onchain, AiFi creates liquid markets for previously illiquid or inaccessible resources: Blockchain-based tokenization is the key to making assets tradeable, programmable, or composable - features impossible within traditional finance. The blockchain itself should be viewed as financial rails for these new markets, enabling: Numbers don't lie. The growth of AI has created an unprecedented opportunity for many to participate in. Estimations show a bullish perspective for various elements of the AI value chain, with the example of data centers where their demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 15% between now and 2030. These metrics paint a picture of a sector that will display competitive revenue streams. With that, AiFi, as a new framework aims to financialize the AI economy by bringing it onchain for individuals to get exposure to it. And on the other hand, for SMEs and organizations to monetize their datasets and models, or have an alternative way to fundraise capital for expansion. Creating new AiFi-oriented markets makes both AI developers and investors participate in the tokenized AI economy. And now that the vision of Agentic Web has already taken root in Web3, the AiFi narrative gains even more credibility. Where Is AiFi Heading AI-Fi is a blend of two powerful technologies, with AI posing as an overpowering industry and blockchain serving as its financial layer. Tokenization makes it possible for real-world yield via high-quality cash flows into the DeFi ecosystem. It also makes monetizing AI services, such as machine learning models transparent and programmable. Even though the AiFi paradigm of making the AI economy more accessible is at an early stage, it leverages already established DeFi infrastructure and best RWA tokenization practices, all while addressing the AI sector's barriers.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 8 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) stands against Jim Cramer's other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his insights on several key topics. He discussed the recent turmoil in the pharmaceutical sector, which followed the news that President-elect Trump is considering Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. Cramer pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry took a significant hit after the announcement, but he believes this may present solid buying opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that RFK Jr., whom he humorously referred to as "Bobby Jr. for some Sopranos flavor," has a strong anti-big pharma stance, which could be a concern for the sector. However, Cramer emphasized: “... There's a whole federal bureaucracy at HHS and frankly, I don't think Trump will let him wreck a pretty important sector of the stock market.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Is Focused on These 15 Stocks This Week and Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently Cramer further addressed the potential confirmation of RFK Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He suggested that while there is a debate about whether the Senate will provide confirmation for him, he believes RFK Jr. will likely be approved. However, Cramer remained less concerned about RFK Jr. causing significant damage to the pharmaceutical industry, noting that he doesn't expect him to have much success in pushing his anti-vaccine or anti-pharma agenda. Moving on to broader market trends, Cramer commented: “After the initial Trump rally euphoria in the wake of the election, we quickly transitioned to a Trump rally hangover last week with the averages getting clobbered.” He highlighted that semiconductor stocks were among the hardest hit, partially due to the typical tech sector sell-off when bond yields rise, as they did last week. Cramer also expressed concern, saying: “With the election results from earlier this month and the second Trump administration coming in about two months, I am very worried about companies that are hostage to the Chinese economy.” Finally, Cramer turned his attention to autonomous vehicles, suggesting that while the Trump administration’s plans for self-driving cars may sound ambitious, they could be more difficult to execute in practice. He pointed out that a variety of state and local governments would need to align on new regulations, and the notion that the federal government could allow self-driving cars nationwide with a simple executive order seemed "just plain fanciful." Despite this, Cramer advocated for owning TSLA, not because of any regulatory changes under Trump, but because he believes in the vision and leadership of the company’s CEO, Elon Musk. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 18 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of the reactor core, highlighting the complexity of the uranium power process. Cramer mentioned that Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is expensive and said: “Look, all the uranium players are up. I think that they're going to amount to very little in the end. This is not an expensive stock. I understand why you want to be in it, not versus the others, but it is an incredibly expensive stock versus the rest of the market. That's what I care about. I am a kaching kaching when it comes to Cameco.” Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) supplies uranium for electricity generation and offers nuclear fuel processing, reactor technology, and related services to commercial utilities and government agencies worldwide. As per CNBC, on November 20, according to Goldman Sachs, the company is well-positioned for growth, particularly in light of the increasing demand for nuclear power in the United States. The company is expected to benefit from uranium prices, which are projected to rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target for the stock to $64 per share, highlighting the company's potential as uranium prices climb. The stock has risen by approximately 33% so far this year. Analyst Neil Mehta highlighted the company’s integrated business model across the nuclear fuel cycle, emphasizing its strengths in uranium mining, conversion, fabrication, and nuclear services through its stake in Westinghouse. Mehta also noted that Cameco is an appealing partner for Western utilities due to its limited geopolitical risks, with operations primarily based in Canada and the U.S., alongside a single site in Kazakhstan. According to the firm, Cameco’s (NYSE:CCJ) contracts are supported by favorable uranium pricing, with current contracts seeing prices ranging from $70 to $130 per pound, with the midpoint around $100, which is higher than the current spot price of approximately $80 per pound. Additionally, Cameco’s 49% stake in Westinghouse, which is poised to play a key role in the construction of new power plants with its AP1000 reactor, presents further growth potential, as noted by Goldman Sachs. Overall CCJ ranks 6th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CCJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CCJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘I Would Wait For A Dip Because The Bears Are All Over It, Every Minute Of The Day’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 8 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his insights on several key topics. He discussed the recent turmoil in the pharmaceutical sector, which followed the news that President-elect Trump is considering Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. Cramer pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry took a significant hit after the announcement, but he believes this may present solid buying opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that RFK Jr., whom he humorously referred to as "Bobby Jr. for some Sopranos flavor," has a strong anti-big pharma stance, which could be a concern for the sector. However, Cramer emphasized: “... There's a whole federal bureaucracy at HHS and frankly, I don't think Trump will let him wreck a pretty important sector of the stock market.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Is Focused on These 15 Stocks This Week and Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently Cramer further addressed the potential confirmation of RFK Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Cramer reiterated his “own it, don’t trade it” philosophy for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) but also pointed out that the bears are out to get it these days. “Apple, own it don't trade it. If I had no stock, would I buy it right here? I would wait for a dip because the bears are all over it, every minute of the day. Keep that in mind and then pull the trigger.” Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a dominant force in the smartphone market, recent years have presented challenges for the company. On November 15, according to TipRanks, Jefferies pointed out that the company was granted an exemption from import tariffs during the final years of the Trump administration, and since then, the company has actively worked to diversify its production outside of China. However, currently, only around 10% of iPhone production occurs outside China. While it is possible that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could receive another exemption, Jefferies' analysis suggests that without it, gross margins could face a potential decline of 3% to 6.7%, and the company's value could drop by roughly 5% to 10%, assuming no changes in average selling price or volume. Jefferies has maintained a Hold rating on the company stock. It ought to be noted that the company is always at the forefront of innovation. Its incorporation of advanced AI tools into its flagship devices (and others) comes at a time when there is growing enthusiasm around the potential of this technology. The company is only beginning its journey in this area as CEO Tim Cook remarked that it is “just the start of what we believe generative AI can achieve” during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Overall AAPL ranks 8th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE: BLK), today announced the estimated 2024 annual reinvested capital gains distributions for the iShares ETFs listed on the TSX or Cboe Canada.Please note that these are estimated capital gains amounts only, as of October 31, 2024. As these are estimated amounts, the final capital gains distributions may change by the Funds' December 15, 2024 or December 31, 2024, in the case of iShares Premium Money Market ETF (“CMR”), tax year-ends. These estimates are for the annual non-cash capital gains distributions, which are typically reinvested in additional units of the respective funds at the year-end, and do not include estimates of ongoing periodic (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual) cash distribution amounts. The additional units will be immediately consolidated with the previously outstanding units such that the number of outstanding units following the distribution will equal the number of units outstanding prior to the distribution. We expect to announce the final annual reinvested distribution amounts, as well as the ongoing cash distribution amounts, as applicable, for 2024, on or about December 27, 2024. The record date for the 2024 annual distributions will be December 30, 2024, payable on January 3, 2025.

By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual distributions to differ materially from the estimated distributions set forth in this notice. Factors that could cause the actual distributions to differ from the estimated distributions between now and December 15, 2024 (the iShares ETFs’ tax year end) or December 31, 2024 in the case of CMR, include, but are not limited to: the actual amounts of distributions received by the iShares ETFs; the actual amounts of capital gains generated from sales of securities; trading activity within the iShares ETFs, including buying and selling of securities; index changes which cause rebalancing within the iShares ETFs; and subscription and redemption activity.

Title: ‘Bud Light 2.0:’ Jaguar Blasted for Ad Featuring Crossdressers but Not Cars

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/20/2024 12:23:51 PM PST by Morgana Jaguar is being blasted on social media for its ultra-woke commercial featuring androgynous models and not even a single car, with conservatives dubbing the ad “Bud Light 2.0.” The Jaguar commercial, which was posted to the car company’s social media on Tuesday, showed only androgynous individuals clad in bizarre attire that would hardly fit in at a fashion show. The advertisement also failed to showcase even one single vehicle from the luxury car company. The Jaguar ad also featured what appears to be a man wearing a dress, and included messaging that read, “create exuberant,” “live vivid,” “delete ordinary,” and “break moulds.” One social media user reacted to the commercial, declaring, “10 [years] ago: Jags are badass muscle cars for villains. Today: Yass queen gay race communism.” “This is so the wrong timing for this. I can understand the C-suite being conned into this in 2022, but they have completely misread the moment. Bud Light 2.0,” columnist Jon Gabriel wrote. Gabriel was likely referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory — that included winning the popular vote — in the 2024 election, which many took as a message from the American people that the era of “wokeness” needs to end. “This is the new head of brand strategy at Jaguar. Not looking good for them at all,” another X user remarked. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

The advertisement also failed to showcase even one single vehicle from the luxury car company. The Jaguar ad also featured what appears to be a man wearing a dress, and included messaging that read, “create exuberant,” “live vivid,” “delete ordinary,” and “break moulds.” One social media user reacted to the commercial, declaring, “10 [years] ago: Jags are badass muscle cars for villains.

Title: Will Microsoft Buy Bitcoin After Michael Saylor’s 3-Minute BTC Strategy Pitch To Board?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/will-microsoft-buy-bitcoin-after-michael-saylors-3-minute-btc-strategy-pitch-to-board/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T17:32:22Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin uber-bull and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor revealed that he agreed to present a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors, advocating for the premier crypto as a treasury asset. Saylor sees a potential Microsoft Bitcoin investment as a game-changer for the tech giant, especially as Bitcoin inches closer to the highly coveted $100,000 zone. Speaking during a Tuesday X space discussion hosted by crypto ETF provider VanEck, Michael Saylor said he will be delivering a brief, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board. Saylor’s pitch comes amid a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to evaluate the potential impact of a Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation— that’s all you’re allowed — and I’m going to present it to the board of directors,” Saylor said. The MicroStrategy founder, who is a devout Bitcoin evangelist, slammed companies with huge cash reserves for “burning shareholder value”, during yesterday’s discussion. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder with 331,200 BTC (worth $31 billion based on today’s price), believes Bitcoin is a vital asset for corporations with huge hordes of cash. According to him, the benchmark crypto can add significant stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he explained. Saylor has publicly urged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He thinks it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Meanwhile, Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on Dec. 10 on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment. Some prominent shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal, stating that they already assessed a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. As of publication time, Bitcoin had traded for $94,218, reflecting a 1.8 percent gain on the day. Its market cap stood at $1.86 trillion.

Title: DeFi’s Renaissance

Election 2024 coverage presented by The repercussions of historically stringent cryptocurrency oversight are well-documented, but the ensuing sea change is perhaps not fully appreciated. With pro-crypto legislators likely to replace the current regulatory regime, we anticipate a more favorable environment for crypto applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi), in particular, is well-positioned to reap these benefits. From opening the door for traditional finance (TradFi) to partake in DeFi, to enabling fee switches and U.S. user access to protocols, it’s hard to overstate the impacts for DeFi and stablecoins that can come with regulatory clarity. With DeFi TVL up 31% and the stablecoin market cap up 4% since the election, it’s clear that users share this sentiment. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Historically, institutions have hesitated to move on-chain due to regulatory risks. However, with bitcoin ETF AUM inflows on track to surpass the gold ETFs’ AUM within a year, finance and tech companies exploring the technology and offering crypto products, and corporates adding digital assets to their balance sheets, institutional interest in crypto has never been higher. That said, the coexistence of off-chain and on-chain capital thus far has mainly involved using on-chain capital to capture off-chain yield (e.g., Tether purchasing billions of dollars in U.S. treasuries). With regulatory clarity, we are now in the early stages of off-chain capital moving on-chain. Post-election developments, like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton expanding their tokenized money funds to new chains, exemplify the substantial capital ready to enter DeFi and are likely just the tip of the iceberg. And beyond tokenization, Stripe recently acquired stablecoin startup Bridge, McDonald’s partnered with NFT project Doodles, and PayPal is using Ethereum and Solana to settle contracts. This streamlines asset management, enhances market efficiency and liquidity, improves financial inclusion, and ultimately accelerates economic growth. Regulatory clarity will add an accelerant to this already-burgeoning activity. Similarly, DeFi projects like Ethena and Blur are starting to adapt to the evolving environment as they anticipate improvements in regulatory clarity. A frequent criticism of altcoins is their lack of inherent utility. Addressing this, Ethena approved a proposal to allocate a portion of protocol revenue ($132 million annualized) to sENA holders, bridging the gap between revenue generation and token holders. Once executed, the proposal could increase participation and investment in Ethena by directly rewarding token holders, thus setting a potential precedent for revenue sharing in DeFi. This move might also encourage other protocols to consider similar mechanisms, enhancing the appeal of holding DeFi tokens. In addition, protocols may also enable US users to access front-ends and partake in airdrops, compared to the current default of restricting US users. At the same time, development and innovation should flourish, with founders more confident about the reduced risks of building in the U.S. By expanding token utility to benefit from protocol success, enabling access to fair and free on-chain services often without rent-seeking intermediaries, and removing barriers to innovation that have made this country so great, we may be on the brink of a new era for DeFi development and usage. Collectively, these factors indicate that DeFi may be on the brink of a new growth phase, potentially expanding beyond its crypto-native user base to interact more directly with broader financial systems. The DeFi renaissance is here. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin reserve draws mixed reactions: ‘The market is skeptical on…’

BTC hasn’t priced in the potential U.S. BTC reserve, according to Blockstream’s Adam Back. The crypto market is watching two key updates from Trump’s transition team: the treasury secretary pick and the creation of a national Bitcoin [BTC] reserve. The latter has been deemed a significant price driver for BTC, yet it has elicited mixed views from top asset managers in the sector. According to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Mathew Siggel, the firm fully supports the proposal. Siggel stated, “VanEck endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” There have been mixed reports from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Earlier in the week, reports suggested that the firm supported the Bitcoin reserve proposal. However, Fox Business’s Eleanor Terret discredited the earlier reports, citing people close sources close to BlackRock. She said, “Sources close to BlackRock tell FoxBusiness the big money manager is not endorsing a strategic $BTC reserve despite recent reports that it is.” That said, long-time BTC critic Peter Schiff recently claimed that the proposal could affect the U.S. dollar and BTC itself if approved. Part of Schiff’s reaction read, “Ultimately, so many dollars would be printed to buy Bitcoin that the U.S. would experience hyperinflation, rendering the dollar completely worthless. Once the dollar is worthless, the U.S. could no longer keep buying Bitcoin.” However, Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the BTC reserve proponents, championed selling U.S. gold reserves for Bitcoin. The mixed views have made it difficult to gauge whether Trump will eventually create the BTC reserve. In fact, as of press time, Polymarket’s odds of President-elect Trump forming the reserve were below 40%. Source: Polymarket This could mean that a potential reserve wasn’t priced in, according to Blockstream’s Adam Back. Back projected that BTC could hit seven figures (+$1M) if players begin front-running the U.S. reserve. He said, “If the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve happens prepare for 7-figure bitcoin this cycle. The market is skeptical on meaningful follow-through for now, so that is not at all priced in.” That said, the next few days/weeks could offer more insight into whether President Trump will proceed with the proposal.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Options Redefine Crypto Markets with $2B Launch

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. QUICK HITS If you’re looking for an explanation for crypto’s astounding growth, look at these two factors: That second point was on full display over the past day, as a leading Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provider – Blackrock – saw a record-breaking $2B trading volume with the launch of options trading on its ETFs. Now, other providers are hurrying to get in on the action. All that institutional support helped push $BTC to a new all-time high of $93.8K. Let’s see exactly what happened and why it’s such a big deal. The cryptocurrency market witnessed a transformative shift with the introduction of options trading for Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC approved options back in September for several providers. Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the first to launch options trading on Tuesday. It didn’t take long for the money to start flowing in – big time. On the very first day, the market saw an impressive $2B in trading volume, reflecting strong investor enthusiasm. The dominance of call options highlighted bullish sentiment, with many traders speculating on Bitcoin’s potential for significant price appreciation. Options on ETFs open new avenues for investors, heralding a significant moment in the evolution of Bitcoin’s market structure. Hot on the heels of BlackRock’s success, Grayscale announced plans to launch options for its Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale’s options were approved back in September, but BlackRock launched first. If Grayscale had any qualms about offering options, $1.9B and 289K call options probably went a long way toward settling them. By joining the options race, Grayscale aims to maintain competitiveness and capitalize on the burgeoning interest in Bitcoin ETF options. And as one of the largest players in the crypto investment space, Grayscale’s entry is set to further energize the ETF market. Going back to the top – Trump’s support for crypto, including a proposed new SEC chair, has set the stage for renewed investor confidence. Support for Trump’s $BTC reserve appears to be growing, and major companies like Microsoft seem open to the idea of their own $BTC holdings. And all along, professional traders and financial institutions continue to embrace the new trading instruments, using IBIT options to bet on dramatic price increases and leverage new ways of earning income from $BTC. Some are even targeting valuations as high as $100 for the ETF. Beyond speculation, the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options is expected to bring more liquidity to the market, offering new tools for hedging and investment strategies. The arrival of options trading for Bitcoin ETFs signifies a pivotal development for the cryptocurrency market. It reflects growing institutional adoption and provides a platform for sophisticated investment strategies. With major players like BlackRock and Grayscale driving innovation, the market dynamics of Bitcoin are poised for profound transformation. All eyes remain on how these financial products shape the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Options Surge: December 20 Call Signals BTC Price Target Of $180,000

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially launched options trading for its Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This debut comes after the ETF received regulatory approval in January and has since attracted significant inflows. According to Bloomberg, the introduction of options trading on the $43 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust is anticipated to reduce volatility while broadening Bitcoin’s investor base. Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, stated during a Bloomberg Television interview that as Bitcoin becomes more widely held, its volatility is likely to decrease. “Options will help dampen volatility, and as volatility comes down, people can take larger position sizes,” he explained. Thorn noted that a decrease in volatility could shift investor sentiment, encouraging them to view Bitcoin as a viable asset for fundamental use cases rather than merely a speculative gamble. The availability of options will also enable institutions to hedge their positions more effectively, increasing liquidity and potentially impacting retail trading during bullish market conditions. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart reported that on the first day of options trading, the total notional exposure for IBIT reached nearly $1.9 billion, spread across 354,000 contracts. Of these contracts, 289,000 were calls, while 65,000 were puts, resulting in a bullish call to put ratio of 4.4:1. Seyffart claimed that this overwhelming interest in call options contributed to Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs of $94,000 during Tuesday’s trading session for the market’s leading crypto. Balchunas, on the other hand, pointed out that the majority of options contracts are bullish, especially the December 20 call option, which essentially bets that the Bitcoin price will double within a month. This means that based on current prices, investors are expecting BTC to hit a new record high of little over $180,000 by that date. The put/call volume ratio for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was “impressive,” according to Balchunas, who noted that the ratio of 0.17 indicates strong bullish sentiment compared to other ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) with a ratio of 1.1. Market expert Marty Party highlighted in a social media post that options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust will settle in actual Bitcoin. This means that when an option contract is exercised, settlement will involve the delivery of Bitcoin, giving investors direct exposure to BTC price movements without the need to interact with crypto exchanges. At the time of writing, the market’s leading digital asset is trading at $91,580, up 4% in the weekly time frame after today’s bullish move to its new high.

My favorite genres are point-and-click puzzle adventures and narrative role-playing games, I prefer to enjoy video games alone, and I’m constitutionally noncompetitive. Given all that, you might wonder how I nevertheless spent eight years of my life playing World of Warcraft. Perhaps it was because, early in the life of the storied MMO, it gave me a glimpse of what it might be like to have an elite level of skill, and have that skill recognized by other players. My elite gamer moment wasn’t reaching max level in four expansions, or when my raid guilds put both Arthas and Deathwing in the ground — no. Nothing else in WoW, or other games, has captured the feeling I got by being a Hunter who could kite the General in Upper Blackrock Spire. That was the telltale message in the Looking For Group chat channel, circa 2005, that signaled one of base World of Warcraft’s most trying dungeon crawls. This message meant that a group of players was looking for more folks to attempt the 10-player dungeon called Upper Blackrock Spire. UBRS, as it was abbreviated, was a stepping-stone raid on the way to Molten Core, WoW’s very first 40-man raid tier. And it fit the part: Where Molten Core took place in the elemental plane of fire, UBRS was a lava-split fortress built inside an active volcano, full of black dragons, fire elementals, and even a Core Hound boss encounter, foreshadowing the use of the two-headed, lava-drooling beasts as the iconic basic mobs of Molten Core. To even get into Upper Blackrock Spire — back in the certifiably crunchier days of Vanilla World of Warcraft — you needed at least one member of the raid to have completed a circuitous questline involving a random item drop, a hidden NPC, at least one full run through the Lower Blackrock Spire dungeon, and a schlep all the way out to Dustwallow Marsh to subdue a random dragon because you need its fire breath, specifically. It took a lot to put a group together for UBRS, but, paradoxically, those groups were usually highly tenuous. Although UBRS required 10 people and a Big Raid-style questline to gain entry, it had the same level of loot as any other max-level, five-player dungeon. So, even if you were in a raiding guild, it was unlikely to be something they spent a raid night on — you’d have to rely on strangers to fill out your group, and you had to have at least one person who’d done all that work to get the key. And, on top of that, you needed a Hunter player who knew how to kite the General. The final boss of Upper Blackrock Spire was a centaur-dragon sort of guy called General Drakkisath. He was a big bruiser who hit very hard, but so did his two guards — they output so much damage on a single tank character that healers would get overwhelmed and you’d wipe. The most accepted way of defeating him was to have most of your group focus on killing the guards first, while one person got the General to chase them away from the rest of the fight, or “kite” him. And only the Hunter class, a ranged, physical damage-dealer with a pet, had the right combination of abilities to do it. The General ran faster than a basic player’s run speed — but Hunters could turn on Aspect of the Cheetah to get a speed boost. The General’s melee attacks hit so hard that he would quickly pulverize anyone but a tank who was receiving consistent healing — but the Hunter ability Distracting Shot could apply a taunt from range, keeping that Hunter from getting walloped. A Hunter could kite the General through several long, large rooms — including a narrow, railing-less pathway with a sheer drop on both sides — all the way back to the room of the previous boss fight. At that point, ideally, everybody else had managed to kill his guards, and the Hunter could use their Feign Death ability to zero out any interest the General had in them, then follow him back to the group in time to kick his ass. But a Hunter’s strictly mechanical abilities still weren’t enough to kite the General. Distracting Shot had a limited duration, and if you didn’t keep applying it, the General would get tired of chasing you and return too early, wiping your raid. But Distracting Shot could not be fired at something behind you, so you would have to turn around to hit him again. But, even with Aspect of the Cheetah, the General was so fast that if you stopped or ran in anything other than a straight line he’d catch up to you, turn you into paste, and then run back too early, wiping your raid. The solution rested entirely on whether or not the Hunter player could perform a trick: the jumpshot. The jumpshot takes advantage of how World of Warcraft’s jump physics work to get around the “you cannot fire a gun behind you” restriction. When you press the jump button, your character leaps briefly into the air. If you jump while running, your character continues the momentum they had before you pressed it, and their direction cannot change until they “hit” the ground again — normal jump physics for this genre of game. So, to perform a jumpshot, you start running, and hit the jump button. Then in the moment of time before your character comes back down, you whip your mouse around 180 degrees, fire off your ranged ability, and then whip your mouse back around 180 degrees again. Hopefully, you hit the ground pointing in roughly the same direction as when you started, and you’ve lost minimal, if any, forward momentum. Thanks to the new Distracting Shot you fired, General Drakkisath is still trying to kill you (which, remember, is what you want), and, if you did your jumpshot right, you haven’t slowed down enough for him to catch you. Now do it several more times, because his guards are tough, your group isn’t done with them yet, and you still have to cross that bridge with no railings. So you’ve beaten the odds. Your UBRS raid found 10 random players, including someone with the annoying key, and the right composition of tanks, healers, and DPS. It’s taken hours. You’ve done the tense tiptoe through the infamous Leeroy Jenkins room, where stepping on a single egg summons five billion deadly baby dragons. You’ve probably walked back from the ludicrously far away graveyard at least once, possibly because, if you played on a PvP server, there could be a 40-player raid group of the opposite faction setting up at the nearby entrance to Molten Core, and it was all too trivial for them to camp your corpses as you tried to get into UBRS. But you’ve done it: You’ve made it all the way to General Drakkisath, the final boss. And now the question of whether this will be a successful and complete run of Upper Blackrock Spire rests entirely on your shoulders. Nine strangers depending on you, the Hunter, to kite the General right. In an MMORPG, damage classes don’t get a lot of chances to feel like the hero of the raid. Your job is more about “don’t”s than “do”s. Do deliver the most damage mechanically possible by collecting the right gear. But don’t draw aggro, don’t stand in the fire, and don’t fuck up, because the healers aren’t going to be healing you — it’s a waste of resources. The real heroes of the raid are the tanks and the healers, by the way. If they die, that’s an emergency. If you die, it might be a little harder, but we’ll rez you when it’s over. Kiting the General, though, was a rite of passage. It was a skill passed down from more experienced Hunter players via word of mouth that you could use to be invited instantly to any UBRS group. It gave you a sense of ownership and belonging in your class; you weren’t just somebody who played a Hunter, you were a Hunter player. Now, I’m well aware that the jumpshot is not the highest caliber reflex skill the gaming world has to offer. It’s no Chicken Dinner, no Street Fighter championship, no Bloodborne using only a DDR pad. But World of Warcraft’s endgame culture was one of accepted guides and meticulously updated player-made calculators, of mathematically optimizing gear and button macros, creating ideal spell rotations, and memorizing focus fire order and boss patterns. Kiting the General wasn’t about how good you were at following the math. Either you, you the player, knew how to do it, or you didn’t. It wasn’t a just-right combo of class abilities that every character got by level X, or even a piece of loot that only had a 5% drop rate. To be a hunter who could kite the General was to be an elite in your category, based on your skill and interest in the game alone. In later updates to World of Warcraft, Blizzard made a concerted effort to move away from boss encounters that required specific classes to defeat. It was the right choice, as demonstrated by how gosh-dang difficult it was to put a good UBRS group together. And while I regretted that I was never given another boss fight on which to flex my Hunter pride, there’s still an upside. By eliminating the demand for class-specific strategies, Blizzard made the experience of playing that class-specific strategy even more rarified. So what if nobody needs to kite the General anymore? I’ll always be among the elite cadre of Hunter players who can say they did it, and World of Warcraft will be the closest I’ve ever come to that classic (and admittedly dubious) elite gamer cachet.

Title: From far-right gains to the economy: What’s at stake in Germany’s election?
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/20/from-far-right-gains-to-the-economy-whats-at-stake-in-germanys-election

Germans will head to the polls early next year after the coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. Berlin, Germany – In some countries, a snap election is held in a matter of weeks. Germany, by contrast, will enjoy a leisurely three months before it goes to the polls in an election that is likely to be overshadowed by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, an increasingly perilous situation in Ukraine, and a flagging domestic economy. Germany’s ruling “traffic light” coalition, formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) collapsed on November 6, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed his finance minister, FDP leader Christian Lindner. Scholz has announced a vote of confidence will take place on December 16. The snap poll is expected to take place on February 23. The three-way alliance formed after the 2021 elections was a rarity for Germany, and the FDP’s fiscal hawkishness always made an uneasy marriage with its centre-left partners, who campaigned in the 2021 elections on increased social and climate spending. The final break came during preparations for the 2025 budget, with Scholz arguing to pause Germany’s “debt brake”, which tightly limits public borrowing. Lindner insisted on demanding major public spending cuts and rolling back climate targets. Last week in the Bundestag, Scholz accused the FDP leader of pitting the government’s financial and military support for Ukraine against German pensioners. The national weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that the FDP had deliberately provoked Scholz to collapse the coalition and force an early election, which the party has denied. “It was difficult to reconcile those three very different political ideas and ideologies,” said Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, who believes infighting has weakened Germany’s position within the European Union at a time when the bloc is sorely in need of leadership. “The hope could be that the next elections will bring much more stable conditions to form a reliable government.” The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party are currently polling at 32 percent, according to a recent INSA poll, more than all three of the coalition parties put together. Friedrich Merz, a former BlackRock board member who has moved the party rightward since becoming leader in 2022, is therefore well-placed to become the next chancellor. Based on current polling, he could lead a government with the SPD – based on the latest predictions likely to secure 16 percent, as a junior partner, a return to the familiar “grand coalition” that was in place for three of Angela Merkel’s four terms, or with the Greens, which are polling at 12 percent. Merz has promised to roll back several of the coalition’s reforms, including on climate. He wants to lower taxes, reduce social welfare spending and tighten the country’s borders. “It is time for a fundamental course correction in migration, security, foreign and economic policy,” Merz told the Bundestag last week. Scholz, now the least popular chancellor in post-war German history according to polls, has indicated that he will run again as the party’s candidate. But many senior figures in the SPD want to make a clear break with his tenure, and quickly. If he is to be deposed, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is likely to replace him. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on course to record a historic result. Assessments from Germany’s domestic intelligence agency that several of the party’s state branches are right-wing extremist organisations have not prevented the party from polling second, at 20 percent. Though all other parties refuse to form a coalition with the AfD, a strong performance could increase its influence on powerful parliamentary committees. Meanwhile, the FDP and the socialist Left party are currently below the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament. The newly formed, left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is at 7 percent. Trump’s campaign promise to bring a quick end to the conflict in Ukraine, and threats to pull military assistance to President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s government, come at a time when the war-torn nation is losing ground to Russia in the east and facing major attacks on its energy infrastructure ahead of winter. If Trump follows through, Germany, Ukraine’s second-largest backer, will be expected to dig deep and massively increase its military spending. Scholz recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in two years. He tends to tread a more careful approach and has refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles out of fears of escalating the conflict. By comparison, Merz has been more hawkish on weapons deliveries and indicated he would approve the transfer, in line with the policies of the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Potentially adding further strain to the budget, Trump’s plans to slap 20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports would have severe consequences for the economy, as Germany remains heavily reliant on exporting manufactured goods. Europe’s largest economy is also its slowest growing. Though it has narrowly skirted recession, Germany’s central bank said on Tuesday that the present stagnation is likely to continue in the face of weak international demand and investment, and the prospect of new US tariffs. “We’re basically in a squeeze here. On the one hand, we probably have to deal with direct additional customs in the United States,” said Ziener. “On the other hand, we will probably be very much affected by high duties against Chinese products.” With no end in sight to the economic woes, more financial institutions and business representatives are calling for a reform of Germany’s debt brake to increase public investment, which has lagged for years. Merz, long known as a fiscal disciplinarian, has recently suggested an openness to reforming it, a possible sign of a shifting consensus. The constitutional-anchored measure limits borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but special investment off-budget funds worth hundreds of billions have been used to circumvent it. Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that advocates for reform of the debt brake, estimates that Germany requires public spending of $782bn before 2030, which it says can be achieved without constitutional amendments. “The deeper question is whether there’s a political majority for debt finance in Germany,” said Max Krahe, director of research at Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that campaigns for reform of the debt brake. “To say, yes, we are willing to use debt as a financing instrument to tackle all the problems in front of us, whether it’s defence, decarbonisation, infrastructure, competitiveness, education, healthcare.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor to pitch Bitcoin strategy to Microsoft’s board

Microsoft's cash-rich reserves could face a potential shift with Saylor's brief but powerful Bitcoin pitch. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Michael Saylor, prominent Bitcoin advocate and founder of MicroStrategy, will present a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors next month. In a Nov. 19 VanEck-hosted X Space, Saylor shared that he has been allotted three minutes to make a case for Bitcoin investment to Microsoft’s board of directors. While Saylor agreed to the brief presentation, he noted that his separate request to discuss the matter with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has not yet been accepted. He stated: “The activist that put that [Bitcoin purchase] proposal together contacted to me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation.” The development comes after Saylor made headlines last month by offering to help Microsoft generate a trillion dollars using a Bitcoin-based treasury strategy. In the October X post, Saylor asked Nadella to call him if he wants “to make the next trillion dollars for MSFT shareholders.” This offer followed news that Microsoft shareholders would vote on a proposal to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Microsoft’s board has recommended against adopting the proposal. However, market observers noted that key shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity would play pivotal roles in the firm’s eventual decision. Microsoft, holding $78 billion in cash reserves, has substantial investments in companies like Skype and OpenAI but has yet to allocate funds to Bitcoin or related assets. Saylor argues this strategy is short-sighted, urging tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google to view Bitcoin as a superior alternative to cash reserves. Saylor said: “If Apple bought $100 billion of Bitcoin, it would likely grow to $500 billion, and the company would have a $500 billion business growing at 20% a year.” Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over 330,000 Bitcoin valued at approximately $30 billion. Saylor often emphasizes how adopting Bitcoin as a treasury strategy has enabled MicroStrategy to outperform broader markets, presenting a compelling case for other corporations to follow suit.

Title: Bitcoin ATH: As BTC touches $94K, will THESE factors boost it to $100K?

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise past $94,000 marks a turning point, driven by election-fueled hype and institutional adoption. Bitcoin [BTC] reached a new all-time high, surpassing $94,000 on the 19th of November, extending its remarkable rally that began after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The king coin has surged nearly 35% from around $70,000 on election night. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s surge to an ATH of $94,000 — the coin’s price had dropped to the $92,000 mark at press time — has been driven by a confluence of short-term factors. The RSI climbed to 76.74, signaling strong bullish momentum yet entering overbought territory, suggesting potential caution for traders. OBV has risen sharply, reflecting sustained accumulation by large players, while trading volumes have remained robust, highlighting increased market activity. Media attention has played a pivotal role, with the presidential election sparking renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as speculative assets. The combination of increased mainstream visibility and institutional demand has fueled market enthusiasm. Speculation surrounding Bitcoin as a hedge against potential macroeconomic instability under Trump’s presidency has further amplified its rise. Additionally, whale activity in the market has been notable in the last few weeks, with large buy orders providing a foundation for the rally. However, with RSI approaching critical levels, traders may need to watch for consolidation or short-term corrections. While short-term catalysts have fueled Bitcoin’s recent surge, long-term factors have steadily supported its ascent. Over the past two months, institutional investments have surged, with asset managers like BlackRock increasing exposure to Bitcoin-backed ETFs, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Corporate treasuries, including Tesla’s, have bolstered holdings as Bitcoin solidifies its status as a digital store of value. Adoption has also expanded, with major payment platforms integrating Bitcoin into retail transactions. Notably, during the presidential election, speculation around Trump’s policy stance on crypto regulation reignited interest. Additionally, reports of Trump Media & Technology Group’s discussions to acquire the Bakkt platform have amplified market optimism. This potential acquisition is seen as a move to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream financial and media ecosystems, further legitimizing its role in global markets and sustaining bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin basks in its historic rally, potential challenges lie ahead. Regulatory responses are expected to take center stage, with global policymakers likely to scrutinize the cryptocurrency’s rapid ascent. Trump’s administration could influence crypto regulations, either bolstering adoption or dampening sentiment depending on its approach. Meanwhile, market corrections are also on the radar. With the RSI in overbought territory and whale-driven momentum at risk of cooling, short-term pullbacks are a possibility. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Many analysts have suggested that $90,000 could serve as a key support level, but any breach may spark a deeper correction. However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain robust, providing a strong foundation for continued growth, even amidst short-term volatility.

Title: Further 12 abuse survivors at Spiritan schools have come forward since September’s scoping inquiry

A further 12 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools have come forward since the scoping inquiry discovered 347 allegations of child sex abuse at the five schools in September. The scoping inquiry report found that there were allegations made against 67 alleged abuses at the Spiritan-run schools: Blackrock College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The incidents of sexual abuse were among a total of 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by the religious orders. The abuse was mostly described as having occurred from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, with the highest number of reported incidents occurring in the early to mid-1970s. The latest additional cases are disclosed in a newsletter from Restore Together, a voluntary support group for victims/survivors of sexual abuse in the Spiritan schools. “It is a well-documented fact that sex abuse is underreported and that is especially true of non-recent male, child sex abuse. We are acutely aware that there are many people affected by abuse who need support but have not yet made the very difficult decision to come forward,” the group said. Supported by past pupils’ unions at the five Spiritan schools, Restore Together has highlighted the availability of help and support for abuse survivors through the Spiritan Schools’ Restorative Programme. “There is an entirely confidential listening ear” available to people who may need it, the group said. “Expert therapy and counselling from independent professionals are available to all impacted by abuse, in all Spiritan institutions,” with costs paid for by the Spiritans, it said. “Our collective responsibility is to ensure that no Spiritan survivor of abuse will be left behind,” they said. The scoping inquiry uncovered 130 allegations made against 24 alleged abusers at Willow Park, the primary school next to Blackrock College, and 55 allegations against 13 abusers at Blackrock College itself. The next highest number of allegations was 60 relating to 18 alleged abusers at Rockwell College. There were 32 allegations made against six alleged abusers at St Mary’s College in Rathmines; 10 against four alleged abusers at St Michael’s primary and post-primary school in Ballsbridge; and five allegations against two alleged abusers at Templeogue College. Thirty-seven additional allegations were made against the Spiritans that were not connected to any school. “Child sex abuse is the most abhorrent issue in the history of the Spiritan schools,” Restore Together said. It is “criminal in nature, and horrific in its scale and impact” and though it may have taken place decades ago, it “continues to torment victims/survivors daily and destroy their lives.” Restore Together is in ongoing negotiations with the Spiritans about a redress scheme for survivors of abuse in their institutions. “Considerable progress has been made in recent months and a proposed scheme is in the final stages of review,” the group said. The group expects to launch its own website before Christmas, at www.restoretogether.ie Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor to present Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Can’t Afford to Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) stands against the other AI stocks investors can't afford to miss. According to a famous Wall Street brokerage Goldman Sachs, the S&P 500 index will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025. The US economy and corporate earnings are expected to continue growing, a key factor driving the optimism behind this forecast. Another brokerage, Morgan Stanley, has made a similar prediction, stating that US earnings will continue to grow in 2025. This can be expected if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates next year and there are signs of a stronger business cycle. The 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which are key tech giants leading in AI innovation, are likely to outperform the rest of the 493 companies in the benchmark index next year, Goldman notes. The outperformance, however, is only predicted to be by 7 percentage points, the slimmest margin in seven years.

(NYSE:KEYS) is a global technology company that provides electronic design and test solutions that support the development and optimization of AI-driven technologies. On November 18, Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) announced the launch of their new Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software portfolio that transforms the way engineers handle challenges related to next-generation technologies. Their suite of EDA leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Python integrations; speeding up the design process and time taken for complex RF and chiplet products. In turn, this enables easier development of advanced solutions for 5G/6G and data center applications. “AI is transforming how engineers approach complex design challenges. Automating traditionally time-intensive tasks enables engineers to focus on innovation rather than repetitive refinements, resulting in real productivity gains. The foundation for the practical application of AI and ML is first having an open, interoperable workflow and then providing turn-key solutions tuned for specific applications. It's a fascinating time, and AI and ML will undoubtedly be a huge driver of design innovation in the future”. Overall KEYS ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors can't afford to miss. While we acknowledge the potential of KEYS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Subway rival Jersey Mike’s Subs acquired by Blackstone in $8B deal

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/19/2024 5:01:59 PM PST by xxqqzz Blackstone has agreed to buy Jersey Mike’s Subs, the sandwich chain said Tuesday, in a deal that a source said valued the company at around $8 billion, including debt. Reuters had reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Blackstone was nearing a deal for Jersey Mike’s. The deal, which is expected to close in early 2025, underscores private equity (PE) firms’ increasing interest in franchise operators. Last year, PE firm Roark Capital agreed to buy Subway, Jersey Mike’s bigger rival, in a deal valued at up to $9.55 billion. Jersey Mike’s, known for its submarine sandwiches, traces its roots back to 1956 when Cancro started working at the company’s Point Pleasant, NJ., location, which was founded as Mike’s Subs. Cancro acquired the location in 1975 and began franchising units in 1987. Since then, Jersey Mike’s has grown into one of the major fast-casual restaurant chains in America with over 3,000 locations nationwide open and in development. “We believe we are still in the early innings of Jersey Mike’s growth story and that Blackstone is the right partner to help us reach even greater heights,” Jersey Mike’s founder and CEO Peter Cancro said.

Title: New judge to hear Rosmah’s case
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/11/20/new-judge-to-hear-rosmahs-case
Time Published: 2024-11-19T23:00:00Z
Full Content:
Wednesday, 20 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor over the alleged purchase of luxury goods using 1MDB monies will be heard before a different judge. This is following Judicial Commissioner Leong Wai Hong allowing Rosmah’s application to recuse him from presiding over the case. In a brief decision yesterday, Leong said he recused himself on the principle of justice. In Rosmah’s supporting affidavit, she stated that the judicial commissioner was a partner and head of litigation and arbitration at law firm Messrs Skrine between 2011 and 2021. Rosmah contended that at the material time at Skrine, which acted for the plaintiff in the present case, the law firm had relations to lawsuits including investigation into 1MDB and her husband, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister then. “After considering the application, I agree to recuse myself from hearing this suit on the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. “In the premise, I allow the application. This suit will be heard before another High Court judge,” Leong said. This is the second time Rosmah applied for the recusal of the judge in the lawsuit. She, however, failed in her first recusal application. On Sept 9, High Court judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid dismissed Rosmah’s recusal application, stating that Rosmah failed to prove any real danger of bias if she continues to preside over the civil suit. Justice Adlin said she was in charge of the corporate division when she was with the law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill (LHAG), while all affairs related to 1MDB were handled by the legal division. It is understood that Justice Adlin was transferred to New Commercial Courts (NCC) from the Civil division, resulting in the lawsuit being brought before Leong. On May 9, 1MDB, SRC International Sdn Bhd and nine subsidiaries filed the civil lawsuit against Rosmah and another individual seeking US$346mil belonging to the company. The plaintiffs claimed that Rosmah had used the funds from the companies to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. Apart from 1MDB and SRC, other plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd and Global Diversified Investment Company Ltd (formerly 1MDB Global Investments Ltd). The other plaintiffs also include Affinity Equity International Partners Ltd, Alsen Chance Holdings Ltd, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Ltd, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd and Brightstone Jewellery Ltd. They named Rosmah as first defendant and Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (known as Natasha Mirpuri) as second defendant. They claimed Shabnam, who is based in Singapore, had purchased or procured the luxury items on Rosmah’s behalf. The plaintiffs claimed that funds from 1MDB and its subsidiaries were channelled to various offshore entities – including Affinity Equity, Alsen Chance, Blackrock Commodities, Blackstone Asia and Brightstone Jewellery – before being paid out to 48 different vendors based in 14 jurisdictions for the luxury goods. They further claimed the goods sought were “traceable substitute” of 1MDB and its subsidiaries’ trust property, thus the plaintiffs had an equitable proprietary interest in the luxury goods. They are seeking a court declaration that they have an equitable proprietary interest in the good and traceable proceeds in the hands of Rosmah as well as an order for Rosmah to pay the first until the sixth plaintiffs a sum of US$346mil.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Fresh Record High Above $94,000 As Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Trading Kicks Off

The price of Bitcoin punched past another all-time high above the $94,000 mark on Tuesday after options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) officially went live, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) product kicking things off. BlackRock and other asset managers have been seeking to list and trade options for their spot BTC ETFs following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs in January. Although the SEC greenlighted the listing and trading options for the IBIT in September, the approval by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) on Monday represented the last major hurdle before their launch today. “A few hundred million so far in options volume on IBIT (a ton for day one),” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. Balchunas also pointed out that the huge majority of the contracts were calls, suggesting bets that BTC’s price would continue rocketing. According to industry pundit and head of growth at Bitcoin custody firm Theya, Joe Consorti, the launch of options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is a huge boon for the top crypto as additional liquidity could unlock a fresh tsunami of institutional and retail investors. “The floodgates for Bitcoin’s next evolution in financial markets are about to open. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options, specifically for the IBIT vehicle, marks the beginning of a new era for price dynamics, volatility, and institutional adoption,” Consorti posited in a Nov. 19 post on X. Spot bitcoin ETF options begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow.Here's why it matters.[B2YB @TheyaBitcoin] pic.twitter.com/BgDXmXI66M Consorti noted that options are the cornerstone of capital markets as they offer liquidity, risk management tools, and price discovery, specifically for institutional investors that “drive a lot of the core of the market.” “This matters because, in traditional markets, derivatives are 10 to 20 times the size of the underlying market cap,” he explained, before adding that with Bitcoin, listed derivatives are less than 1% of the $1.8 trillion spot market cap. Consorti stated that Bitcoin derivatives are considerably underdeveloped, which hampers the market’s maturity. There is a massive demand for these products from institutional investors to hedge their positions. The expert further said that the majority of Bitcoin derivatives are traded offshore or over the counter on platforms like Deribit, which currently boasts over $30 billion in open interest, while US investors remain sidelined. The US stock market is currently the world’s biggest and most liquid, consisting of 45% of the $110 trillion global stock market, he observed, adding: “Listing options on Bitcoin ETFs brings BTC into the largest capital market in the world and unlocks unprecedented opportunities because of this, namely liquidity in depth.” Retail investors that previously had no access can now foray into the Bitcoin derivatives market, increasing the user base considerably. Bitcoin reached a new peak of $94,040.99 early today per data from CoinGecko. At press time, the BTC price had retraced slightly to $93,567.61, still up 2.6% over the past 24 hours. The market cap of the benchmark crypto has now swelled to as high as $1.85 trillion.

As DOGE shows absolute correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum strays further to a three-year low. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of $93,970.91 on Nov. 19, roughly $500 above its previous price peak less than a week ago. BTC rose 3% over the past 24 hours. According to CryptoSlate data, Solana (SOL) closely followed Bitcoin’s performance, with a 2.7% price increase, reaching $244 at the time of publication. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) stood still with a 0.1% drawdown in the same period, priced at $3,128.78. Notably, ETH has accumulated a negative 5% performance over the past seven days, despite its spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) net flows becoming positive recently. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted that ETH reached a three-year low correlation with BTC, as the pair’s Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.3 points. He added: “Just because BTC is strong doesn’t mean you should buy ETH. Each asset is now following its own path.” The Pearson Correlation Coefficient tracks the relation between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. The closer the relation gets to 1 point, the more positively correlated the variables are. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its bullish momentum, rising 10.7% daily to $0.408, its highest price since early June 2021. According to DefiLlama, DOGE’s correlation with BTC has been 0.99 over the past month. The new price peak comes amid boosted optimism following the start of options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the ratio between calls and puts on IBIT’s options closed at 0.17. This ratio means much more interest in calls than puts, which is a bullish setup. He added: “For context, this ratio for $SPY is 1.1 and $TSLA is .59 while $TLT is .79.” In the first hours of trading, IBIT’s options registered over $446 million in volume, which Balchunas called “a ton” for an opening trading day.

IBIT traded 73,000 options contracts in the first 60 mins of trading Tuesday, Nasdaq told CNBC, placing the fund in the top 20 of the most active nonindex options. Options trading allows investors to play bitcoin's notorious volatility by letting them buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price based on whether they anticipate the price will rise or fall in a given period. "Bitcoin has a lively derivatives market, but in the U.S. it is still tiny compared to other asset classes, and is largely limited to institutional players," said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the "Crypto is Macro Now" newsletter. "A deeper onshore derivatives market will enhance the growing market sophistication. This will reinforce investor confidence in the asset, bringing in new cohorts while enabling a greater variety of investment and trading strategies … [That] should, all else being equal, dampen both volatility and downside." The market for options contracts on major ETFs can be extremely active, and are widely used by more sophisticated traders. For example, over the past five business days, Interactive Brokers clients have more options orders on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) than for the funds themselves, according to data from the brokerage. The launch of the bitcoin ETF options will likely also lead to new funds that incorporate those options, said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas. "Grayscale already did a filing for a covered call [fund], and I'm sure BlackRock will come out with it too. And then we're going to get buffers, and then we're going to get whatever other trend-following-type strategy that folks think of. I think the ecosystem's really going to start to fly here," Sohn said. Spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January and have been hailed as the most successful ETF launches in history. Other bitcoin ETFs are expected to have options available as soon as this week. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the rule changes filed by the New York Stock Exchange, which lists the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and Cboe Global Markets, which lists the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).
