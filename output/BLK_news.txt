Title: Gold tops $4.6K as crypto enters macro week: Coincidence or early warning?

Rates spike, liquidity shifts: Is crypto at risk? The crypto market is heading into another macro-heavy week. This time, however, the main headwind is “rate cuts.” From the recent fallout between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell to tariff-related FUD and the upcoming CPI report, all roads lead back to rate expectations. The logic is simple: as Q1 unfolds, traders are pricing in rate cuts as a bullish catalyst for crypto, and with roughly $200 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, liquidity is stacking up for a potential risk-on rotation. Source: X However, smart money clearly splits on the outlook. On one side, $1.2 trillion BlackRock is calling for a 3% Fed rate cut. On the flip side, JPMorgan, the world’s largest bank, is hawkish, projecting no rate cuts “this year,” with other big players like Barclays backing that view. In fact, even Willy Woo has flagged a bearish outlook for crypto in 2026. Naturally, with volatility ramping up, Bitcoin [BTC] faces a test of its “safe-haven” status. The big question: Have traders already priced in this setup? Traditional assets are back in the spotlight, hitting fresh highs. Gold (XAU), for instance, topped $4,630 on the 12th of January, syncing with the growing macro FUD around crypto. According to AMBCrypto, the big question is, is this just a “coincidence” or an early warning for risk assets? Looking at 2025, this rotation doesn’t feel random. Gold closed the year with a 65% ROI, while BTC lagged at -6%. The result? The Bitcoin/Gold ratio has slipped to 20, meaning it now takes 20 ounces of gold to match one Bitcoin, down from 35 ounces at the start of the year. Source: LongTermTrends In essence, crypto FUD gave gold a boost in the 2025 cycle. Notably, the same pattern is playing out now. Gold and Silver are breaking into all-time highs “together.” Looking back at 2025, this kind of rotational move always lined up with stress building under the U.S. economy. Now, that’s where rate cuts come into play. With recent macro FUD flipping the market hawkish, the odds of a cut sit at just 5%. In this climate, the upcoming macro week is primed to put crypto under pressure, with Gold’s breakout acting as an “early” warning sign.

Title: Trump set to lead largest-ever US delegation to World Economic Forum in Davos next week

GENEVA (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will return to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting of business, political and cultural elites in Davos, Switzerland, next week, leading a record-large U.S. delegation, organizers said Tuesday. The Geneva-based think tank says Trump, whose assertive foreign policy on issues as diverse as Venezuela and Greenland in recent months has stirred concerns among U.S. friends and foes alike, will be accompanied by five Cabinet secretaries and other top officials for the event running from Monday through Jan. 23. A total of 850 CEOs and chairs of the world’s top companies will be among the 3,000 participants from 130 countries expected in the Alpine resort this year, the forum says. Forum President Borge Brende says six of the Group of Seven leaders — including Trump — will attend, as well as presidents Volodymyr Zelenskky of Ukraine, Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria and others. A total of 64 heads of state or government are expected so far — also a record — though that number could increase before the start of the event, he said. China’s delegation will be headed by Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing’s top trade official, Brende said. Among the scores of other high-profile attendees expected are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as well as tech industry titans Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Brende said the U.S. delegation will include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff. The forum, which held its first annual meeting in 1971, has long been a hub of dialogue, debate and deal-making. Trump has already attended twice while president, and was beamed in by video last year just days after being inaugurated for his second term. Critics call it a venue for the world’s elites to hobnob and do business that sometimes comes at the expense of workers, the impoverished or people on the margins of society. The forum counters that its stated goal is “improving the state of the world” and insists many advocacy groups, academics and cultural leaders have an important role too. This year’s edition will be the first annual meeting not headed by forum founder Klaus Schwab, who resigned last year. He’s been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of New York-based investment management company BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings.

Pirates, Plunderers & Predators… The US criminal terrorist organization and its banks, mega-corporations, and secret drug enforcement units are now openly stealing property and presidents and running terror-style operations while the social propagandists roll out fake videos of people who ‘own nothing but are happy’.

For my trouble, I got a WARNING that said “You’ve offended Mossad”. As I talk about the past week’s clown show, Banana republic, cheap ass propaganda and lies, I’m battling “truth” salesmen Alex Jones, Tim Pool, Nick Fuentes who are full-on shilling for the Slave System and its government bodies and elite institutions. In this game, I’m tracking the Venezuela takeover – ruthless, bloodless and not in the least suspicious. BlackRock gets bitcoin. JP Morgan gets silver. Benjamin Mileikowsky gets to hand-pick a new anti-Iran, pro-Israhell regime. And, Trump gets Mar-A-Venezuela. Next up: Colombia and Cuba (both of which have some pretty great riviera estate for Trump Towers and golf courses). And, Greenland. Because national defense and so on, you know. Of course, if you were really going to round up the world’s worst dictators and druglords, the Clintons, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Bidens and Trumps would all be on death row, along with Anthony Fraudci, Kill Gates, Albert Bourla and the rest.

Title: Trump criminal probe of Fed Chair Powell marks unprecedented escalation — and a warning to his successor

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank had been served by the Justice Department in connection with allegations related to congressional testimony on the renovation of the bank’s headquarters. (Credit: Federal Reserve) President Donald Trump's criminal probe targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell marks an extraordinary escalation in his battle with the central bank, sending a clear warning to the next Fed chair about the risks of defying the White House. Powell confirmed the Department of Justice investigation on Sunday evening in a video statement, calling the move "unprecedented" and another example of what he described as the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to intimidate the central bank. Powell's decision to respond so publicly, after days of private consultation with advisers, marked a sharp departure from the central banker's typically measured approach. TRUMP VS THE FEDERAL RESERVE: HOW THE CLASH REACHED UNCHARTED TERRITORY U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the Trump administration's criminal investigation in a video statement. (Al Drago/AFP/Getty Images) The probe focuses on whether Powell was truthful during congressional testimony about the project to overhaul the Fed's two main buildings on the National Mall. No charges have been filed, and Powell has denied any wrongdoing. The White House referred questions to the Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said Monday that her office proceeded with the probe after failing to receive a response from Powell, prompting prosecutors to initiate a legal process. "The United States Attorney’s Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman’s congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat," Pirro stated. "The word "indictment" has come out of Mr. Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach." Powell, widely viewed as one of the most crisis-tested Federal Reserve chairs in modern U.S. history, built his career as a lawyer and investment banker in New York before entering public service in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. He joined the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in 2012 and was tapped to lead the central bank in 2017. Now, a criminal investigation may represent the biggest test of Powell’s leadership, unfolding as Trump weighs his choice for the next Fed chair with Powell’s term set to expire in May. President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to tour the ongoing renovation. (Official White House photo by Daniel Torok) The next Fed chair would take on one of the most powerful economic jobs in the country, helping decide how expensive it is to borrow money for things like homes, cars and credit cards. Those decisions directly affect the cost of everyday living for Americans. FROM MORTGAGES TO CAR LOANS: HOW AFFORDABILITY RISES AND FALLS WITH THE FED Trump has narrowed his shortlist to four candidates as he approaches a final decision on leadership at the Fed: Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller and Rick Rieder. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been a loyal supporter of Trump's economic agenda. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Kevin Hassett is Trump’s top economic advisor and a loyal defender of the administration’s policies. He currently serves as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, and held two senior roles during Trump’s first term and advised the president on economic policy during the 2024 campaign. POWELL REVEALS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STEP DOWN FROM THE FED AS PRESSURE MOUNTS Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley banker, has emerged as a vocal critic of current Fed leadership, sharpening his attacks as he positioned himself as a potential replacement for Powell. He became the youngest person to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2006. Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, was long considered for Treasury Secretary before Trump ultimately tapped Scott Bessent. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller has repeatedly called for rate cuts, a move that aligns, in part, with Trump's demands. Of the candidates, he is considered the veteran academic of the group. He has also reiterated the importance of maintaining an independent Federal Reserve. And BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder is the last candidate to have an interview with Trump before the president makes his decision. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who did pre-interviews with all the candidates, said Trump is expected to announce his decision by the end of January. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill said they would block the confirmation of Trump's Federal Reserve nominee until the legal matter is resolved. As the investigation unfolds and a decision on the next Fed chair approaches, the episode underscores the growing political pressure surrounding a role long viewed as insulated from the White House.

Title: BlackRock to slash hundreds of jobs — latest Wall Street biz to kick off 2026 with firings

BlackRock is reportedly slashing hundreds of jobs across the company, making it the latest Wall Street giant to start the New Year with sweeping layoffs. The world’s largest asset manager plans to cut 250 jobs, or roughly 1% of its global headcount, across its investment and sales teams, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It’s unclear when the layoffs may take place or what is the driving force behind them, though rival banks and asset managers have linked job cuts at their own businesses to restructuring, cost-cutting, artificial intelligence and economic uncertainty. CitiGroup is set to axe about 1,000 jobs this week and UBS Group AG is planning a round of layoffs this month, with another round later this year, according to Bloomberg. A BlackRock spokesperson cast the company’s layoffs as a bid to become more efficient. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future.” Shares in the asset management firm – which recorded roughly $13.5 trillion in assets at the end of September – fell roughly 1% Tuesday. BlackRock declined to comment to The Post. The company, which has about 24,600 employees, led two rounds of layoffs last year, each time slashing roughly 1% of its workforce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been looking to lead the company deeper into alternative investments. The firm closed a $12 billion acquisition of alternative credit manager HPS Investment Partners in July. Since then, it has been integrating new executives and readying a new range of funds for investors. In its 2026 investment outlook, BlackRock said it will focus on investment themes such as artificial intelligence, income and diversification. “The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of equity exchange-traded funds, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” last week. “Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The firm still sees artificial intelligence as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle, and doesn’t believe it’s dying down anytime soon, Jacobs said. BlackRock is one of the few companies that offers specialized AI-focused funds, like its Tech Active ETF that has amassed more than $8 billion in assets. Income is another major focus this year because BlackRock expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates again, a move that would pressure yields on cash investments, Jacobs said. Diversification is the third focus in BlackRock’s annual report because investors are looking for new assets. “Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?” he told CNBC. “Something that’s going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.” The company is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: Franklin Templeton retrofits money market funds for tokenized stablecoin market

Franklin Templeton is amending institutional money market funds to support stablecoin reserves and onchain cash use without launching new crypto-native products. Cointelegraph in your social feed Franklin Templeton has amended two Western Asset institutional money market funds (MMFs) to plug directly into the emerging US stablecoin regime and tokenized cash infrastructure rather than launching new crypto native products. According to a release shared with Cointelegraph, Franklin Templeton is adapting the two long‑running Western Asset institutional funds so they can be used more directly in US GENIUS‑aligned stablecoin reserve structures and blockchain‑enabled distribution channels, without changing their status as Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered 2a‑7 MMFs. The changes are designed to allow the funds to serve as regulated, government-backed collateral for payment stablecoins and other tokenized cash uses without altering their core regulatory status. ​Franklin Templeton’s Western Asset Institutional Treasury Obligations Fund (LUIXX) invests exclusively in short‑term US government obligations and is structured to be compatible with GENIUS Act reserve requirements, positioning it as plug‑and‑play infrastructure for payment stablecoin treasuries and bank‑style issuers that need SEC‑registered, government‑only collateral. Its Western Asset Institutional Treasury Reserves Fund (DIGXX), on the other hand, has added a blockchain‑enabled “Digital Institutional” share class on top of its existing 2a‑7 structure, intended to make it usable as 24/7, onchain collateral and cash management for tokenization platforms, custodians and broker‑dealers that want digital rails without moving into an unregistered vehicle. Related: XRP jumps 8% as Franklin Templeton, Grayscale ETFs begin trading Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, told Cointelegraph that the company expects stablecoin reserves to be managed “in both tokenized and more traditional form,” and sees room for both exclusive and multi‑manager mandates as more financial institutions launch their own tokens. He said that several “significant products in the stablecoin market” are “backed by traditional high-quality short-term issuance through non-digitally native product structures,” including the recently launched FRNT stablecoin in the State of Wyoming, and the company sees opportunities to help such partners through its investment management expertise. Franklin Templeton’s role, he said, is to manage reserves “in the product model [clients] prefer,” whether via bespoke portfolios or open‑end mutual funds. Bayston cast the amendments as incremental rather than experimental, noting that Western Asset’s institutional Treasury fund only needed “relatively minor adjustments” to sit inside the GENIUS framework and complement Franklin Templeton’s existing onchain products. In his view, many large clients still want familiar, SEC‑registered 2a‑7 wrappers as they plug into onchain distribution and collateral systems, so the company is extending a digital stack across a broader liquidity “suite” instead of forcing migration to new vehicles. Related: Franklin Templeton expands Benji tokenization platform to Canton Network ​Rather than tying the new digital share class to a single collateral or tokenization platform, Franklin Templeton plans to support access through multiple “trusted partners” as banks, broker‑dealers and other intermediaries roll out their own blockchain‑enabled frontends. Franklin Templeton is not alone in repositioning money funds for stablecoin reserves under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock announced plans to modify a Treasury money market fund in October 2025, aimed at serving as an authorized reserve asset for US stablecoin issuers, tightening its investment mandate to short‑dated Treasurys and overnight repo (short‑term, secured funding), to align with the new federal framework. BlackRock was already managing a bespoke government MMF for Circle’s USDC reserves, as large asset managers increasingly see regulated cash funds as backend rails for tokenized dollars rather than purely retail cash products.

January 13, 2026 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Ben Hunt, co-founder Perscient, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. This is Masters in business with Barry Riol on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: On the latest Masters in Business podcast. What a fascinating conversation. I sit down with Ben Hunt, he writes Epsilon Theory, but he is also the president and co-founder of Persuent. What a fascinating analytic story they’ve put together. They essentially take feeds of everything that’s published around the world, whether it’s in English or Chinese or Russian. They create these large language models and use artificial intelligence to identify rising narratives. In other words, they’re looking for the things that will become storylines, but haven’t quite hit that yet. I I found this conversation to be absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Persuent Ben Hunt. Ben Hunt, welcome to Bloomberg. Ben Hunt: Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: This is long. time coming Ben Hunt: I love the intro. I gotta have you at all my events. It’s fantastic. Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. I’m available for hire. I can introduce you at, at weddings bar Mitzvahs. Wherever you’re giving a toast, I’ll be happy to tee you up. This is long overdue. I’ve followed your work for so long. I’m fascinated by both what you put out in your blog, Epsilon Theory, thank you, and which is now a blog and a newsletter and, and the work you do at persuent. We’re going to get to that stuff, but before we do, I gotta ask PhD from Harvard. You were a tenured political science professor. Was academia the original career plan? Ben Hunt: You know, it’s interesting, Barry. So I, academia was always a, I’ll call it a, a way station for me. It ended up being Barry Ritholtz: A 10 year way station? Ben Hunt: 10 years plus grad school. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a little more than a way station. I Ben Hunt: A little more than a waste station. But I bet this will be familiar for a lot of your listeners. I always had an entrepreneurial bug. You know, I started my first company when I was in grad school, started another one when I was, when I was a professor. And as I know, you know, a lot of your listeners, viewers know, it is, it is a bug. It’s not a feature. Barry Ritholtz: Yes, for sure. Ben Hunt: You can’t help yourself. And academia is not the place to be an aca, Barry Ritholtz: So let me ask you a question about that. Ben Hunt: An academia for sure. So I know why I’ve started a series of companies. I can’t work for other people. Why, why did you have that bug? What, what motivated you to say, I gotta get this out into the world? Barry Ritholtz: I love playing games and solving problems. I have a similar issue about working for other people, which fortunately, academia solves that to a large degree. I mean, you, you are working on your own stuff. You follow your own intellectual bliss in a way that I’ve really never rediscovered. The the problem with academia, of course, is, you know, it’s very, very low stakes. That’s why the academic fights are so vicious, because Ben Hunt: There’s nothing at stake. Right, right. And, and that that is actually true. That’s actually true. And, and so you learn survival techniques and that kind of jungle where nothing is really at stake, at least monetarily, because the, the goal of any sort of academia conference or presentation, like, is to appear smart. Right? It’s not to actually be smart. You’re not actually listening to a presentation to listen to it. What you learn to do is you’re listening to the presentation the whole time. You’re trying to calculate your head. What’s the most devastating question I can ask? 00:04:07 [Speaker Changed] So you’re gonna rock this guy back on his heels with a devastating, a 00:04:11 [Speaker Changed] Devastating question. And boy, that gets old after a while, Barry, I gotta tell you. Yeah. It, it really does. I, I loved the teaching. I loved the, the research. ’cause like I say, nobody tells you what to work on, but the, the church of academia, the, the actual institution of academia, a it’s for the birds, even back when I was doing it. Right. And I think it’s gotten significantly worse. 00:04:40 [Speaker Changed] I can imagine. I can imagine what’s happening with that. So, but the question that this leads me to is, yeah, you’ve had all these jobs within the world of finance. How did your background in academia shape how you view investing? Risk management allocation? 00:04:57 [Speaker Changed] Barry, starting from academia and then getting into our business of investing, I think it was the best thing that could have happened for me for when I got into it, which was kind of later in life, right? Same, same. You know, after I left academia finally to start a software company. And it, after we sold that software company Yeah. A, a a buddy of mine that I think this happens a lot. A buddy of, you know, you have a buddy who’s in the 00:05:29 [Speaker Changed] Business, Hey, you seem to be pretty smart. How would you like to apply this to 00:05:32 [Speaker Changed] This? We’re always, we’re always talking about company X or technology Y why don’t, you know, why don’t you come in? Let’s, let’s give this a try. So that was my path, if you want to call it a path. And what really sold me on it was that markets, it’s the biggest game in the world 00:05:52 [Speaker Changed] For sure. 00:05:54 [Speaker Changed] And like I say, I’m a game player. I love games 00:05:57 [Speaker Changed] And a game theorist. Let’s, let’s, let’s work down that. 00:06:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I don’t like to talk about that because, you know, because the, 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] The real game theorists get angry. 00:06:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well, yes. And, and, and I, I understand I am a real one because that was, that was my field for a while. And it’s a real field and it’s a real thing. But it’s been so trivialized when some talking head will come on. Well, let’s look at the game theory of this. Right? And you just want to just, you know, right. Shoot yourself when somebody does this. 00:06:25 [Speaker Changed] So, so the other part of your research, the other part of your academic focus was on narrative theory. And so let’s talk about how did that focus develop? And, and we will talk a little later about what you do today at Persuent with the narrative machine. But what, and 00:06:46 [Speaker Changed] Believe it or not, believe it or not, it all ties together. I, 00:06:48 [Speaker Changed] I doesn’t don’t doubt that for a second. And, 00:06:50 [Speaker Changed] And it’s 00:06:51 [Speaker Changed] What initially led you down that rabbit hole. 00:06:54 [Speaker Changed] When we think about kind of who’s been an influence on you in your, in your life, had a very influential undergrad professor in political science. And then I had a very influential graduate advisor. Again, they don’t call it political science in, up at, up at Harvard. They call it government or something. Right? Something like that. But, but it’s political science. And, and the reason I say they were influential is that they really got me focused on the science side of political science 00:07:30 And that science side. Yes. It’s kind of some of the typical terrible stuff you see in all social sciences, like economics, where, you know, you’ve gotta learn how to deal with structured data. Right. And, and there was, there was a lot to learn. And I, it’s, it’s worth talking about because I see the same mistakes being made over and over again by people in our business who want to try to, well, you know, apply math to data and, and there are some real pitfalls and some, some real intellectual capital I think that you can achieve within academia that you can then bring in and apply to the, the, the investment world. What, 00:08:20 [Speaker Changed] What we’ve certainly seen amongst the quants, a very successful application of math theory to data. The, in fact, some of the best performing hedge funds are quantitatively driven. That’s not where you’re going. 00:08:37 [Speaker Changed] Well, it’s, it’s part of where I’m going. Right? So, so there, there, there’s a transition in all of all of the sciences, honestly, but certainly the, the social sciences where, where, yes, you start with numbers, structured numbers, right. Price over time, you know, things you can calculate and measure as those numbers. But what was clear immediately in politics, and I think has become increasingly clear in the world of investing, is that it’s not just the numbers that you get on your Bloomberg terminal, it’s also the words and the stories and the narratives that are told to us. Politicians have known this forever, right? So the story of politics is the story of people suggesting laws or policies and then having to present it in a way that gets them elected or keeps them in power or whatever that is. So there’s always been a focus, I’ll say more of a focus in political science than in economics with words. Economics is almost seen as a, as a sideline. Right? It, it’s somehow lesser than the numbers. Right. So what, what I was kind of early on was applying the same techniques that we have for understanding, you know, matrices and structured data, but applying it to unstructured data, which, you know, full circle, this is at the heart of all of the generative AI and the, the AI that we have today. 00:10:28 [Speaker Changed] Well, you’re, you’re getting way ahead of me now with generative ai. We’ll circle back to that. Yeah. But, but 00:10:32 [Speaker Changed] It’s all the, the math has not changed. Right. In 35 years since I started working with network math around unstructured data. I mean, we, we didn’t call it natural language processing back then, and we didn’t call it, you know, large language modeling, but that’s exactly what we were doing. 00:10:53 [Speaker Changed] So what was, what was the moment or the catalyst for you to say, Hey, I’m working in all these other areas, but the narratives continue to pop up over and over again on all sorts of different data sets. And I think in the financial markets, I can use a, a novel approach to identifying narratives and anticipate where the market’s going. What, what led to that sort of in insight, 00:11:25 [Speaker Changed] Not the, not the Great Recession, right? But the aftermath, 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] Meaning the 2010s following the great financial crisis, 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] Starting in, in, in 2009, and the recovery that we had out of 2009, and in particular when Win Ben Berke and the Federal Reserve move towards a very explicit effort to use their words to impact markets. 00:11:53 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about that. ’cause I have some really specific memories of the low, of the, the runup afterwards, all the noise Yeah. That was going on. Some of the phrases that have come out of that era, like financial repression and other such things are, are just the tip of the narrative iceberg. So, so walk us through your insight. It’s 2009. Yep. The market bottoms really kind of a v bottom and took off from that. What was that, March 9th, March 7th, something like that. Yep. Oh nine. And there was no turning back. What were you seeing? How were you integrating that into a concept of let’s identify narratives in order to anticipate market moves? Well, 00:12:47 [Speaker Changed] So I was co-founded a, a long short fund inside of a, a larger asset manager going back in oh five and oh 5, 0 6, 0 7. We did well, like everyone else did. Well. And then in oh eight we did great. 00:13:08 [Speaker Changed] Really? In oh eight, we did great. Oh eight, I think I wanna say s and p down 37% something. Yeah. We 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] Were up 20 something net. 00:13:14 [Speaker Changed] Anything in the green, not in the red is 00:13:16 [Speaker Changed] Smith. Yeah. Amazing. And, and now I’ll tell you, and we can come back to this, like, the real question you should ask is that given what we believed, why wasn’t, why weren’t we up 40%? That, that’s actually, that, that’s actually a question you can ask. But 00:13:33 [Speaker Changed] I I’m, I’m gonna say a 47% relative price swing. I, I, I’ll take, 00:13:39 [Speaker Changed] Had a, had a, had a great year in oh eight and, and 00:13:42 [Speaker Changed] Did that continue in oh nine 00:13:45 [Speaker Changed] Flatlined. 00:13:46 [Speaker Changed] Alright. 00:13:47 [Speaker Changed] From oh nine, so from March of oh nine. So we did well in January 1st quarter, February and the first quarter, right. The rest from, from March of oh nine, our returns flatlined. So we never, we never lost money for our clients in our fund. But 00:14:01 [Speaker Changed] You didn’t catch that recovery. That 00:14:03 [Speaker Changed] V did not catch the recovery. Absolutely did not. And the, the recovery was interesting, right? You’re, you’re right. There was a v but there were, there were starts and stops to it. So the, the big move up from the bottom in late March going into April, it’s like, all right, that actually we caught a little bit of that and that that made sense, right? There was a second leg to the rally. Oh, for sure. April, may. And then in June, in June, June to October was a ferocious rally. 00:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Ferocious is the right word, but, 00:14:40 [Speaker Changed] But June in particular was a classic crap rally. 00:14:45 [Speaker Changed] Right. Meaning it was a low 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] Quality, right. Low quality stuff. Right. The, the end of March going into April rally, it was Right. This makes sense, right? We bottomed fed the June rally. No, no, it was, we didn’t, we didn’t touch any Oh, 00:15:03 [Speaker Changed] That’s a, that’s fascinating. Go back, 00:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Go back and look at it. Right? I, and, and let me tell 00:15:07 [Speaker Changed] You, oh, I don’t, just so you know. Yeah. I, I have a vivid recollection of chatting with Jim Bianco about this, and we were both bullish, but for completely different reasons. To me, anytime US equity markets are cut in half, I’m a buyer and people say 1929, I’m like, great, you gotta go back a century to find the exception that proves the rule. But Jim was early on in the Tina trade, Hey, the Fed has made everything cash, trash bonds are, they’re forcing you into equities, which is what led my post, which everybody stole the line. This is the most hated bull market in history. Yeah, yeah. And I, I wrote that up. I send that out and I heard everybody borrow that. But I’m curious as to where the June rally took you. Well, 00:15:55 [Speaker Changed] This, and this is where I’m going about the role of forward guidance in Jim Bianco’s point about, because what the Fed did wasn’t just it’s policies around interest rates, you know, they took them to zero. And that’s where we stayed, 00:16:16 [Speaker Changed] Started buying mortgage backs and they did 00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] Qe, balance, balance sheet operations. Right, right. 00:16:22 [Speaker Changed] Quantitative easing, 00:16:23 [Speaker Changed] Actual, you know, actually, and I look, I, I think QE one, I think it saved the world. This 00:16:28 [Speaker Changed] Is what, right. And what was that? A trillion dollars something crazy. 00:16:31 [Speaker Changed] Something. Yeah, something something. 00:16:32 [Speaker Changed] 800 billion, something 00:16:33 [Speaker Changed] Something like 800 billion 00:16:34 [Speaker Changed] Unthinkable number. 00:16:35 [Speaker Changed] So I, I think that, so those were specific actions took, but, but even if you, people often say things when they’re leaving office. So, so Bernanke’s last speech is valedictory address. 00:16:48 [Speaker Changed] Right. More honest than intended. 00:16:51 [Speaker Changed] Much more so, and you see this all the time, right? George Washington leaving office. 00:16:55 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say, I, 00:16:55 [Speaker Changed] I, I, Eisenhower Yeah. 00:16:57 [Speaker Changed] That’s a big, 00:16:57 [Speaker Changed] I mean, when, when, when, when freaking Eisenhower warns you against the defense industrial complex. You know, you might, you might. I’m just saying. No, I won’t listen. 00:17:06 [Speaker Changed] It’s general like to you. That’s 00:17:08 [Speaker Changed] Right. General, like to me, what Bernanke said when he is leaving his terms of office, he said, look, we had, we had two toolkits. One was traditional stuff, interest rates down to zero. At the time we didn’t know we could have negative interest rates. So, you know, that’s where we were. Right. Second were the balance sheet operations, large scale asset purchases, qe, quantitative easing. It said, you know, QE one was great. Did what we hoped it would do. QE two, eh, operation Twist, QE three, this is Bernanke saying, mind you. Yep. He says, I actually think that might have been a little counterproductive, 00:17:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh? 00:17:49 [Speaker Changed] They said, but we had another toolkit, and that was our communication policy. That was forward guidance, that we started using our words not to communicate to the market what we actually felt. We started using our words and coordinating our words to change the market, to change market behavior. This is what I mean about making a conscious effort to tell a story. And it, it’s not that it was necessarily lying, but they, they were using their words and choosing their words for effect 00:18:28 [Speaker Changed] To shape perception of their underlying 00:18:31 [Speaker Changed] Behavior to market, to, to shape market behavior. And he said, that worked better than we had any hope that it could. And that’s where we are now. 00:18:42 [Speaker Changed] So, so for the youngins listening, I have to point out, and you and I are old enough to remember back in the days where there were no minutes released there, there wasn’t an announcement, forget a press conference. You had to be watching the bond market to figure out what the Fed just did. Like today, there’s, we’re holding the, having this conversation. There was a fed the October meeting, a quarter point rate, cut a conversation about all sorts of stuff. I really didn’t pay a lot of attention to it. Yeah. Lack of clarity, no data, blah, blah, blah. 00:19:20 [Speaker Changed] Worse than that, Greenspan would be intentionally vague and obtuse. 00:19:25 [Speaker Changed] If you understood with you’re saying what I said then, then you misunders you misinterpreted it. Right? Exactly. 00:19:30 [Speaker Changed] Right. 00:19:30 [Speaker Changed] If you think you understand what I’m saying, 00:19:33 [Speaker Changed] You know, who led the committee to make all that change? Janet Yellen, she was vice chair. Yep. 00:19:39 [Speaker Changed] Back, back in, during the financial crisis. Yeah. 00:19:41 [Speaker Changed] So this was, it was a concerted effort. Bernanke Yellen to this is when they also started going, putting all the Fed Governors on a common calendar. 00:19:52 [Speaker Changed] Right? 00:19:53 [Speaker Changed] Follow all the, and assigning the fact, okay, you’re gonna speak this day, you’re gonna speak that day. That’s when all this started. It was an intentional effort. And again, this is something that politicians have known forever, right? Politicians craft the message and use their words. So I, I knew the, the tools to try to understand this, but what I wasn’t prepared for was how, and neither was Bernanke, was how powerful this would become to the point where today it’s not just central bankers using their words as their main policy toolkit, but it’s every CEO it’s every CEO Now, I mean, you go on this network or one of the other networks, and what makes for a good CEO is can you tell the story? Can you tell the narrative of your company to get a multiple, right? Because, because a multiple is a narrative. A multiple is a story. 00:20:52 [Speaker Changed] They’re 00:20:52 [Speaker Changed] All stories. Well look at, 00:20:53 [Speaker Changed] Look at some of the most successful CEOs throughout history. I would throw Jack Welch into that pile. ’cause he was a fabulous, fabulous. Yeah, he was a fabulous, fabulous. ’cause the stories he told were great, right? Up until the point where we found out that he was running a, a, a hedge fund with GE Capital, and they magically always beat by a penny. 00:21:17 [Speaker Changed] So I remember vividly when GE was coming to our shop, what they wanted was a fin a financial multiple, right? So they were making, they, they wanted, 00:21:33 [Speaker Changed] Even though they’re an old world industrial, 00:21:35 [Speaker Changed] Even though they’re an industrial, this, that this was, they wanted to tell a story that they should be seen as and get the multiple of a financial, that’s what GE was all about in those years leading up to the, the, the GFC. So a, my, my poster child for this is, is Mark Benioff Salesforce, because he’s pri you often see this with people who come out of sales like, like Mark did, right? But 00:22:08 [Speaker Changed] The way it’s all about storytelling. 00:22:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s all about storytelling. And 00:22:13 [Speaker Changed] What isn’t that true for go through the great, see, look, Steve Jobs, Reed Hastings, Larry Ellison at Oracle to some degree, Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, who wasn’t a great CEO, but he was a great cheerleader story, and a great storyteller, great 00:22:32 [Speaker Changed] Storyteller. What all of those companies have in common is that they’re great storytellers, and those are trillion dollar companies today. Right. What I would say to you is that you don’t remember or hear about the companies that did not have CEOs who are great storytellers. 00:22:51 [Speaker Changed] Well, Ken Lay was a great storyteller until you found out that it was all nonsense. And you could say the same thing about folks like Bernie Madoff. 00:23:00 [Speaker Changed] There are a lot of stories that get told that are not true. Right? What, and and I think even today, people think of this word narrative. They have a pejorative sense to it. It’s like, 00:23:15 [Speaker Changed] Oh, really? Really? That’s interesting. I didn’t think of it that 00:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Way. Oh, for, for, for, for for sure. That’s just your narrative, man. You know, the Big Lebowski, you know, that’s, that’s the, and it’s not that a story is a lie. It’s that the story is constructed for effect. It’s, it’s not, and it’s presented to you as if this is my true and inner thoughts, but the construction of the, the intentionality behind these stories, phenomenal. Benioff, for example, you know, created the metrics by which he wanted Salesforce to be judged. Not metrics of profitability, but metrics of what he called proforma, net revenue growth, whatever the hell that means. Right? Right. And because if you can construct the story, you can construct it in a way that, yes, I can beat and raise pretty much every quarter. So there was, there were three, I think, big changes that happened to make the role of narrative overwhelming as it is today. Whereas before, it’s always been there. To your point, it’s always been there today, it’s overwhelming. And, and I think it’s, it’s not just the success that first central bankers and then CEOs. I mean, wall Street’s the greatest copying machine. We Wall Street copies what works. Sure. So when you see that something’s working, oh, they’re, they’re getting a multiple by telling the story and going on Kramer, you know, four times a 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] Year. It’s endless. It’s endless iteration. You’re just constantly tweaking it, doing works. And if it works, do more of it. And if it doesn’t, toss it out. So 00:24:58 [Speaker Changed] It was the, the fact that it works to tell a story and people got good at telling stories. It’s the growth of 24 7. I’m gonna use air quotes here and I’m glad we’re taping this news. Well, 00:25:11 [Speaker Changed] It’s media, social media news right 00:25:13 [Speaker Changed] Now. 00:25:14 [Speaker Changed] News, like news light. 00:25:16 [Speaker Changed] That wasn’t the case. 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna I wanna annotate what you said slightly. Okay. Because I think CEOs have always been storytellers, but they were storytellers to their boards, to their employees, to their shareholders. Correct. They always, the, you’re hitting now on the modern world of 24 7. Media telling a story in a boardroom is very different than sitting in a TV studio and talking about, Hey, here’s why our new chip is gonna catch up to Nvidia. Yep. And it’s the greatest thing ever. Yep. That’s a different skillset. It 00:25:52 [Speaker Changed] It changes the time horizon. It is a very different skillset because you’re not telling the story of, oh, I’m getting another, you know, turn of leverage in our operations, or, you know, our capacity utilization in this factory went up by 5%. Which are the kind of stories you would tell even on earnings call or certainly to a board. Now, this is the story where got a 00:26:16 [Speaker Changed] Gotta gotta 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] A little bit. You, you’re, you’ve got a segment, you’re going on, Kramer, you got four you minutes and say bye bye bye. You got at most four minutes. Right? Right. How are you gonna tell that story that sings to that audience? Enormous change, change, structural change in our media, both quote unquote news media, but also financial news media. The Wall Street Journal today is a 24 7 news, financial news organization. Right. 00:26:47 [Speaker Changed] What, what isn’t It’s printed New York Times, Bloomberg, the Washington Post. Exactly. They all have websites that get updated around the clock. 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] And here’s the thing, there’s not enough hard news to fill the time or to fill the space. So what takes the space opinion 00:27:04 [Speaker Changed] Story you were channeling 00:27:05 [Speaker Changed] Story takes the place of 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] The hard, you were channeling Michael Creon from 25 years ago. Most of what you see in the media is speculation, opinion, and theory, not news. I, 00:27:18 [Speaker Changed] I’ve written so much about Creighton and his 00:27:21 [Speaker Changed] I know. That’s why I threw that back to 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] You. He says he, he was, he was so far ahead 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] This quarter century ahead of what, of what took place. 00:27:28 [Speaker Changed] And there’s a third piece though, 00:27:31 [Speaker Changed] Give us the third piece before we go to our next segment. Third 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Piece has changed. Everything is our smartphones 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] That you walking around with. Right? Not only a studio, but a, a a a, a dopamine device that you’re constantly playing. 00:27:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s my dopamine machine, right. And I, we do it to ourselves. It’s not that someone forces us to hear these stories over and over again. We do it to ourselves. I mean, I get a little nervous if I, you know, pat, where’s my phone? Where’s my phone? That’s right. That’s right. I, I get a little nervous. And it’s a, it’s, it is absolutely a neurotransmitter addiction. I think it’s so important to keep that from our kids. That’s a whole nother thing. 00:28:17 [Speaker Changed] There’s a whole depression situation with teenagers today, and it all traces back to the phone and social media. 00:28:22 [Speaker Changed] These are three, I think, real secular changes we’ve had. Markets become this political utility, the success of constructing a story, structural changes in social media, and the devices that we insist on caring with our ourselves all the time, 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Absolutely Fascinating. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Ben Hunt, president and co-founder of Perent, explaining how he’s using AI to identify narratives in real time. I’m Barry Ltz. You’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My special guest this week is Ben Hunt. He is a academic fund manager, risk manager, entrepreneur, tech startup person. He is currently co-founder and president at persent, which applies AI tools to map and measure market narratives in real time. It’s really more than market mar narratives. It’s politics, it’s economics, it’s markets. You cover a whole lot of stuff. A 00:29:51 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. So what we’re able to do today, and this is the crazy change in the world back from when I was doing this on microfiche back in 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] The 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] 1980s. Yeah, exactly. We get, we have access to everything that’s published publicly in the world. And there are a couple of big data aggregators, Dow Jones, one LexiNexis another, everything that gets published in the world, all these languages, it’s available to you. And it’s, it’s not cheap, but it’s not crazy expensive like it used to be. And it’s always getting cheaper. So we’re able to take everything in the world that gets published, all the newspapers, all the websites, all the transcripts, everything that’s published publicly, we can pull in and then we can process it, process it with really, it’s the same math that I was using 30 years ago. Nobody’s invented cold fusion here, 00:30:55 [Speaker Changed] But the software tools are faster, stronger, better, 00:30:59 [Speaker Changed] And infinite. So the, the, the calculations here are not particularly complicated, but you have to do them at enormous scale. 00:31:08 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s a ton of volume. So, 00:31:10 [Speaker Changed] I mean, it’s crazy. The, the, just the, the scale of 00:31:15 [Speaker Changed] The numbers. Petabytes, terabytes just crazy. 00:31:17 [Speaker Changed] I mean, yeah. In the last couple of months we’ve processed over 200 billion tokens. Billion, 00:31:25 [Speaker Changed] Right. And a token is how much 00:31:26 [Speaker Changed] A, a token is like a word or a phrase. Okay. And so that’s the kind of the unit that you talk about when you’re putting through, when you’re putting something through a linguistic calculator. So 200, which is, which is what all of the, the 00:31:41 [Speaker Changed] LLMs, 00:31:41 [Speaker Changed] All the LLMs are, they’re linguistic calculators. And so, you know, we’ve processed, you know, several hundred billion tokens. Again, it’s not complex, but it is at scale. And what, what we’re doing with that is we’re reading the world’s news to understand the world’s stories and narratives. And you’re right, it’s, it’s much bigger than, or it’s much more focused that we have much higher resolution than just saying, oh, I’m bullish on financials. I mean, that’s a, that’s a narrative. Sure. Right. 00:32:20 [Speaker Changed] But 00:32:21 [Speaker Changed] There are 20 different variations of that. You’re, you’re bullish on financials. Why? 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] So wait, let me, let me, you, 00:32:28 [Speaker Changed] And we can track all those, we can track all those stories and how they wax and wane over time. That’s really cool. So 00:32:32 [Speaker Changed] Let, really cool me roll back to, I want you to explain what Perent is. Who are the clients? I don’t mean names, but No, sorry. What type of of clients do you have and, and what do they do with Persian’s output? 00:32:47 [Speaker Changed] So we started Persent in 2018. My partner from, we were at a, a asset manager spun out there to take the, the technology that I’ve been working on for years and, and really been writing about with Epsilon theory. So we started that in 2018 to do the, the basic research into processing enormous amounts of financial news data and to track the stories and how they rise and fall and wax and wane over time. Is that, that was, that was the story. That was the 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] Goal. So I, I love that description because there are a lot of trades going on where the storyline changes on a regular basis. Probably the Mac daddy of that is crypto first. It’s, Hey, you know, there’s fiat currency, this is outside of the system, it’s defi, then it’s a hedge for deflation, then it’s a hedge for inflation. Now it’s scarcity and, 00:33:51 [Speaker Changed] And digital gold. Right? Digital 00:33:53 [Speaker Changed] Gold. 00:33:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s, there are no fundamentals, right? With, with, with crypto. And I people will say there are, but there aren’t. Right? It’s, it’s driven by the waxing and waning of stories. And do, do they find purchase? Do they or do they kind of, people get tired of them? 00:34:11 [Speaker Changed] Well, they got tired of the defi story. And then once JP Morgan and BlackRock started creating, like, the Ibit is the fastest ETF to a hundred billion dollars. And so the old story of Defi is gone. And the new story is, oh no, this is an asset class at Wall Street’s embracing. That’s why you have to own it. 00:34:32 [Speaker Changed] That story, that story was, and very, that was a very similar story by the way, or a transition story from physical gold to GLD when that ETF came out. Right. Which was a very similar pattern because once it became a Wall Street, a, a table at the Wall Street Casino, right? Then it takes on a different meaning specifically around gold. Gold changed from being, okay, something that you bury in your backyard or you’re having your vault, you know, along with ammo and seeds for when the, the, the hard times come 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Bottled water, right? Bottled meals ready to eat, right, gold and lead. It 00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] Becomes a security. And its meaning changes from that, you know, apocalyptic bottled water. Right? And the meaning of gold today is as an insurance policy, a security against central bank error or government error. That’s the meaning of gold today. 00:35:35 [Speaker Changed] And is that the dominant narrative that you’re identifying as gold rallied over through 4,000? Ab 00:35:41 [Speaker Changed] Ab Absolutely. So, I mean, we’ve really been able to track that one in 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Specifically. So, so here’s the really big, here’s the million dollar or trillion dollar question. How do you identify a narrative and say, oh, gold is gonna double from here based on this narrative? Or, or are we not there yet? 00:36:00 [Speaker Changed] No, you, you identify the narratives. ’cause the narrative, the stories don’t ever change, right? So the, the story that leave gold aside for a while, think about you we’re talking about your bullish on company X, Y, Z because there are about, I don’t know, depending on how, again, how finely you want to resolve that. There are only about a dozen stories for why you’re bullish on something, right? They can be management change, top line growth, opportunity consolidation in the industry, 00:36:35 [Speaker Changed] Upcoming catalyst, 00:36:36 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so every catalyst story, new 00:36:38 [Speaker Changed] Products, new product, FDA’s gonna prove the new mo, new drug, new molecule. 00:36:43 [Speaker Changed] So that story, you just change the name. That’s the same story that’s repeated over and over again about any pharma or, or, or biotech company. The stories, we think that they’re amorphous and variable. The fact is that the, the core of the story, what we call the semantic signature, the meaning of a story, they’re amazingly constant over time. So what we’re looking for is for, and it’s, it could be dormant for a long time, but what you want to know is when that story starts picking up again, when someone starts playing that story, when it appears on Kramer and starts happening in the financial press, that’s the stuff we can pick up with real precision. So it’s both the stories that are starting to fade, 00:37:41 [Speaker Changed] But, 00:37:42 [Speaker Changed] But the, I think the really interesting stories are the stories that have been dormant for a long time and they start picking up again, 00:37:48 [Speaker Changed] You, you are reminding me of Campbell’s hero’s journey, that there’s only so many 00:37:54 [Speaker Changed] My hero, right? There are only so many stories Right. In the, in, in the world. And that, that’s a now I like to talk about in Hollywood, famously there are only like five scripts. 00:38:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. Right? 00:38:10 [Speaker Changed] Tolstoy is supposedly Tolstoy. He said there were only two stories that a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. Those are the only two stories in the world. And 00:38:20 [Speaker Changed] Not quite, but he’s, he’s 00:38:21 [Speaker Changed] Not quite but you on, he’s pretty close. You’re on the right track. 00:38:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? Right. The 00:38:24 [Speaker Changed] The point is, there’s a finite number of stories, right? You can drill down. So you can get a couple of dozen about any sector you want to talk about or like, but it’s, it’s a finite number. And so what we do, and what I think is really interesting is to track that finite number of stories. And you’re right, it’s not just around markets. We track several thousand of these stories today. 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] How so? Let’s, let’s delve into that. Yeah. So, so how do you, you have this massive database you’re sucking in every news feed. Yep. Everything magazine, newspaper, everything. Anything that you could quantify and, and run into a linguistics model. What’s the process for analyzing this? How to use artificial intelligence to, to go through this, and how do you make sense out of that heap of how do you find signal amidst all that noise? 00:39:23 [Speaker Changed] The crucial thing is you can’t just ask AI an open-ended question. Say, what are the narratives in Right? This comp for this company or for this sector? Don’t do that. Right? And this is a mistake that people make all the time. They ask open-ended questions of chat, GPT or or or whoever. The problem is chat, GPT will give you an answer. 00:39:45 [Speaker Changed] Just not a good one. 00:39:47 [Speaker Changed] Not a good one. It’ll hallucinate a lot. Yeah. Right. It’ll go out, it’ll find its own data. The, the secret to to using AI successfully is to take this magic genie because it’s a magic genie and you stuff it into that bottle, right? You do not let it out. You constrain it dramatically. You don’t let it go out and find data. You give it the data crucial thing. You don’t allow it to think. You tell it how to think. So the, the most important step that we do is we don’t ask ai what are the narratives that you look at? We tell it this is human direction. You have to have human control. 00:40:31 [Speaker Changed] So I’m hearing dataset is controlled by you as well as the thinking prompts. The seman. 00:40:39 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And it’s more than prompt, right? So the, it it, it includes prompt. But the, the phrase that’s used in this world is called not prompt engineering, but context engineering. 00:40:53 [Speaker Changed] Okay. That makes sense. 00:40:54 [Speaker Changed] So you want to, you want to control everything around the ai because you want to limit it to being that linguistic calculator. You want it to be your operating system. That’s really the way, the thing. And, and if you do that, then it will give you the same answer twice for the same inputs and the same question. That’s the crucial thing. So it’s 00:41:18 [Speaker Changed] Consistent 00:41:18 [Speaker Changed] For this to be true for, for it to be consistent, for it to be real signal. So this is a human directed process. You can’t ask AI an open-ended question. You have to control all the inputs. You have to control the output, meaning you judge it, you run it back through a different AI system to say, how’d they do? Did they go off the rails here? But the most important thing is you have to give it the scaffolding. You have to give it the, the skeleton. You have to tell it. These are the thoughts you are allowed to think about. You know what, and those are the, those are the, the signatures. 00:41:53 [Speaker Changed] I, I’ve kind of learned, I have to avoid asking questions that have a, a, a human emotional subtext. Like, tell me what was most surprising about this? Doesn’t know what a surprise is. Tell me what was most interesting about this. It does, it’s not able to do that. You really have to treat it like it’s a dumb machine. 00:42:18 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s right. This is why, I mean, you treat it, you, you need to treat it as an operating system. You need to constrain every bit about it, particularly in how you allow it to think because it wants to please you so badly, right? It does. So if you ask it, what’s interesting, it will look back at its history of communication with you, and it’ll think, what will Barry find interesting? And it will give that answer to you. And if it can’t find it easily, it’ll make it up. It’ll make up an answer that you will find interesting. 00:42:48 [Speaker Changed] I, I find when I, I, I try and prompt, Hey, tell me about Ben Hunt’s background and gimme the timeline of his career that it’s good at. Hey, what was Ben Hunt really good at? It has, has got no idea. 00:43:04 [Speaker Changed] So what, what you’re able to do, if you’re able to, again, put the genie in the bottle, tell it how to think about a problem, is you’re able to identify, and this does go back to the work from 35 years ago, the type of stories we tell that we humans tell the, the about stocks or politics. We tell two types of stories. We tell descriptive stories. Oh, the, you know, the fed cut rates by 25 basis points today. A descriptive story. But, and we can also tell the description of the, you know, 00:43:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s the because clause, because we’re seeing slowing increasing layoffs and slowing consumer terms. 00:43:53 [Speaker Changed] And, and that’s high resolution and dec and, and very descriptive, right? The, the Powell was surprisingly hawkish today. And he was, that’s a description. There’s another type of story we tell Barry. And that’s prescriptive, 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Meaning, 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Meaning the Fed should be hawkish. The Fed should cut by 25 basis points. Those are the stories that are indicative of an effort being made to move public opinion in a certain direction. 00:44:33 That’s like the forward guidance that the Fed still does, right? Using their words for effect. They’re using words to nudge you and how you should think about the world, how to think about the world. So the crucial thing when we’re doing these, when we’re asking the AI to here’s, here’s all the text in the world, here are the stories that we want you to identify. We can also boil that down into identify the stories that are trying to tell the reader how they should think or how policy should go that we find has a lot of predictive capability to it. 00:45:18 [Speaker Changed] So you are in the business of analyzing the world’s narratives every day. How is that even possible? It seems like that is an impossible 00:45:29 [Speaker Changed] Test. That’s seem crazy. 00:45:30 [Speaker Changed] Crazy, right? 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and it used to be, it used to be crazy. I, I mean, Barry, I I really do remember my, in the academic days, I would literally hire grad students and give them a cup of dimes. So they go down to the microfiche machine. 00:45:46 [Speaker Changed] I remember those machines in the library. You 00:45:47 [Speaker Changed] Remember those 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Machines? Yes. 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Yes. You remember those machines? I would code, hand code the, or hand record the coded data. I would type it into remote access for a digital equipment mini frame. And the next day, you know, something would churn out for me. Right? Today it’s, I say we are, we’re processing hundreds of billions of tokens. We get millions of documents overnight like that. 00:46:16 [Speaker Changed] Is there there 00:46:17 [Speaker Changed] Any, is there infinite computing resources available to us? I, 00:46:20 [Speaker Changed] Is there anything you can’t access that you wish you had access to any data source? 00:46:28 [Speaker Changed] So one of the things that’s happened on Wall Street is that the banks and the sell side have become very jealous of their publications because they tend to think in their wrong that they’re good at it. Right? They’re that they’re good at analysis. I personally don’t think they are. Well, 00:46:49 [Speaker Changed] Let, let’s just say some are better than others. Some 00:46:52 [Speaker Changed] Are better than others, but, but none of ’em are really, if if they were, if there was, I’ll call it kind of significant alpha there, they wouldn’t be a bank. 00:47:04 [Speaker Changed] They’d be a hedge fund. 00:47:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They wouldn’t be a ba on the, on the sell side. Now, so I’m interested in reading the sell side research, not because I think there’s some nugget of truth in there, but because I wanna see what they’re all talking about, 00:47:17 [Speaker Changed] Right? It’s reflective of, if not a consensus. Yeah. Certainly a a popular set of ideas. 00:47:24 [Speaker Changed] And, and this is a crucial thing to talk about what we do. I I don’t know what the truth is, right? I have 00:47:31 [Speaker Changed] No idea. Does it matter? 00:47:32 [Speaker Changed] And I don’t think it matters. I I want to provide this information to people who do have a view on the truth. Let’s say you’re a, you’re a value investor, right? You’re running a fund, you’ve got your views, you’ve done a, your homework, you’ve done your research, 00:47:47 [Speaker Changed] You’ve got a good back test. Yeah. 00:47:49 [Speaker Changed] You, yeah, yeah. You’ve got, so I’d say I’ve got, here are the companies where I think I’ve identified something special, something that’s valuable that the market does not recognize. And so I wanna buy it, and then I’m just gonna wait. I gotta wait until one day the market realizes the market comes to their senses and says, oh, wow, that should trade at a higher multiple or a higher price. Because that special thing that you saw, that source of value, the rest of the world comes to see that. Well, what I can think I can show you is when the rest of the world starts to wake up to whatever it is you’re looking for. 00:48:31 [Speaker Changed] So you’re catching the early lift off the bottom. That’s the 00:48:35 [Speaker Changed] Goal. I see. When the, when, when a value investment only works, when the market recognizes it. And we are tracking when something like that gets discovered by the market. 00:48:46 [Speaker Changed] So before Nvidia is 5 trillion, when it, when it starts ramping up to 500 billion, hey, something’s going on here. 00:48:57 [Speaker Changed] What I have found in my experience as an investor is that you make the most money on a trade during what I call the discovery phase of a trade. When the rest of the world wakes up to something that you had noticed and identified before, that’s when the money is made. Once it gets out there, 00:49:19 [Speaker Changed] Then it’s reflect then the, the market be ev is eventually efficient. 00:49:23 [Speaker Changed] It’s a different, it is a different risk and reward profile. Let me, let me put it that way. Fair. You, you, you get, you get a lot more ups and downs post that discovery phase than you do when you’re enjoying the discovery phase. It’s a lot harder. Once you have the, now you may say, oh, but there’s gonna be this other catalyst. And then say, well, 00:49:45 [Speaker Changed] But that, that discovery phase is, I’m gonna quote Doug, Cass, that’s the, there’s a phrase he uses it, it’s like a, a contrarian perspective. A variant perspective where a perspective, you have some insight that is not widely held. Right. And the market being mostly kind of sorta of eventually efficient if there’s a truth or at least a good story in your variant perspective, all 00:50:15 [Speaker Changed] It is a story, right? All it takes is a story. It’s 00:50:17 [Speaker Changed] Gotta be a good story though. Yeah. 00:50:19 [Speaker Changed] It’s gotta be a, well, I’ll call it, it’s gotta be a compelling story, right? Right. And that’s, that’s why you are looking for a CEO who can tell that compelling story. You’re looking for the ability to tell a compelling story, because that is what gives you a multiple. So let me multiple is story. 00:50:37 [Speaker Changed] So let me ask you a few more questions on, on Perent before we go into a few other areas. Sure. So first, you, you’ve been doing this for seven years. What are you doing today? That was unimaginable 4, 5, 6, 7 years ago. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] I, I tell you something that was unimaginable really two years ago. That’s amazing. And that is the ai. So what we were doing in our early days, we were basically doing small language models. We were making the language models essentially by hand. And, you know, we did our first models and our first versions of this, and we licensed it to some big banks. And here’s the problem, Barry. We, we had constructed a net and it was a pretty good net. I mean, when we would dip it into a data stream, we’d catch a fish meaning a signal. And the signal, oh, that, that signal works. You know, good, good. Hit on the, the signal that we put up. The problem was we were missing too many damn fish, right? Our, our net was too small. And we’d say, oh, we got this one. And then we’d look back at whatever it was. 00:51:46 We were designing the model. So we say, well, how did we miss all these other fish? And the answer was the small language model we were constructing. It’s incredibly complex if you are building these models without the probabilistic approach that modern LLMs allow you to take, right? So this is the whole notion of embedding. So that there are a million ways to say I’m bullish about the management change at company X, Y, Z. There are a million ways you can say that. And if you’re in the business as we were of kind of handcrafting, let’s write down all the ways you can say that. Oh, really? You miss a lot. Yeah. You’ve made a small net and what you’re trying to, to, to, 00:52:33 [Speaker Changed] And a and a small data set, and it’s 00:52:35 [Speaker Changed] A pretty small data set. So we, we rebuilt all of our software, again, using AI as an operating system context, engineering control, how you dole out the text data, how you test it, how you allow it to think. And we thought, all right, you know what? We’re building a bigger net. I bet we see five, maybe even six x improvement in our signal 00:53:05 [Speaker Changed] Catching. And what did you end up with over 00:53:06 [Speaker Changed] A hundred x? 00:53:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s unbelievable. 00:53:08 [Speaker Changed] Over a hundred x, it’s over. And now it’s, we’ve had a multiple of that. Again, it’s, it’s, it is hard to describe in, in the, in the, the expansion of the net is in so many different directions. Everything we were doing before was just English language, 00:53:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? So now you’re global and how many languages are you pulling into the, 00:53:29 [Speaker Changed] Anything, anything that an AI has been trained on, we read it and we can say we can, 00:53:35 [Speaker Changed] Is that 40 languages? Is that like how many languages? Well, there 00:53:38 [Speaker Changed] Are only a, you know, there are about a dozen languages that are useful in markets. So 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] It’ll be Japanese, Chinese, a variety of European languages. So 00:53:47 [Speaker Changed] We can, we can 00:53:48 [Speaker Changed] Tell Indian, 00:53:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s the, here’s a story here. The story about Chinese domestic markets. There’s a western story, western narrative, 00:53:57 [Speaker Changed] And there’s a domestic Chinese story. And the domestic 00:53:59 [Speaker Changed] Chinese story, 00:54:00 [Speaker Changed] Which is very different. 00:54:01 [Speaker Changed] Often it’s very different. So we were able, for example, picking up, we were able to pick up way before it, it, it got picked up in Western press. The demand for luxury goods in China went off a cliff. 00:54:19 [Speaker Changed] Cliff, yeah. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] In last November. 00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] Listen, you can’t go from a double digit GDP to like, low to mid single digits and not have it affect, especially in a country like that. Well, 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] And, and, but, but it’s interesting, right? Because, because they’ve had, you know, ups and downs on business cycle before, but this is the first time where you saw consumer behavior that really was kind of similar to what you might find in a Western consumer behavior point being you didn’t hear that from LVMH or the Macau gaming guys until February. And we were picking that up in, in, in November from the domestic Chinese media. 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so that raises a, a really interesting question. You know, at the end of the day, clients want to be able to make money on your research. How are people putting this to work? How, how does what you are building help your clients generate alpha? 00:55:15 [Speaker Changed] What we think we’ve discovered is an entirely new source of data. And what we’re confident is that we’ve built the systems that are very different from what you see with this sort of analytics that are out there from anyone else. Right? So this is not sentiment, right? We’re not tracking or using mean words or nice words. By 00:55:37 [Speaker Changed] The way, that was a big thing, I dunno, was that 10 years ago we’re s we’re scanning Twitter to identify investor sentiment. Oh 00:55:44 [Speaker Changed] My god. I mean I, but I was just looking today and not to pick on Bloomberg, but you know, it was their live coverage of the Fed statement, right? Were at those meeting, they were analyzing the sentences and the fed statement for hawkish and dovish sentiment, 00:56:02 [Speaker Changed] How it changed from the last meeting. And, 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] And 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so so you’re saying there’s not a whole lot of signal there. 00:56:08 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. I wanna be careful with what I say, right? Which is that there are a number of, I’ll call ’em high frequency stat arb guys, where if it’s important for you to note the difference in word choice on a millisecond level, I think there, I think you can get something outta that. I do. And so there are firms that can do that very well. That’s not our game, right? This is not the, what we’re trying to, to identify is not just sentiment, not just word choice. This is not Google trends and how many times did they mention AI in the earnings report, right? There’s, we’re able to track the actual stories that drive behavior. 00:56:54 [Speaker Changed] So that, that’s the next question. And, and I’m gonna give Dave not a credit for asking this. Does every narrative turn into a decision? How do you know when something is merely noisy versus where there’s a, a significant tradable signal? 00:57:14 [Speaker Changed] I don’t. Right. So this is, my goal is not to, oh, you know, do the trades. My goal is Mr. Hedge fund guy, Mr. Asset, allocator, you’ve got a, you know China, right? You know your companies, you know your commodities. Here is data that I think you’ll find useful. The efficacy of it though is up to you. I don’t know what you would, what, what you wanna do with it. I want to sell the picks and shovels honestly for this vast new data set that we all know is important. But we haven’t been able to measure it in a very predictive way before. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about a few things related to that. Can I say one more 00:58:02 [Speaker Changed] Thing? Sure. And it’s not just about using this for investment. So we have a product for financial advisors, right? Which is your clients coming in, you’ve got a portfolio. You need to be able to say, what, what is, what is my client? What, what are they worried about? What are they nervous about? What are they hopeful for? What are the stories they’re reading? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] And you are pulling this out of the flow of media and 00:58:29 [Speaker Changed] We can tell you exactly for of, for the portfolio you’ve got for that client, here’s what they’re gonna be asking about, worried about. And here are the answers you can give them to show this is when has happened before, when this story has come up. Stay the course, it’s gonna be fine. This is the sort of stuff we can do for financial advisors. Huh. 00:58:46 [Speaker Changed] That’s really interesting. I would, I would love to see some of that. It’s not just 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] In markets. Barry, I gotta tell you, the 00:58:53 [Speaker Changed] Policy makers, corporate executives, bankers, 00:58:56 [Speaker Changed] Policy. So we did a, you know, we did before in the run up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we published this on Epsilon Theory. And this is my old academic work, right? The book Getting to War before a country starts a war, they mobilize public opinion, right? And so we were looking at domestic Russian media looking at and saying, friends, this isn’t gonna li be a limited thing. 00:59:22 [Speaker Changed] This is happening. 00:59:23 [Speaker Changed] This is happening. It’s gonna be a full scale invasion. Because that was the messaging in domestic Russian media to the Russian people. 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] Wow. 00:59:32 [Speaker Changed] So brands, right? So you are, you know, we’re working with some, some it sounds, but pro sports teams, you want to tell a story to 00:59:44 [Speaker Changed] Your fan 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] Base, build a stadium, 00:59:46 [Speaker Changed] Sell some tickets to sell some 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Stadium. Yeah. Sell tickets, build a stadium, gimme some examples of people who have told good stories and how did that work for them? How can we do the same thing? So let’s, 00:59:56 [Speaker Changed] Let’s just start looking 00:59:57 [Speaker Changed] At storytelling. 00:59:58 [Speaker Changed] If Jeff Bezos was a subscriber to this back when he was trying to build a tax funded HQ on the Hudson, had he had your data and you were crunching all the New York City news stories about this, might you have been able to give him advice that he 01:00:19 [Speaker Changed] Suffered? A percent 01:00:20 [Speaker Changed] Suffered such a backlash. Because you 01:00:22 [Speaker Changed] Know what we have today? We have polls. Right? Right. Because, 01:00:24 [Speaker Changed] Which are terrible, 01:00:26 [Speaker Changed] Terrible, terrible. Right. Which are mostly terrible now, you know, and, and I love the poly market stuff and other things where you try to get as many people as possible to put money on something. Right? 01:00:34 [Speaker Changed] So, you know, when you ask a person a question, you’re asking them, Hey, what do you think you think? And what do you think you’re gonna do in the future when we know people are terrible at both of those things? 01:00:45 [Speaker Changed] Terrible at both of those things. 01:00:45 [Speaker Changed] But if you put a little money on it, alright, maybe they might be a little more circumspect that, 01:00:50 [Speaker Changed] That, that helped. That helps a ton. So, so in places where you can have a make a bet, I think that improves the kind of information you can get. It still lends itself to a lot of manipulation. Sure. And a lot of, 01:01:02 [Speaker Changed] They’re not issues around it, poly markets and cashie and all those things. It’s not the bond market. It’s not a hundred and something trillion dollars. It’s a couple of bucks on each of these. And sometimes that’s right, a million dollars moves a half a million dollars can move a market. 01:01:17 [Speaker Changed] But for a lot of things, let’s say you’re polling for a political candidate, right? You can’t ask them to put money down on something. Right? Right. You, but, but you really wanna know the, these, these policies that my candidate is thinking about taking on, is that popular? Does it resonate? Is it a compelling story? We can absolutely see if that is true by looking at local media, local social media, all of that. So it’s, it’s pretty wild there. I mean, once you start looking at how important stories are and once you’ve got a tool where you can actually measure them and visualize them, it’s like, it’s like, I feel like it was like when they invented whoever was Lovin Hook or whoever invented the microscope when you’re actually to see something that we all know is there, 01:02:05 [Speaker Changed] Well now we do back then. Right? Like remember germ theory took what a century to catch on it. 01:02:10 [Speaker Changed] It took a century. Yeah. And it takes, it takes seeing it, right? It takes the instrument to actually measure it before you actually believe in it. And so I, I, I feel like that’s kind of where we are right now. It’s these early days. But to actually see and measure the storytelling at this level of resolution, this magnification is pretty freaking cool. 01:02:29 [Speaker Changed] So, so we’re having this conversation with market at all time highs, and you’ve written about the ravine. Yep. Tell us a little bit about what is the ravine, how does, does your data identify that? Tell us what this means. 01:02:46 [Speaker Changed] Well there’s, there’s, there’s clearly been a change in policy regime out of, of Washington and 01:02:53 [Speaker Changed] New administration, and a radically different, 01:02:56 [Speaker Changed] Radically different 01:02:57 [Speaker Changed] Approach, even from the first Trump presidency, 01:02:59 [Speaker Changed] Even from the, the, the first presidency. And so what we’re able to, to measure, really measure is how does that, I’ll say play, but also what comes, narratives never happen in a vacuum. There’s always a counter story. For every bull story, there’s a bear story. And they, they, they, you can almost kind of see the battlefield of ideas, the battlefield of stories and how it emerges. So my strong sense, Barry, is that we are going towards politically in this country towards trench warfare, greater and greater, I’ll call it narrative violence. And it, if you look historically how that plays out in countries, it doesn’t, it doesn’t play out well. 01:03:56 [Speaker Changed] Civil war, domestic political violence, things like that. 01:04:01 [Speaker Changed] Sadly. Yes. Exactly like that. Exactly like that. So there’s that element. And so that’s a, that’s a sad one, you know, or a, a very troubling one and trying to, well, how do we navigate that? But even when in, in markets, and I alluded to this earlier, how capital markets have become a political utility and the, the role of markets in our society, you can really see how that changes in the stories we tell ourselves about the role of markets, what it’s there for. And I 01:04:38 [Speaker Changed] End of day options and speculation, what else is it supposed to be there for? 01:04:43 [Speaker Changed] But that, but that’s kind of what I’m getting at, Gary, right? You, you can see an enormous change in the meaning of markets. And it connects with a, yes, they’ll call it the speculation layer, but it also connects with financial nihilism, yolo, it, it, it leads to a very, I think, less attractive future for how we think about money and the role of markets and the role of capitalism 01:05:20 [Speaker Changed] Coming up. We continue our conversation with Ben Hunts, president and co-founder of persuent, discussing how money managers use their output to generate alpha. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest today is Ben Hunt. He is president and co-founder of Persuent, a data analytics narrative, storytelling, large language model, using artificial intelligence to find some signal amongst the noise firm. Their clients range everything from large money managers to hedge funds to academics and corporate America. So you write Epsilon Theory and some of it is for subscribers. Some of it is public. A lot of 01:06:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s public. Yeah. 01:06:36 [Speaker Changed] One of the things you wrote is absolutely my favorite item from the first few months of the Trump presidency because I like to talk in probabilities. ’cause I don’t know what’s gonna happen. Yep. But here’s the best case scenario. Here’s the worst case. Here’s all the middle scenarios. You wrote a piece, the end of Pax Americana that I thought was the most cogent, imaginative, well thought out. Hey, here’s the worst case scenario, and we are becoming dangerously flirting with this possible outcome. And I use that as all right, so here’s what I think is high probability. Yep. Here’s the best case. But if you really want to think about how this can go off the rails, check out what Ben wrote. And so tell us a little bit about how did Perent inform the end of Pax Americana? Because I, I get the sense that domestically that wasn’t really where a lot, what, how a lot of people were thinking. But I got the sense from overseas that was a much more common thought. Tell, tell us a little bit about both the piece and, and how the data informed it. 01:07:55 [Speaker Changed] I’ll start with the, I’ll call it the, the international dimension. I wanna come back to the domestic dimension because I, I think we’ve got some really interesting data recently to, to, to share. It goes back to this, yeah. Again, I, I cringe what I was talking about, but, but, but it is, it is game theory, right? And all game theory is, is strategic interaction. It’s that the, the United States, yes. Is the most powerful player on the world stage, but every country has some degrees of freedom and some autonomy in their, in the policies that they, that, that they implement this. There is not a dominant strategy, meaning an outcome. An equilibrium outcome. Again, I hate using these words, but I’ll use them anyway. All an equilibrium means is, it’s a balancing point where both parties, let’s call ’em the United States and a European country, where do they end up? Where they all say, okay, I can live with this, where I can live with this and the America first set of policies, and it’s all these set of policies. What you end up with is less potential economic growth, trade, all all of these things, 01:09:12 [Speaker Changed] All the things that we enjoyed post World War ii, that realignment, that imbued to our benefits so greatly, 01:09:20 [Speaker Changed] Enormously to our, to our, to our, to our advantage. Our advantage, yeah. Enormously to our advantage. It, it goes by the name of a soft power and you know, the dollar system, the bread, Bretton wood system, all of this 01:09:30 [Speaker Changed] Reserve currency on and off 01:09:32 [Speaker Changed] The reserve currency to finance our deficit. All of this is enormously to our advantage. And yes, there are free riders on that system. Yes, there are cost to that, particularly on defense and some other, some other areas. Tariffs are in other area where there’s absolutely free riders on that. So there’s improvement that can be made in that system, for sure. Right. But this is not, this is a different system. This is a different set of rules of the road. And it leads to a different strategic interaction between, between countries. So that’s what the note was about. And it’s, it’s, I’m not trying to predict, I’m just, I’m just trying to observe that. And which is a great line actually by George Soros, which is, you know, I’m, I’m not predicting, I’m observing, which I love that as a line I’m not. And our technology is not there to try to predict the future is trying to tell you what is true in the present today. 01:10:30 [Speaker Changed] I, I’m amazed how many people think they can forecast the future when they have no idea what’s happening. Right. I 01:10:36 [Speaker Changed] Wanna, I want to now cast what I want do. That’s exactly, yeah. Not, not forecast. I want to now cast. And that gets the, I wanted to talk about kind of domestic. So we started tracking the different narratives around immigration policy early last year and what you saw in some of the kind of simp 01:10:59 [Speaker Changed] This is during the run up to the election. 01:11:01 [Speaker Changed] Yes, exactly. And what you saw, and really going back, ’cause we can take, we take this stuff back for a decade or more. And what you absolutely saw up to last October, there’s a, there was an event from last October, not the election, but an event from last October. You see a steady increase in, regardless of your political affiliation. You know what immigration isn’t working for us isn’t as, as Americans saw a steady increase starting with the, they’re eating the, the cats. 01:11:37 [Speaker Changed] They’re eating the cats, they’re eating their dogs. They’re 01:11:40 [Speaker Changed] Eating the dogs. When you saw one, the, the Columbus mo when you, that, that moment, 01:11:45 [Speaker Changed] One of the most, that’s where things, the real moments in debate history. 01:11:49 [Speaker Changed] And we see very clearly in our media data, and this is, this is not mainstream media. This is everything that we’re pulling up. We’ve seen an, a really significant decline in the volume and density of, oh my God, immigration is a problem. We need mass deportations. On the contrary, we’ve seen an enormous increase, again, regardless of political affiliation, including Republicans. No, immigration is a good thing for this country. Huh? This is the stories of America that are pro-immigrant and immigration. Now, you would not believe that if you were looking at the policies that the White House has implemented during these first, you know, 10 months of the administration. 01:12:38 [Speaker Changed] So, wait, when did you first notice that? Regardless of policy, we think immigration is a net benefit to America. When did that first start showing up? 01:12:49 [Speaker Changed] It started changing right? In October because it, following 01:12:52 [Speaker Changed] The dogs, 01:12:53 [Speaker Changed] Cats, it was too far. It was, it was like, this is just silly stupid. This is silly and stupid. And it’s been a steady increase. You know? And you wouldn’t, you wouldn’t believe that if you were I immersed in Twitter stuff. But, but, 01:13:06 [Speaker Changed] So this 01:13:07 [Speaker Changed] Is, our country is actually quite pro-immigrant. I know that sounds cr 01:13:13 [Speaker Changed] But we are a nation of immigrants here. Here’s another data point that’s kind of mind blowing. We were talking about a different data point in, in the entirety of the US history, 2025 looks like the first year where the US population will decrease. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it’s a decrease in legal immigrants. Not, not only illegal immigrants, but legal immigrants. Add that with the deportations and just people staying away. 01:13:41 [Speaker Changed] Well, this, this gets back to the, the, the economic picture and from other, so what, what you’ve had is a clear, and again, we, we, we see this in our data from other countries. There’s a clear effort to repatriate assets and funds away from the us. There’s been a clear effort outside the us You see this with central banks, but also with 01:14:03 [Speaker Changed] Cor hence gold. The big and gold. Gold. Correct. 01:14:07 [Speaker Changed] Treasuries used to be a safe haven asset. Right? 01:14:11 [Speaker Changed] No 01:14:11 [Speaker Changed] More. That’s, that’s, it’s, it’s, 01:14:13 [Speaker Changed] Do you understand how significant that charge is? That you’re making, you’re basic, enormous, basically accusing the president, well, of submarining one of the single greatest assets America halts. Well, 01:14:26 [Speaker Changed] That it’s a, it is built up to such a, an extent, right? That the way I think of this is an iceberg that is melting, but it is melting. What we do not see, we do not see capital flight. 01:14:40 [Speaker Changed] Right? We, we saw it for like a week in April, and then that was quickly 01:14:44 [Speaker Changed] Reversed. That was it. So there’s, there, there is, there’s no capital flight there, there are no, 01:14:47 [Speaker Changed] But there was some fear US 01:14:48 [Speaker Changed] Investors that leaving the country that there were fears, and we can track it. If that starts to happen, we’ll see it immediately. That’s not happening. Repatriation continues to happen. 01:15:00 [Speaker Changed] Slowly measured, balanced, 01:15:01 [Speaker Changed] Melting iceberg. Right? Because there are limits to, if you’re a Bermuda reinsurer, I mean, you’re kind of, you’re, you’re stuck with treasuries, right? Right. I mean that, that 01:15:11 [Speaker Changed] You’re, you could buy some gold to offset it, but you can’t sell a hundred billion dollars worth of treasuries. No, you 01:15:16 [Speaker Changed] Can’t. You can’t. So it’s a melting iceberg. But we can clearly see that the dog is not barking yet and maybe never will is capital flight. What we see in politically domestically is that actually, and this was validated by a Gallup poll they’ve been doing 20 years, which also showed what we had saw, started seeing a lot earlier where immigration as a thing is actually pretty darn popular in the United States. 01:15:47 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. But so are, so is restricting assault rifles and we can’t get any change on that. I that’s 75, 80% or the actual 01:15:57 [Speaker Changed] Large. I, I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you that depends very much in how that question is asked. 01:16:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s true for all polling. Well, 01:16:04 [Speaker Changed] This is the benefit of what I’m trying. So, so when, when we’re doing these seman, we call the semantic signatures, it has nothing to do with how you’re phrasing the question. We’re not doing polling. We’re seeing what people are actually the meaning of what they’re talking about in, in media. 01:16:20 [Speaker Changed] So how does that play out if people are legitimately saying no immigration is a good thing for America. Is there an impact on population and the economy? Is there an impact on markets? Is there an impact on policy and politics? 01:16:35 [Speaker Changed] I think there’s an impact on the election, the midterms next year. 01:16:40 [Speaker Changed] So we’re talking, we’re talking literally 12 months from now. 01:16:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. ’cause that’s how this, the stuff gets ca on the political front narratives and opinions. They get cashed out in elections. Right. Mark are different. You, you cash stuff out every day. The right, the market’s 01:16:59 [Speaker Changed] Open every day. The feedback loop is so rapid with markets. 01:17:02 [Speaker Changed] Ex Exactly. Politics is a different story. So Right. It gets cashed out in the elections. 01:17:08 [Speaker Changed] If you were to ask me before this conversation, what’s the most significant impact on the midterm elections? There was just a Gallup poll yesterday, GOP questions on the economy. They were plus 14% two years ago. They’re minus 4% this year. Yeah, I, 01:17:26 [Speaker Changed] I saw that. 01:17:27 [Speaker Changed] And, and that’s an amazing swing. And I’m, I’m saying to myself, you know, listen, the out of power party usually picks up, you know, 10, 15 seats. Yeah. You have the redistricting question, which may blunt that. But if, if the most important question during the election was on the economy, and that’s an 18% swing, this is looking like a pretty substantial shift. What I’m hearing from you is, hey, this isn’t just about the economy. 01:17:55 [Speaker Changed] It’s not, 01:17:56 [Speaker Changed] It’s not what, so it’s the economy, it’s immigration. What else? What else are you seeing? That’s interesting. That’s 01:18:01 [Speaker Changed] It. That’s, that’s pretty. Now there are other aspects though, where the, the stories, it, this is, this is people talking about immigration as a thing. Now, whether, now whether that gets translated into a political party position. ’cause I gotta tell you, the Democratic party I is enormous enough. But there, there are no, there are no narratives that are being put forward by the Democrats that are powerful. Or, or, or, or popular. So I 01:18:31 [Speaker Changed] I I don’t, other than the mayoral contest in New York. Yeah, 01:18:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:18:35 [Speaker Changed] Right. That what I, that’s this 01:18:36 [Speaker Changed] One. What I’m saying is that the, is that the many of the policies that are being presented by this administration are unpopular, not just with the Democrats, but with Republicans. And increasingly so immigration being one of them. I think economy being another one, 01:18:58 [Speaker Changed] Tariffs aren’t really popular amongst, but people perceive that as a tax increase or, or a pressure on small business 01:19:07 [Speaker Changed] Government shut down. Right? So both also not popular. And also in this, it, it’s, it’s that ’cause the, the question, oh, well, the Democrats will get blamed. Well, that’s not really true. That’s not what’s happening now. How that all 01:19:19 [Speaker Changed] Pay, pay and by the out and listeners should know. It is a long way off. You are not a hard, you’re not a Democrat. Oh my 01:19:25 [Speaker Changed] God. No. 01:19:26 [Speaker Changed] Like, like I know you and your politics and the stuff you’re saying, I, I could hear people shrugging and saying, oh, that Ben Hunt is just a liberal Democrat. I’m like, no, no, no. That’s not who Ben is. 01:19:37 [Speaker Changed] No, no, it’s not. 01:19:39 [Speaker Changed] You are just talking about here’s what I see in the data. 01:19:42 [Speaker Changed] I’m saying I’m observing. I don’t, I’m observing. And I think that a lot of times, if we are like me very online and on Twitter too much, right? You, 01:19:53 You don’t see the broader picture of what is happening on blog posts and local newspapers and, and, and everything else. So I think having the ability to read everything and track these stories that, you know, they don’t, they, they, like I say, they wax and wane, but they don’t, they don’t ever go away. The, it’s, it’s, it’s something we’re very excited about to track the stories of America. I’ll, I’ll give you another one. And this one actually, I don’t know what to do with this. One of the stories of America is that America has raised the world’s wealth, right? That, that that 01:20:48 [Speaker Changed] Global standard of living, 01:20:49 [Speaker Changed] Global standard of living, that, that America has been this powerful force to, and, and capitalism and America have been this powerful force to raise people outta poverty. That’s a story that in other periods of time has been out, has been prominently talked 01:21:08 [Speaker Changed] About. Very resonant. 01:21:09 [Speaker Changed] That story is non-existent today. 01:21:11 [Speaker Changed] Well, you cut things like HIVA few million dollars to inoculate all of Africa from HIV. That’s gonna have repercussions. 01:21:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, it, it’s, it’s not just that, that that has the con those those repercussions that you’re describing. Right. What I’m saying is that the story that would support that, it’s gone. 01:21:37 [Speaker Changed] Is it gone forever? Has no, has 01:21:39 [Speaker Changed] No, that’s, these things are never gone. These stories, stories have, they never die. Right? They’re, they’re, they’re waiting for a new force to give them life. 01:21:49 [Speaker Changed] The next version of it, if us is not seen as a force for raising people out of poverty around the world, do people see China as that force? 01:22:00 [Speaker Changed] Haven’t looked at that. We’ve been looking at the, the US store. But I, but I I, my my personal sense is, is that we’ve essentially seeded the field 01:22:09 [Speaker Changed] CEDD with a C not 01:22:10 [Speaker Changed] An S Yeah. With a C. Not in s particularly in South Asia and Africa to, to, to China. I, I mean, that, that seems, that seems pretty, 01:22:20 [Speaker Changed] You know, pretty clear. This is, I’m glad I asked the question about the end of Pax Americana. ’cause I, I, I’ve just found that piece so insightful and so useful, and I could keep you here talking about this stuff for hours. But out of deference and respect for our listeners’ time, I’m gonna jump to our favorite questions that I ask. Oh, sure, sure. All of our cl all of our guests. But before I do, there’s a question that I, I have to pose to you, which is, so you get to see things before they sort of bubble up into the mainstream before they become a well understood narrative. What’s a narrative that you are just starting to sniff out? That most of the world, or most of the country, or most of Wall Street and finance hasn’t seen yet? 01:23:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s a story that people are talking about since tricolor and first brands went out, 01:23:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? The, the, 01:23:24 [Speaker Changed] So it’s the story on, on credit, story of credit, and 01:23:29 [Speaker Changed] I mean, first brands is legitimate. It sounds like felonies were happening there. So we’ll have to see what, how that plays out. I 01:23:37 [Speaker Changed] Probably try color as, as as well. But my point is that every day you have a new bank, CEO come out and say, no, no, everything’s fine. Right? So yesterday it was David Solomon at Goldman Sachs saying, no, no, it’s fine. Today I was hearing the Brookfield guy saying, no, no, it’s fine. For every story, every interview, the guy says it’s fine. You’re getting two articles in the ft or the journal saying ain’t fine. So 01:24:09 [Speaker Changed] The, you think thou death protested too much. Is it that 01:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m, I am I, all I’m saying is I am observing. I’m not predicting, I am observing the level of volume for Hmm. Alternative asset managers, their exposure to private credit. This is problematic. Oh, I’m wondering what’s gonna happen when the music stops. Oh, I think that these, this blows back into the commercial banking system. Those stories, those narratives are higher by an order of magnitude than they’ve been at any point in the last 10 years. Hmm. At any point, including during COVID during when you had similar concerns over, oh my god, private credits. 01:24:51 [Speaker Changed] I was easy to rationalize everything. Hey, listen, we’re all frozen. Just ignore it. 01:24:55 [Speaker Changed] But I, this is a story that has legs. It is growing in a way that I rarely see. And once a story like this grows, it doesn’t just go away. And it’s not fixed by Bernanke saying, oh, subprime is contained. Right. 01:25:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s immediately what I thought of as soon as you 01:25:15 [Speaker Changed] Mentioned it. Absolutely. It does not get fixed by people saying, don’t worry, there’s no problem. 01:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Jim Grant said he was right. It was contained to Earth. Yes. Yes. The rest of the solar system was fine. Which turned out to be a very witty and clever observation. This 01:25:31 [Speaker Changed] Story, this worry, this concern absolutely has legs. And we’re seeing no signs of it easing off in financial media and press. So 01:25:43 [Speaker Changed] The, the big question is, is it systemic? Or I don’t, is it the specific, like 01:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I say, I, I don’t know the truth, right? I don’t know reality. All I can tell you is 01:25:55 [Speaker Changed] We’re seeing more of this. 01:25:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, we’re seeing this is, this is the story. 01:25:59 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Let, let’s jump to our favorite questions, starting with who are your mentors who helped shape your career? 01:26:09 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s good. Well, I, you know, I mentioned that the people both in undergrad and graduate school, who turned to me on to the science part of political science. And in particular in graduate school, Gary King, who runs the whole social science research center up there at Harvard and has for a long time now. He wrote the original, really the book on inference. You hear about inference all the time now. 01:26:34 [Speaker Changed] Well, Cialdini, of course. 01:26:36 [Speaker Changed] So the, the notion of inference taking large data sets and pulling out, 01:26:41 [Speaker Changed] Oh, inference. I thought you said influence. No, no, no, no. Inference. Inference. 01:26:46 [Speaker Changed] So the science of inference, the, I learned that from Gary, you know, 30 years ago. And it’s so interesting to see that come full circle because that’s at the core of, you know, Jensen Wong’s always talking about it and the whole notion of AI to that inference spend. They talk about, I was there at the beginning for how you, what inference is and why it is so powerful. That was a huge influence on me. 01:27:14 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are you reading now? What are some of your favorites? 01:27:19 [Speaker Changed] I’m a science fiction guy. 01:27:21 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I really am. You’re talking to another sci-fi guy. So let’s, so I I I give us something new and something classic. Well, 01:27:27 [Speaker Changed] Something classic would be Lu Hin and the Three Body Problem. Right. 01:27:32 [Speaker Changed] By the way, the Netflix show on that was surprisingly watchable. 01:27:36 [Speaker Changed] I thought it was excellent before that. And you know, I named the company after him was the Foundation Trilogy 01:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Asimov with 01:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Asimov. Those books hold up Less well, honestly. And I thought the, the series was, it had its moments. I 01:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t love the series. Yeah. 01:27:51 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was so pretty soso to me. Current science fiction. Rebecca goes, she goes by RF kwong and she wrote a book called Babel, and she’s got a new one out two B or 01:28:07 [Speaker Changed] One BBAB. 01:28:08 [Speaker Changed] Like Tower of Babel. Right. B-A-B-E-L. And she’s got a new one out Caba I think it is, but science fiction dealing with language and linguistics. I love that stuff. 01:28:19 [Speaker Changed] That, that, I love that stuff. That sounds like that’s right in your, your sweet spot. Let’s talk about streaming. What are you watching or listening today? Podcasts or Netflix or whatever? So, 01:28:29 [Speaker Changed] Honestly, I don’t listen to any podcasts. Isn’t that terrible to admit? 01:28:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, if you host, I will say this. If you host a podcast, you’re either preparing for a podcast Yeah. Doing a podcast or ordering a podcast. Alright. Right. So it’s like, all right. That’s three or four. 01:28:43 [Speaker Changed] That’s all it is. Yeah. 01:28:44 [Speaker Changed] Right. Every now and then I’ll, I’ll catch something. ’cause I wanna either listen to this, a specific guest, like IWI will not listen to any podcasts that you are on before we do our podcast. Right. ’cause I don’t wanna steal anybody else’s Yeah. Or narrative or questions or line of thinking. So I, that’s purposeful. But every now and then, so I listen to, the things I listen to are like John Pirelli’s Radio Deluxe. Yeah, yeah. Which is sort of like a podcast slash music series. Something 01:29:17 [Speaker Changed] A little different. Yeah, exactly Right. What, 01:29:20 [Speaker Changed] What about streaming? What are you watching? Well, 01:29:22 [Speaker Changed] You, you and I are both Big Godfather fans. So we love all the, the mobster. I Have you seen Mob Land yet? With, with No. Alright. Worth your time. Okay. Pierce Brosnan eats up every scene. Tom Hardy is awfully good. I just love him in anything. If you, I don’t know if you ever saw Peaky Blinders, right. Started as a modern 01:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Version of Pinky Blinders. I started, I kind of fall, so couldn’t get into it. So my issue is I have to watch something that my wife tolerates. Like I have, I have friends 01:29:49 [Speaker Changed] That’s a struggle 01:29:50 [Speaker Changed] Who, like, he goes into this room, she goes into that room, they don’t watch anything together. Like, I don’t know how that works. Like it’s, she’ll watch some stuff without me. I will watch some stuff without her. Right. 01:30:02 [Speaker Changed] You gotta have your own space. 01:30:02 [Speaker Changed] But 80% of what we watch, so I have fallen that’s hard down the British upstairs. Downstairs Gilded Age. Yeah. So we watched The Crown, we watched the Gilded Age. We finally, let 01:30:15 [Speaker Changed] Me give you one, lemme lemme 01:30:16 [Speaker Changed] Give you one. We went back to Downton Abbey, which I missed when I first rolled out. 01:30:20 [Speaker Changed] Check out. So my guilty pleasure, and I do watch this with my wife, is a diplomat. 01:30:25 [Speaker Changed] Ju the new series, just the new season just dropped new season. Yeah. And that’s teed up for this weekend. I’m looking forward to that. Excellent. That the first, was this season two or season three? The first season was great. 01:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:30:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I’m gonna give you, if you like that. So my wife finds these really interest. She got me into Killing Eve, which was a little more spy fair than diplomacy. And if you get a chance to watch Slow Horses, oh, 01:30:52 [Speaker Changed] That’s the one I’ve gotta see. Yeah. 01:30:54 [Speaker Changed] It’s really, that’s the one. So the first season is great and people have told me the most recent season, it, it, some people will say, I don’t like the second kinds in the middle. I, I know people who loved it all the way through. But it’s, it’s really, it, it’s really an interesting well told beautiful cast. Just fantastic. Yeah. You’ll, you’ll love that. Our final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give a recent college grad interested in either investing or working with large language models, working with narrative analysis and artificial intelligence? Hmm. 01:31:35 [Speaker Changed] Don’t, and I, I say that tongue in cheek. I I, 01:31:41 [Speaker Changed] You had a lot of fits and starts going back seven, eight years 01:31:44 [Speaker Changed] For, for sure. And I, I tell you what I, I think’s I important you have to, what, what you, what I think you can accomplish in academia, either in grad school or whatever it is, is you build your intellectual capital. And so I think a lot of times when you get out of college, you say, okay, I’m just ready to kind of live my life and start something. And you haven’t built that intellectual capital yet. The the issue is though, is that once you enter, particularly the investment world where particularly if you’re responsible for managing other people’s money, brother, that’s it. Right? I mean, you’re, you’re, there’s, there’s not, you’ve, that’s got to be your, your total focus. You are spending your intellectual capital, you’re not gaining intellectual capital once you take on a role like that. So I, my first advice is find a a path where, and that’s often in, in, in academia where you’re building intellectual capital. Because once you leave that environment, 01:33:02 [Speaker Changed] Then you’re spending it down. 01:33:03 [Speaker Changed] You’re spending it down. 01:33:05 [Speaker Changed] Makes sense. You’re spending it down. Our, our final question. What do you know about the world of, fill in the blank in investing data analytics? Narrative storytelling today would’ve been helpful 25, 30 years ago 01:33:22 [Speaker Changed] In investing. I wish, I wish I had understood the role of, lemme step back a second. I, I think that whether you’re talking about data or whether you’re talking about investing, and I’ll speak for myself, but I think there are a lot of people like me. We think there’s an answer with a capital A right there in the, in the numbers. And if you just look hard enough, and if you work hard enough, you’ll find that answer. Right? You’ll find the secret, the secret formula. 01:34:00 [Speaker Changed] And you have learned since then, 01:34:03 [Speaker Changed] Ain’t no such thing. Right now, there is magic and there are patterns, but it’s, it’s, it’s not in the structured data, it’s not in the numbers, it’s actually in the error. It’s in the probabilities, it’s in, we’re calling, you know, the stochastic element, right? The, the, the role of chance and understanding that there are patterns and there’s real magic in understanding that I didn’t get that when I was either starting with data analysis or with investing. I was looking for the answer with a capital A as opposed to a process with a capital 01:34:43 [Speaker Changed] PII love that answer because, so my exercise in confirmation bias is I love the fact that you looking back, we all have the benefit of hindsight. Yeah. And unfortunately, that can be a bias to certain people. But when you’re looking back at it, you know how it happens at the moment when you don’t know what the outcome is, thinking about it, probabilistically is a much healthier approach than saying, here’s a binary up or down, yes or no. And I’m either right or wrong, and I see people struggle with that constantly, 01:35:21 [Speaker Changed] Constantly. When I first started in the investing world, again late, I got two pieces of good advice, right? One was never go all in. Right? 01:35:31 Which is, which is really interesting because it’s this, this business of investing. It’s a wonderful life. You were solving puzzles, we meet interesting people. We get to have these sort of conversations. It’s a, it’s a career for a lifetime. And the two pieces of advice are really, it never go all in. And also, reputation is absolutely the most important thing. And again, especially when you’re young, you think, oh, well that’s not the most important thing. You know, being right’s the most important thing. It ain’t, it’s playing the long game here, which you want to, it’s never go all in. And the reput reputation 01:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Is never go all in by never go in. You mean never put everything at risk so that if it doesn’t work out, you’re, you’re outta the game. You’re done, you’re out. 01:36:25 [Speaker Changed] Stay in the 01:36:25 [Speaker Changed] Game was the Gerald Loeb’s book, the Battle for Investment Survival? Stay 01:36:29 [Speaker Changed] In the Game, avoid that risk of ruin You, you, you just, or don’t ever risk ruin. 01:36:36 [Speaker Changed] That makes sense, right? 01:36:37 [Speaker Changed] Because once 01:36:37 [Speaker Changed] You, people don’t think in those terms, but that’s really, they don’t, they don’t all in means risk of ruin. 01:36:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s the risk of ruin. And it also connects with reputation because once you, 01:36:50 [Speaker Changed] Once you blow up, it’s tough to go back 01:36:53 [Speaker Changed] And you start saying, oh, I can fix it by taking this shortcut or doing this other thing. Right? And once you do that never ends Well, it never ends well. Right? And you tell yourself, oh, just this one time. It’s never this one time, 01:37:07 [Speaker Changed] Ben, this has been absolutely delightful. I’m so glad we’ve finally me too gone around to doing this. I, I I’m just entranced by your thought process. Some of the things like, I love reading stuff of yours that I totally disagree with. And then ’cause it forces me to say, well, he’s not just making this up. I know how you, your brain works. And it’s like, all right, if Ben is saying this, then I’m gonna make this my worst case than I’m, ’cause it’s easy to dismiss it. Everybody gets out seeking, confirming information and rather than being dismissive of it, alright, you claim to think probabilistically, where does this fit into the range of probabilities? And once you start thinking in those terms, it’s like, oh. So the worst case scenario is worse than my worst case scenario. I gotta move the bottom of my range down further. ’cause if this goes off the rails, this is really bad. That’s what your Pax Americana piece did with me. Well, thank you. And it really, it really helped me figure out how to think about, especially in that week between April 2nd and ninth, where everyone was losing their mind. It’s like, oh no. So they’re losing their mind. ’cause hey, this could happen. But maybe something good comes out of it. Trying 01:38:26 [Speaker Changed] To avoid tunnel vision. I think it’s so important in our business or any business, but especially our 01:38:31 [Speaker Changed] Business. In our business in particular. Well, thank you for being so generous with your time.

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 13 2026 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Archival Storage, a data storage and protection solution designed for managed service providers and their small to medium-sized business customers. Pitched as offering long-term, compliant and cost-efficient data storage and protection, Acronis Archival Storage allows users to retain large amounts of data securely, affordably and with fast accessibility when it matters most. Acronis Archival Storage has been built for compliance-driven and data-heavy environments and allows users to store infrequently accessed data with Amazon Web Services Inc. S3-compatible object storage, integrated directly into Acronis’ unified billing and management system. The company says the solution offers the reliability, durability and predictable pricing model MSPs need to meet customer demands and long-term retention requirements. “For many customers, regulations and industry best practices require data to be retained for years,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “With Acronis Archival Storage, MSPs can now provide their clients with long-term storage built for compliance readiness, cost predictability and ease of use.” Key features and benefits include S3-compatible object storage integrated with Acronis’ unified billing and management system to allow MSPs to manage archival data alongside other services from a single platform. The service delivers millisecond-level data retrieval with 11×9 durability and 99.5% availability, complemented with built-in encryption and write-once, read-many immutability that helps ensure data integrity and support regulatory compliance. The offering is designed to provide predictable total cost of ownership, with no egress or application programming interface fees to eliminate unexpected cloud charges and to complement existing warm backup storage in regulated environments. Acronis Archival Storage also emphasizes ease of deployment and ongoing management through preconfigured plans, S3 API support and integrated controls and is supported by seven globally distributed data centers to improve connectivity and meet regional compliance requirements. For MSPs, Acronis says, the new solution represents a new way to differentiate their offerings and build predictable margins through integrated billing and zero egress costs. By combining archival capabilities with Acronis’ robust cyber protection ecosystem, it says, service providers can deliver end-to-end data management that scales across customer needs, now with a cold storage tier. Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Davos to begin new era with global order shaken by Trump
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0113/1552872-davos-begins-new-era-with-global-order-shaken-by-trump/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T12:56:44Z
Full Content:
Business and political elites head to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week with its vision of a rules-based global economic order being tested to the limits. US President Donald Trump's expected appearance in the Swiss mountain resort highlights the gap between his agenda and the consensus-driven approach of the WEF, which has faced enduring criticism that it is a talking shop of the rich. His "America First" policy has led to trade tariffs being used as punishment, military intervention in Venezuela, the threat of taking over Greenland by force and a US retreat from cooperation on climate, health and other global challenges. The Trump administration has also threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment, prompting many top central bankers to issue a statement defending him and central bank independence. Dubbing its 56th edition "A Spirit of Dialogue", the WEF's leaders say that given the current uncertainty, getting together to map out a way forward in business and politics is crucial. "Dialogue is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said WEF president and CEO Borge Brende, a former Norwegian minister. But others say that with the US and China leveraging power to suit national interests, the WEF risks obsolescence. "Who is going to be making the case for the rules-based international order?" said Daniel Woker, a former Swiss ambassador and foreign relations expert. "To be very blunt, in a system where everyone is only looking out for themselves, it has no reason to exist. It's an event from the past." Davos-watchers are also looking at whether the event has lost impetus since its 87-year-old founder Klaus Schwab stepped down as chair in April. The Geneva-based organisation said in August an internal investigation had found no evidence of material wrongdoing by Schwab, after a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. It named BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs. The latest forum has much to discuss, from how to handle Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine establishing US supremacy in the Western hemisphere, to the ways artificial intelligence is changing the world. It comes just after one of Switzerland's worst modern tragedies, a ski resort bar fire that killed 40 people. In pre-event briefings, the WEF has put a brave face on the global tumult, highlighting how companies have sought to adapt to the highest U.S. tariff rates since the Great Depression and pointing to an easing of trade tensions in late 2025. Still, a WEF survey of executives released last week showed that doing business got harder in 2025. The poll also painted a downbeat picture of cooperation on peace and security. With several European leaders expected to attend, eyes will be on how they respond to US challenges, including Trump's threats to take over Greenland, and attacks on European efforts to regulate American tech firms. "The politicians need to stand strong," said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of the UNI Global Union representing 20 million service-sector workers worldwide, urging policymakers to address how AI and new technologies impact jobs. One feature of this year's WEF meeting will be top oil executives eager to hear Trump promoting his energy dominance agenda, which encourages them to drill for more oil and gas while snubbing alternatives like wind and solar. The CEOs of Exxon Mobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor and ENI are all expected after much more sporadic attendance in past years, when oil players saw the forum as anti-fossil fuel. It remains to be seen whether China, which in recent years has sent top officials, will field a sizeable Davos presence. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026.

LAST UPDATE | 13 Jan IRISH DIPLOMATS HAVE postponed an accreditation ceremony for the new Iranian ambassador to Ireland in response to the deaths of pro-democracy protestors. Iran has an embassy in Blackrock in Dublin and its new chief diplomat, Eshagh Al Habib, was due to go to Áras an Uachtaráin for a ceremony to accept his credentials. This has been postponed, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, in response to the deaths and injuries of people killed in protests and the shutting down of the internet and phones in the country by the regime. Speaking to reporters in Egypt today during a tour of the Middle East, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee said she didn’t think “it was appropriate” for the ceremony to proceed today. “We’re appalled and I’m appalled by what’s happening in Iran, and I don’t think it was appropriate for that to proceed today,” she said. “We need to keep diplomatic ties open, and we will, but I think it was the right thing to do today.” Iran has been gripped by pro-democracy protests in recent weeks – hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in the uprising against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s rule. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher. The protests in Iran began in late December over the ailing economy and have transformed into the most significant challenge to the regime for several years. McEntee said today there is a small Irish team on the ground in Iran. “We’re engaged with them on a regular basis,” she said, adding that contact between the team and the Department of Foreign Affairs is “very difficult” due to communications restrictions in Iran. “I don’t fear for their safety, but we do need to keep in contact with them,” she said. Advertisement Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin condemned the regime’s attacks on protestors and said the violence in Iran “must stop”. “I strongly condemn the brutal and violent suppression of protestors that has left hundreds of civilians dead in Iran over recent days,” he said in a statement on X. “The people of Iran have a fundamental right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. The repression must end. I urge the authorities in Tehran to uphold the rights of all their citizens. “The violence must stop, the curtailing of basic freedoms must end, and dialogue begin at once.” On Sunday, McEntee said she was “deeply concerned” by developments in Iran. This morning the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the postponement of the formal ceremony to welcome the new ambassador. “The decision to postpone the ceremony of credentials for the Ambassador-designate of the Islamic Republic of Iran was taken in light of protests in Iran in recent days which have seen very significant numbers of Iranians killed or injured and a communications blackout,” a spokeswoman said. In a statement yesterday, the Iranian regime’s embassy in Dublin has claimed the Tehran Government is open to dialogue, committed to human rights and “peaceful assembly”. The Journal has requested a statement from the Iranian embassy in regard to today’s development. UK Diplomatic measures have also been taken in the UK, with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper telling the House of Commons today that her department had summoned the Iranian ambassador. Cooper said she had spoken to the Iranian foreign minister yesterday, “setting out the UK’s total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing”. The Foreign Secretary said: “Today, as the further reports have come through, the minister for the Middle East (Hamish Falconer) at my instruction has summoned the Iranian ambassador to underline the gravity of this moment, and to call Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing.” With additional reporting from Eimer McAuley Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo LONDON, Jan 13 : BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, still believes in the investment case for artificial intelligence in the year ahead but will be focusing on broader opportunities, it said on Tuesday. Investors seeking to play the AI theme into 2026 favour energy and infrastructure providers over Wall Street big tech, BlackRock said in its Investment Directions report, citing a recent investor survey it conducted. AI and big tech dominated markets and world equity returns in 2025, but as the multitrillion-dollar race between the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres generates worries about uncertain returns on capital and higher borrowing, investors were looking for new ideas, the BlackRock survey showed. Among the 732 companies in BlackRock's survey of clients based in the EMEA region, only a fifth said that the largest U.S. tech groups represented the most compelling investment opportunity in AI.

Layoffs in 2026: At least three large companies have announced mass layoffs in the recent days, and January is not even over yet. The job loss trend that gripped 2025 seems to have entered 2026 too — at least for now — with giants like Meta, Citi Group and BlackRock laying off thousands of staff across roles. The BlackRock layoffs were the most recent job cuts announced by a major company in this month, with the firm announcing that it will let go hundreds of employees. Here is a list of major companies across the world that have announced layoffs in 2026 — Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in the company's Reality Labs sector as it plans to restructure to put more money into AI, Bloomberg reported. As per the report quoting a person familiar with the development, the Meta job cuts are expected later this week as the company wants to shift money away from some virtual reality products and into other AI wearables. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg had asked company executives to look for budget reductions within the Reality Labs. Banking major Citigroup is about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company. The Wall Street bank had around 227,000 employees at the end of September as per data shared by it. The latest round of layoffs at Citigroup comes as part of the company's plan announced two years ago to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, as per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know. “We will continue to reduce our headcount in 2026,” Citigroup said in a statement. “These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work,” it added. Under Fraser, who took over as CEO in 2021, Citigroup has seen a company-wide revamp where it exited much of its international retail business and restructured its core operations. BlackRock on Monday said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, becoming the latest Wall Street firm to announce job cuts. As per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know, the BlackRock layoffs will see around 1% of its workforce being let go, translating to around 250 employees across divisions. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority. Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future,” a BlackRock spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. The move comes as the CEO of the world's largest asset management company pushes for alternative investments.

Title: Ethereum’s hidden ‘death spiral’ mechanic could freeze $800 billion in assets regardless of their safety rating

The Bank of Italy warns of systemic risk as Ethereum's collapsing price could pave the way for network hijacking and asset manipulation. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. An Ethereum price collapse could break the blockchain’s ability to settle transactions and freeze over $800 billion in assets, a Bank of Italy research paper warns. The paper, authored by Claudia Biancotti of the central bank’s Directorate General for Information Technology, outlined a contagion scenario where ETH's price collapse degrades the blockchain’s security infrastructure to the point of failure. Such a breakdown, the report argues, would trap and compromise tokenized stocks, bonds, and stablecoins that major financial institutions are increasingly placing on public ledgers. Essentially, the paper challenges the assumption that regulated assets issued on public blockchains are insulated from the volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency. According to the report, the reliability of the settlement layer in permissionless networks like Ethereum is inextricably tied to the market value of an unbacked token. The paper's core argument rests on the fundamental difference between traditional financial market infrastructure and permissionless blockchains. In traditional finance, settlement systems are operated by regulated entities with formal oversight, capital requirements, and central bank backstops. These entities are paid in fiat currency to ensure trades are finalized legally and technically. In contrast, the Ethereum network relies on a decentralized workforce of “validators”. These are independent operators who verify and finalize transactions. However, they are not legally mandated to serve the financial system. So, they are motivated by profit. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Validators incur real-world costs for hardware, internet connectivity, and cybersecurity. Yet, their revenue is denominated primarily in ETH. The paper notes that even if staking yields remain stable in token terms, a “substantial and persistent” drop in the dollar price of ETH could obliterate the real-world value of those earnings. If the revenue generated by validating transactions falls below the cost of running the equipment, rational operators will shut down. The paper describes a potential “downward price spiral accompanied by persistent negative expectations,” where stakers rush to sell their holdings to avoid further losses. Selling staked ETH requires “unstaking,” which effectively deactivates a validator. The report warns that in an extreme limit scenario, “no validators means that the network does not work anymore.” Under these conditions, the settlement layer would effectively cease to function, leaving users able to submit transactions that are never processed. So, assets residing on the chain would become “immovable,” regardless of their off-chain creditworthiness. Meanwhile, this threat extends beyond a simple halt in processing. The paper argues that a price collapse would drastically lower the cost for malicious actors to hijack the network. This vulnerability is framed through the concept of the “economic security budget,” defined as the minimum investment required to acquire enough stake to mount a sustained attack on the network. On Ethereum, controlling more than 50% of the active validation power enables an attacker to manipulate the consensus mechanism. This situation would enable double-spending and the censorship of specific transactions. As of September 2025, the paper estimates Ethereum’s economic security budget was approximately 17 million ETH, or roughly $71 billion. Under normal market conditions, the author notes, this high cost makes an attack “extremely unlikely.” However, the security budget is not static; it fluctuates with the token's market price. If ETH’s price collapses, the dollar cost to corrupt the network falls in tandem. Simultaneously, as honest validators exit the market to cut losses, the total pool of active stake shrinks, further lowering the threshold for an attacker to gain majority control. The paper outlines a perverse inverse relationship: As the value of the network’s native token approaches zero, the cost of attacking the infrastructure plummets, yet the incentive to attack it may increase due to the presence of other valuable assets. This dynamic poses a specific risk to the “real-world” assets (RWAs) and stablecoins that have proliferated on the Ethereum network. As of late 2025, Ethereum hosted more than 1.7 million assets with a total capitalization exceeding $800 billion. This figure included roughly $140 billion in combined market capitalization for the two largest dollar-backed stablecoins. In a scenario where ETH has lost nearly all its value, the token itself would be of little interest to a sophisticated attacker. However, the infrastructure would still house billions of dollars in tokenized treasury bills, corporate bonds, and fiat-backed stablecoins. The report argues these assets would become the primary targets. If an attacker gains control of the weakened chain, they could theoretically double-spend these tokens by sending them to an exchange to be sold for fiat while simultaneously sending them to a different wallet on-chain. This brings the shock directly into the traditional financial system. If issuers, broker-dealers, or funds are legally bound to redeem these tokenized assets at face value, but the on-chain ownership records are compromised or manipulated, the financial stress transfers from the crypto market to real-world balance sheets. Considering this, the paper warns that the damage would not be confined to speculative crypto traders, “especially if issuers were legally bound to reimburse them at face value.” JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. In conventional financial crises, panic often triggers a “flight to safety,” in which participants shift capital from distressed to stable venues. However, such a migration may be impossible during a collapse of blockchain infrastructure. For an investor holding a tokenized asset on a failing Ethereum network, a flight to safety could mean moving that asset to another blockchain. Yet, that presents significant obstacles to this “switch in infrastructure.” First, cross-chain bridges, which are protocols used to move assets between blockchains, are notoriously vulnerable to hacks and may not scale to handle a mass exodus during a panic. These bridges could come under attack, and further rising uncertainty could cause assets to be “speculated against,” potentially causing “weaker stablecoins” to de-peg. Second, the ecosystem's decentralized nature makes coordination difficult. Unlike a centralized stock exchange that can halt trading to cool a panic, Ethereum is a global system with conflicting incentives. Third, a significant portion of assets may be trapped in DeFi protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, about $85 billion is locked in DeFi contracts at the time of writing, and many of these protocols act as automated asset managers with governance processes that cannot respond instantly to a settlement-layer failure. Furthermore, the paper highlights the lack of a “lender of last resort” in the crypto ecosystem. While Ethereum has built-in mechanisms to slow the speed of validator exits, capping processing to about 3,600 exits per day, these are technical throttles, not economic backstops. The author also dismissed the idea that deep-pocketed actors like exchanges could stabilize a crashing ETH price through “massive buys,” calling it “very unlikely to work” in a true crisis of confidence where the market might attack the rescue fund itself. The Bank of Italy paper ultimately frames this contagion risk as a pressing policy question: Should permissionless blockchains be treated as critical financial market infrastructure? The author notes that while some firms prefer permissioned blockchains run by authorized entities, the allure of public chains remains strong due to their reach and interoperability. The paper cites the BlackRock BUIDL fund, a tokenized money market fund available on Ethereum and Solana, as a prime example of early-stage traditional finance activity on public rails. However, the analysis suggests that importing this infrastructure comes with the unique risk that the “health of the settlement layer is tied to the market price of a speculative token.” Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. The paper concludes that central banks “cannot be expected” to prop up the price of privately issued native tokens simply to keep the settlement infrastructure secure. Instead, it suggests that regulators may need to impose strict business continuity requirements on issuers of backed assets. The most concrete proposal in the document calls for issuers to maintain off-chain databases of ownership and to designate a pre-selected “contingency chain.” This would theoretically allow porting assets to a new network if the underlying Ethereum layer fails.

Title: JPMorgan Backs Altice USA’s Refinancing of TPG, Goldman Debt

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. is lending Altice USA an additional roughly $1.1 billion to refinance debt before an early repayment penalty kicks in, a move that may sooth creditors still reeling from a bombshell antitrust lawsuit and controversial debt maneuver. JPMorgan is providing the funds so that Altice can refinance the loan — a $1 billion asset-backed facility it got from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Angelo Gordon in July — at par value, according to people familiar with the matter. The debt’s call protection period starts in the coming days, meaning Altice would have to pay a premium above par to refinance. Representatives for JPMorgan, TPG and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A representative for Altice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any efforts to preserve Altice’s cash are likely to appease creditors to the embattled telecommunications firm, which has struggled under a heavy debt load and has brought on advisers to evaluate its options. Its lenders have also been rocked by some of its recent moves. In November, the US unit of billionaire Patrick Drahi’s telecom empire sued creditors including Apollo Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC and BlackRock Financial Management Inc., alleging they had formed an “illegal cartel” when they struck a so-called cooperation agreement. That same month, Altice — which recently rebranded as Optimum Communications Inc. — raised $2 billion from JPMorgan for the early refinancing of a loan due in 2028. While that loan carried some of the strictest investor safeguards in the company’s capital structure, the borrowing was raised with collateral that had been removed from existing creditors, effectively making JPMorgan more senior in the debt repayment line, Moody’s Ratings said in a report. The refinancing comes before a premium kicks in that could allow the lenders to capture as much as 116 cents on the dollar. The asset-backed facility due 2031 is secured by receivables generated by the company’s Bronx and Brooklyn service area and network assets, primarily the Hybrid-Fiber Coaxial network.

Title: Trump's feud with US Fed chair Powell rattles investors

Trump's fight with Federal Reserve Chair Powell just took a new twist — sending stocks and the dollar lower and lifting gold. DW looks into whether a new criminal investigation could put the Fed's independence at risk. Federal prosecutors in the United States have launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress on the $2.5 billion (€2.14 billion) renovation of the US central bank's headquarters in Washington, DC. Powell confirmed the probe Sunday in a statement posted on the social media platform X, hitting back at what he said was pressure from the Trump administration on interest rate policy. During US President Donald Trump's first term and since he returned to the White House one year ago, the pair have clashed repeatedly over interest rate decisions made by Powell The Fed chair has maintained that the central bank must set policy independently — guided by economic data rather than political pressure. Trump has grown increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Fed's decisions — notably in March, when the US central bank held interest rates steady. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that the Fed would be "MUCH better off CUTTING RATES." In April's so-called Liberation Day announcement, Trump said lower rates would help the US economy deal with his sweeping new import tariffs on goods from major trading partners. After calling Powell "stupid" and a "numbskull," Trump went further in July after the Fed still failed to cut rates, saying the policy was "hurting people." That month, Trump even visited the Fed’s headquarters — the first such trip by a sitting president in decades — which was widely seen as expressing his dissatisfaction with Powell. Trump also moved against other senior Fed figures, including Governor Lisa Cook, whom he sought to remove over unrelated allegations. The subsequent litigation is awaiting a hearing in the US Supreme Court. By midyear, US media outlets reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had emerged as a front-runner to replace Powell when his term ends in May. He has since downplayed his candidacy. Other reports suggested that the Trump administration was sounding out a wider list of possible successors. More recently, US media outlets have focused on four candidates: longtime Trump loyalist Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. By the end of 2025, Trump said he would announce Powell's successor in January. The growing speculation underscored how much pressure the chairman was facing well before the criminal investigation became public over the weekend. The probe stems from Powell's appearance before the US Senate Banking Committee in June, when he downplayed cost overruns related to the Fed office renovation and unnecessary luxury features, including rooftop terraces and gardens, premium marble flooring and private art collections. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott had raised concerns prompted by a New York Post article that likened the project to the French Palace of Versailles — the former royal residence near Paris commissioned by King Louis XIV. Powell pushed back at what he said were "inaccurate" and "misleading" claims and denied luxury add-ons, saying the project, which is self-funded by the Fed rather than via taxpayers, focused on modernization and long-term cost savings. A month later, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced that she was referring Powell to the Department of Justice (DOJ), accusing him of perjury and making false statements. As the DOJ rarely comments on active investigations, a spokesperson for the agency declined to react to Powell's statement on Sunday, but said: "The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars." In his video statement, Powell labeled the investigation as "unprecedented action," which he said is really linked to the Trump administration's pressure over interest‑rate policy. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. ... Those are pretexts. ... This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether, instead, monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," the Fed chair said. "Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats," Powell said, adding that he would continue to do the job "with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people." The probe caused a selloff in US stocks and the dollar on Monday, while Gold jumped to a record $4,600.33 per ounce. Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in the DOJ probe, but repeated his belief that Powell is "certainly not very good at the Fed and he's not very good at building buildings." In an interview with NBC News on Sunday night, Trump said: "What should pressure him [Powell] is the fact that rates are far too high — that's the only pressure he's got." As the central bank of the world's largest economy, the Fed's core mission is to set interest rates, keep inflation close to its 2% goal, support maximum employment and keep the financial system stable. It also supervises banks, acts as a lender of last resort during financial crises and helps keep credit flowing through the US economy, which has for decades also been the world's most attractive investment market. As the US dollar is the world's so-called reserve currency in which much of world trade is conducted, the Fed’s interest‑rate decisions have ripple effects globally, influencing borrowing costs, capital flows and economic growth far beyond the United States. The Fed is not funded by the US government; instead, it earns income from loans to corporate banks and its investments in US government bonds, currencies and other securities. The Fed's independence is widely seen as critical to avoid political pressure, which is often based on short-term goals because of the four-year US presidential election cycle. The bank's decisions to cut or raise interest rates are vital to prevent high inflation and steady the US economy during downturns. Though these moves may be unpopular among voters, proponents of Fed independence say handing interest rate control to elected politicians would risk destabilizing the economy. In reaction to the Powell probe, Capital Economics disputed whether central bank independence has helped keep inflation low historically and warned that high levels of public debt would make it harder to control price rises via interest rate hikes. But the London-based research house warned that "any shift away from monetary policy autonomy would send a worrying signal of a weaker commitment to maintaining low inflation." Many economists and corporate leaders believe that Trump's unprecedented tariffs have already hurt investor confidence in US sovereign debt and the economy's long-term future. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: Bitcoin ETF redemptions explain why BTC stalled near $91k

Bitcoin’s rally stalled near $91,000 as BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led more than $300m in redemptions. Bitcoin’s rally stalled on 12 January as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another daily negative flow to cap the week. BlackRock’s IBIT led the selling and triggered a wave of real BTC transfers to Coinbase Prime. According to Lookonchain data, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net outflow of 3,734 BTC on the day, equivalent to roughly $339 million at current prices. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT] accounted for the bulk of that move, shedding 2,791 BTC, while Grayscale’s products lost a further 891 BTC. The selling came as Bitcoin struggled to hold above the $91,000–$92,000 range, failing to sustain a breakout after a brief rally earlier in the session. Blockchain data adds a crucial layer to the ETF flows. Arkham Intelligence shows that wallets linked to BlackRock’s IBIT sent large tranches of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime within hours on 12 January. The transactions, visible on Arkham’s tracker, include a long series of transfers of 300 BTC each, alongside a smaller 143 BTC transaction. In total, the visible deposits exceed 3,400 BTC, broadly matching the size of IBIT’s reported daily outflow. Source: Arkham Intelligence Coinbase Prime is the primary settlement venue used by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. When ETF shares are redeemed, authorized participants receive Bitcoin, which is typically routed through Prime before being sold into the spot market or redistributed across trading desks. The on-chain flows therefore suggest that BlackRock’s ETF redemptions were not simply accounting entries but translated into real Bitcoin being delivered into exchange liquidity pools. The data highlights a structural shift in how Bitcoin trades since the launch of spot ETFs. While ETFs initially acted as a powerful demand engine in 2024, they now operate in both directions. When investors withdraw capital, ETF issuers must source Bitcoin from custody and deliver it into the market, turning redemptions into direct sell-side pressure. On 12 January, BlackRock alone was responsible for nearly three-quarters of total Bitcoin ETF outflows, making IBIT the dominant driver of the day’s liquidity event. Grayscale’s products also continued to see outflows, though on a smaller scale. At the same time, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded a modest +87 BTC inflow, insufficient to offset the broader selling. Bitcoin attempted to extend its January recovery earlier in the day but was rejected above $92,000, before sliding back toward $91,000 as ETF-linked selling emerged. The timing of the Arkham-tracked deposits aligns closely with the intraday reversal, reinforcing the view that institutional flow, not retail sentiment, is now setting short-term price direction. With more than 1.29 million BTC now held across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, even modest percentage shifts in investor positioning can translate into thousands of coins hitting the market in a single session. The episode underlines how Bitcoin has entered a new phase of market plumbing. ETF inflows and outflows are no longer just sentiment indicators; they now drive physical settlement flows that ripple directly into spot liquidity. BlackRock’s transfer of thousands of BTC to Coinbase Prime shows how quickly ETF demand can flip from absorption to distribution. Price action around key levels is now increasingly influenced by institutional portfolio decisions, rather than just speculative trading.

Title: GOP Sen. Thom Tillis says he will block any of Trump’s Fed picks over investigation into Powell

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said Sunday he will block any of President Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve following news of the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Tillis’ new stance could throw a monkey wrench into approval for any of Trump’s picks to lead the Fed or replace potential retirees — the Senate Banking Committee, which has 13 Republicans including Tillis plus 11 Democrats, must approve all central bank nominees. “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,” Tillis said in a Sunday statement. “I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,” added the senator, who is retiring. Powell’s term as chairman expires in May. It’s possible he could stay on as a Fed governor through 2028, though he has declined to comment on whether he will remain on the board. Powell confirmed Sunday that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into him related to the Fed’s renovation of its Washington, DC, headquarters — after months of Trump bashing the chairman as “Too Late Powell” for not slashing interest rates quickly enough. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said in a Sunday statement. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. Fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Tillis’ comments, accusing Trump of wanting to install a “sock puppet” to lead the central bank. “Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends,” said Warren, who years earlier called Powell a “dangerous man.” “This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.” Amid Trump’s broadsides against Powell, the White House has pressured Fed Governor Lisa Cook to step down, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook called those allegations “baseless.” Stephen Miran — Trump’s economic adviser who stepped into a seat vacated by Adriana Kugler — will see his term expire in January. There are also rumors about potential retirements from the board, such as Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh are reportedly in the lead in the race to chair the Federal Reserve. BlackRock exec Rick Rieder and Fed governor Christopher Waller have also been interviewed for the position. Prosecutors are investigating Powell over his testimony last summer about the central bank’s renovations. During an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied any involvement in the criminal probe. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” he said. “What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That’s the only pressure he’s got,” the president added. In December, Trump threatened to sue Powell for “gross incompetence,” adding that he’d love to fire him for not slashing rates at a fast enough pace. During an unrelated press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president fumed at the ballooning costs of Powell’s multi-year renovation of Fed headquarters near the National Mall. “It’s going to end up costing more than $4 billion — $4 billion!” Trump said. “Highest price of construction per square foot in the history of the world.” Last summer, Trump said he wouldn’t fire Powell after the pair wore matching hard hats and toured the central bank’s building renovation project, the cost of which has jumped from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion so far. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unforeseen events, like unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated and toxic contamination in the soil. But the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations,” according to the website. After their tour of the renovation site in July, Trump took questions from the press while Powell stood nearby. At one point, the president said the costs of the renovation were much higher than the latest price tag showed, but Powell quickly jumped in, saying Trump had included costs from a project completed years earlier.

Title: Porter injury 'didn't look promising' - Bleyendaal

Raf Diallo RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster attack coach Tyler Bleyendaal has admitted that the calf injury Andrew Porter picked up in training last week "didn't look promising" amid a growing front row predicament for Ireland in the build up to the Guinness Six Nations. The New Zealander also said fellow international Paddy McCarthy's foot injury "didn't look great". The prop sustained what the province describe as a "significant foot injury" during Saturday's dramatic 25-24 win over La Rochelle in the Investec Champions Cup. Porter missed that match as a result of his own setback and both he and McCarthy will be assessed before further confirmation on the extent of their respective injuries. "Yeah, obviously, Paddy's didn't look too great for him to come off immediately, so hopefully we get some clarity in the next few days," Bleyendaal told RTÉ Sport on Monday. "We're hoping for the best but it really didn't look too great to be honest and Ports the same. "To come out late in the week with that injury and again, waiting for the official kind of diagnosis, but it didn't look promising that it was going to be a quick turnaround. "So we're going to have to dig in and it's next man up, and we're going to have to find a way. "I thought the guys on the weekend did a great job and Jerry (Cahir) came on and he put his best foot forward and we're going to have to just dig deep into the depth and we've got some guys coming back as well. "So we lose some, we get some and whoever is available is going to have to do their best." McCarthy's injury comes at a time when the 22-year-old has built up real momentum for province and nation, having been rewarded with four caps during Ireland's Autumn Nations Series campaign. It is unclear how long the former Blackrock College student will be sidelined for. But the timing is far from ideal with the potential of a maiden Six Nations campaign just around the corner. "It's never a great time if it's a serious injury but like you say he's been playing so well," Bleyendaal said. "He's been a really valuable player for us - both sides of the ball. From the attack side, he gets us great momentum, defensively he's really solid and I think his set-piece is always improving. "He's been really good for us there. Like you say, he's got that taste of the Irish camp and no doubt he would have been involved again or hopefully still will be and that's why we'll go and get an update on him. "And fingers crossed, because like you say, he's been improving with every game and I think he's definitely got that Irish ambition." Jerry Cahir, who signed a short-term contract after impressing in the Energia All-Ireland League, replaced McCarthy following his withdrawal on Saturday, and the 25-year-old impressed Bleyendaal. "He's packing down scrums against some of the world's best and now he's learning, he's getting his opportunity and he's trying to put it all out there," he said. "It's great reward to see that he can come through that pathway and opportunities do arise. But it's a credit to those guys and their attitude." Bleyendaal also reserved praise for the development of wing Joshua Kenny, who weighed in with two tries against La Rochelle to bring his total up to eight in just six games for Leinster. "Just taking every opportunity that he's been given and he's obviously got some ball in some space and he's finished some tries for us which is great," he said. "But he's put in so much work off the ball as well and he's making cover tackles or he's getting invovled or he's chasing kicks. "He's come in at the start of the pre-season with a great attitude and have just been really impressed with him. "He's willing to make errors but he does it at full speed. He learns and he's willing to make errors and learn again so he's going through that process. "But he's great to watch with ball in hand and space, so it's our goal to get him more opportunities." © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Charles Hoskinson doubts CLARITY Act timeline, says Trump crypto czar should quit

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said the CLARITY Act may not pass this quarter, and criticized US crypto laws for favoring big banks over innovation. Cointelegraph in your social feed Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he doubts the US Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will pass this quarter and called on President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser, David Sacks, to resign. Hoskinson criticized the US approach to regulating crypto in an interview on Sunday with Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast Scott Melker on The Wolf of All Streets Podcast. “I don’t think the CLARITY Act is going to pass this quarter,” Hoskinson said, warning that if Democrats regain control of the US House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections, the current window to pass the bill could be lost. “If it doesn’t pass this quarter, I think Sacks should resign,” he added, blaming Sacks for “utterly failing” the crypto industry since taking on the role of Trump’s crypto czar in late 2024. Introduced in May 2025, the CLARITY Act cleared both the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee with bipartisan support. It seeks to clarify the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in regulating cryptocurrencies, and to provide guidance on different types of tokens. The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to vote on the bill later this week, in a potential milestone for the US crypto industry. In expressing doubts over the bill’s passage, Hoskinson said Sacks had “failed” the industry in three areas, including falling prices, lack of regulatory clarity and the absence of a strong foundation for building projects. “If you’re the czar and you’re in charge of this whole thing, I got to judge you by your track record. Most cryptos are down 40 to 50% since Trump took office. So the industry is unhealthy,” he said. Expanding on the industry’s struggles, Hoskinson also argued that other bills, such as the stablecoin-related GENIUS Act, favor large financial institutions over retail investors. “It [GENIUS Act] centralizes the industry around BlackRock, Cantor, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley and all these big guys,” he said, adding that the bill essentially “handed Wall Street the keys to the crypto kingdom.” Related: Coinbase could pull CLARITY Act support over stablecoin rewards ban Addressing Trump’s approach to crypto, including the controversial Trump memecoin, Hoskinson urged the US not to favor or nationalize cryptocurrency, warning it should remain a global, neutral product: Hoskinson said crypto laws should be passed carefully, with the industry united and the US government working alongside it rather than rushing for partisan gain. “Even if it takes longer to get done, the goal should be to pass rules that last and don’t harm innovation,” he said.

Title: Does Washington’s Global War Against China’s Oil Suppliers Stand Any Chance of Success?

Time Published: 2026-01-12T11:00:24Z

Does it make any sense? Among the White House demands of Venezuela is that it “kick out” China and sever economic ties. The Financial Times declares that “Donald Trump’s Venezuela action raises threat for China’s oil supplies.” As even Seymour Hersh reports: Their bluster and crude language transfixed the world’s media, but they also diverted attention from an opportunistic Trump plan whose goal was not only to unseat the corrupt President Nicolás Maduro, but also, crucially, to cut off China, America’s economic rival, from its ongoing purchases of Venezuela’s cheap heavy crude oil. Okay, but there’s a problem. China Does Not Rely on Venezuelan Oil While the mainstream media has mostly ignored this fact, it is clear: China is by far Venezuela’s largest oil customer (left chart: https://t.co/9SokdGJ3Z6). But Venezuela is a tiny fraction of China’s oil imports and doesn’t even make the top 10 for 2024 according to Chinese customs data (right chart: https://t.co/WrXoVAQKlj). pic.twitter.com/YAJi8HhuF7 — Kyle Chan (@kyleichan) January 7, 2026 China was the major buyer of crude from Venezuela, but those shipments made up only 4 per cent of China’s oil imports last year. Caracas did, however, provide a high-sulphur crude that’s used to produce bitumen, which is used for construction and road building, and Beijing was getting it at a steep discount thanks to U.S. sanctions on Venezuela sales. According to The Business Times, Beijing has plenty of that sludgy oil in reserve: … a hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months. Almost 82 million barrels is currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia, according to data intelligence firm Kpler. More than a quarter is Venezuelan and the rest is Iranian, it said. China could take a small hit from the US move in Venezuela. In September, China Concord Resources Corp. (CCRC) installed a self-elevating offshore oil platform in Lake Maracaibo. From Venezuelanalysis: The privately-owned China Concord secured a 20-year deal to run the Lago Cinco and Lagunillas Lago oilfields and will reportedly invest US $1 billion with the goal of raising production from the present 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd by the end of 2026. Chinese oil majors Sinopec and China National Petroleum also have legacy claims to develop Venezuelan oil reserves, but that appears unlikely if the US has its way. Still, let’s look at the makeup of Chinese oil imports, courtesy of the Financial Times: As the Times notes, those imports from Malaysia are believed to be mostly Iranian crude in a route to circumvent US sanctions. And following the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the American Zionists are now back focused on Tehran. Hersh also reported the obvious: The next target, I have been told, will be Iran, another purveyor to China whose crude oil reserves are the world’s fourth largest. And yet even if Washington and Israel are finally able to topple the government there, it would likely just drive Beijing and Moscow even closer together. Let’s look at how that energy relationship continues to evolve ever since Washington embarked on its grand plan topple the government in Moscow. First on natural gas. From Amwaj: Following the September summit of Chinese, Mongolian and Russian leaders in Beijing, Russia’s Gazprom and China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) agreed to launch the Power of Siberia-2 (PoS-2). The pipeline is designed to deliver up to 50B cubic meters (cm) of gas annually to China. Although no firm timeline is set, the project is expected to go online after 2030–31. China and Russia also decided to expand flows through existing gas pipelines. By 2028, the capacity of Power of Siberia-1 will rise from 38B to 44B cm. Meanwhile, the Far Eastern route—expected to enter service in 2027—will transfer 12B cm of gas, up from 10B. Moscow additionally plans to ramp up liquified gas exports to China via the new Arctic LNG-2 project and the existing Sakhalin-2 plant. Despite western sanctions on Russia, China began receiving Arctic LNG-2 cargo in late August, becoming the sole major customer of the project and thereby effectively keeping it alive. Notably, Beijing is expanding imports from Russia despite analysts’ assessment that existing contracts will likely cover the country’s needs over the next decade. It’s almost as if Beijing knows there’s a plan afoot to cut off its supplies and so is leaning on its most reliable and geographically convenient partner. And it’s doing the same with oil. Even if the US knocks out other suppliers and American pirates control most of the world’s seas blocking a huge chunk of the oil trade, disrupting that “dragonbear” hydrocarbon supply chain is a whole different game than Venezuela and Iran, as the years-long unsuccessful Project Ukraine has shown. But is there more at play than simply cutting supply to China. As Nick Corbishley pointed out Friday, even the most American-friendly states in Latin America are having a difficult time severing their relationship with China. Not even the US can do that. So what did Washington achieve on this front—if anything? Grand Industrial Planners or Spoiled Destructive Children? Despite all the talk of the oil and mineral bonanza in Venezuela, there are still loads of roadblocks, and someone will have to point to a recent example of the US successfully building anything. Note Of Extreme Caution To Comrades: DO NOT FALL FOR THE “IT’S ALL ABOUT OIL” LIE I’ve lived through multiple imperial wars where the so-called “left” reflexively responded with the same lazy line: “They’re just there for the oil.” I remember this explicitly during the First… pic.twitter.com/i03Y48xA2n — Chris Morlock (@CDMorlock) January 6, 2026 Morlock offers some important reminders, including: Do you seriously believe that Trump, along with his Palantir Technologies cronies, are about to become industrial planners? That without invasion, without regime change, without national reconstruction, they’ll somehow negotiate a $200 billion, 15-year industrial oil expansion in a country whose infrastructure has been deliberately strangled for a decade? This is a pipe dream of pipe dreams. What’s actually lined up for Venezuela is not extraction, but asset stripping. The firms positioned to “re-enter” Venezuela are overwhelmingly financial, not productive. Asset managers like BlackRock are positioned to absorb distressed sovereign and PDVSA-linked debt, restructure it, and turn future production into collateral streams rather than national revenue. U.S. and European oil majors are waiting not to build capacity but for production-sharing agreements, arbitration rulings, and debt-for-equity swaps that cap output and guarantee rents. Sanctions relief is used as leverage not to expand capacity, but to discipline the state and force Venezuela into IMF-style restructuring, privatization, and legal subordination to Western capital markets. They want the Chinese to pay for this oil in dollars, a minor nuisance for Xi, a silly ploy for the western rentier oligarchs. China reportedly holds roughly $19–20 billion in loans to Venezuela tied to “oil-for-loan” deals. That’s not much, but also won’t set a great precedent if Caracas defaults on the debt and ends resource exports to China. ‘Control’ Over Existing Production in Western Hemisphere? While oil majors are reluctant to jump into Venezuela, what about existing production in the Western Hemisphere? Javier Blas writes at Bloomberg of the US exerting control over all the oil production of countries—from Canada to Argentina— living under the “Donroe Doctrine.” That’s nearly 40 percent of the world’s oil output. Now Blas assumes the US can control this vast territory, but seeing Canada as a vassal state and the rightward, US-friendly turn of much of Latin America, could he be right—at least on the oil front? President Donald Trump now has his very own oil empire. And I’m talking about actual barrels already flowing into the market, not underground reserves that would take time and money to be developed1. With such resources Trump has an economic and geopolitical lever no US president has had since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s. At home and nearby, his country can tap a vast sea of oil. The implications of getting unfettered access to Venezuela’s reserves, the world’s largest, were immediately apparent to anyone in the energy and commodities business, particularly American foes. Oleg Deripaska, a US-sanctioned Russian oligarch, put it well on Saturday: Washington would have the means to keep the oil price close to $50 a barrel — giving it a winning hand in the future against anyone threatening to push the price higher by curbing supply. The Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said seizing power in Venezuela offered “huge leverage” over the global energy market. Having de facto control of the Western Hemisphere’s petroleum wealth is a geopolitical game changer. For decades, US military adventurism was constrained by the impact of any war on energy costs. Today the White House has primacy over oil-producing allies and adversaries alike — whether it’s Saudi Arabia or Iran, Nigeria or Russia. The past 18 months have already shown what these new hydrocarbon riches mean for US foreign policy. Trump’s administration has taken once unthinkable steps: from bombing Iranian nuclear facilities to helping Ukraine target Russian oil refineries. There is also talk that in the more immediate future the larger effect from the move against Venezuela could be in neighboring Guyana: While the world watches Venezuela, the real story might be next door in Guyana, where the world’s most important new oil frontier was under direct threat. Maduro’s claim to two-thirds of Guyana’s territory (Esequibo region) aimed to seize over 11 billion barrels of onshore and… pic.twitter.com/tHC6Ljh81D — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 5, 2026 And there’s the ol’ ‘swingman’ argument: ⚠️The US Has Only 7 Years of Reserves But is pumping 13 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY 🇺🇸🛢️ The United States sits outside the top 5 in proven oil reserves At current production rates, that’s ~7–8 years of reserve life. And yet… The US is the world’s oil swing machine 🔥 ~13 mb/d… pic.twitter.com/N4ssuY4aA6 — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 9, 2026 But what of China’s role as a “swingman”? As Kevin Walmsley notes: China is very well-insulated from any supply-side shocks for oil, no matter where from. This is a surprising situation now, for economists and experts in the oil market. China is the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, and the world’s biggest consumer of oil. The traditional thinking – until recently — is that it is the oil suppliers, like OPEC+, who determine the global price for oil, and that big importers, like China, are price takers in the market. Now, if the market faces oversupply, it would be OPEC members who would be price takers, temporarily, until they can push production down to balance supply and demand again. But a new development has scrambled all that convention wisdom: China’s enormous — and still growing — oil storage industry. That is putting a floor on the global prices—Chinese buy when oil prices fall enough, and stash the surplus into their tanks. But there is also a ceiling on price—if prices rise, China will just reduce imports or draw down inventories until prices fall again. Where does it leave us? It sounds a lot like an inverted strategy against Russia. Rather than stopping Moscow’s ability to sell, Washington is now after Beijing’s ability to buy. The real danger for Beijing—and for the rest of the world— is not that the US is likely to succeed; it is that a newly emboldened Washington believes it can threaten, topple, smash, and grab whoever it wants wherever it wants. And it treats the world as a game of Risk. This is the strategic map by @ConGeostrategy you must study in the New Cold War between the Anglosphere and the DragonBear. Venezuela is no longer red. Greenland will face growing American presence. The main interconnected flashpoints will be from the Arctic to the Indo-Pacific. pic.twitter.com/kUFtOUkPaZ — Velina Tchakarova (@vtchakarova) January 8, 2026 This is a good analysis as far as drawing in almost all the relevant threads, including neighboring Guyana where GDP has grown by some 30 percent each of the last two years after the discovery of the offshore oilfield there. What it leaves out of the equation is this— Trump says he will visit Beijing in April and host China’s Xi for a state visit later next year https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-taiwan-aab2ec36f55abc9e98d91a5f0d133a92 Current thinking in China is that Trump wants as much leverage as he can get right now in the short term to reach a grand agreement analogous to the Nixon-Mao summit 55 years ago which set the global power balance in the US’s favor for the following 40 years. Trump’s aim at this Trump-Xi summit is to do that for the next 40 years. And yes, as Conor’s OP notes, the Chinese could reset their oil imports to make up the loss of S. America oil imports with increased Russian imports. But there’s a debate now in China as to whether it wants to make itself that strategically dependent on Russia going forward. Pragmatically, then, Xi and China could take the option of playing along with an agreement which lets Trump return from China claiming that China has acceded in whatever degree to Trump and the US’s terms in the knowledge that, firstly, no such agreement is in the long term worth the paper it’s written on if it’s not advantageous to both sides and, secondly, US decline is baked in at this point. Conversely, though, part of what Trump and the US want is for China to acknowledge No 2 pole position behind the US as the No. 1 global hegemon and also to resume buying US treasury debt — which is now over $38 trillion — in the quantities China formerly did. (Because, honestly, who else can buy enough of it at this point?) Does China need to accept that? What’s the best strategy to handle this dangerous, declining (and frankly racist, in the Chinese view) hegemon, the USA? A big complicating factor is that — as Conor also notes — China believes that, immediately following April and this Trump-Xi summit — where Trump intends to have settled US-China hegemonic relations for the next few decades in the US favor — Trump and the US will then pivot to Iran to settle the disposition of the Middle East as US-Israel wish to have it in the coming decades. Furthermore, Washington and Israel understand that attacking Iran will likely mean that it then close downs oil exports from the Middle East, possibly for years if it attacks and destroys its neighbor’s oil fields. Indeed, they’re planning for it. Europe currently gets roughly 10–15% of its crude oil from the Middle East, for instance. The world’s biggest oil exporter is already the US and, going forward, it intends to control the fifth of proven global oil reserves in South and Central America. So the US will then be able to demand whatever it wants to ask for oil going to the EU…. And so on. You may believe this Trump-US strategy is nutso in its narcissistic grandiosity and has too many moving parts not to fail. But, honestly, it’s no more nutso grandiose that the preceding US plan under the neocons to disassemble Russia and cannibalize its resources in order to recollateralize US and the ‘West’s’ capitalist order. That was Plan A , if you like (to put on my inner Alastair Crooke), and the current Trump-US plan is Plan B. In short, no it won’t work. What stands out here is not whether Washington can meaningfully disrupt China’s access to Venezuelan or Iranian oil – the evidence suggests it cannot – but how misaligned this entire strategy is with the realities now unfolding. Even if U.S. pressure succeeded in constraining a few sanctioned supply routes, it would do nothing to change the underlying condition shaping global power: accelerating climate breakdown. Global heating has already reached 1.5 °C, far sooner than expected, and is now driving non-linear damage across economic and social systems. The clearest signal is coming from the insurance industry, where catastrophic losses are doubling roughly every decade and coverage is being withdrawn from whole regions. When insurance fails, infrastructure investment stalls, housing markets seize up, and state capacity erodes regardless of who controls marginal oil flows. Against that backdrop, oil-centric power games resemble a contest over a resource whose strategic value is already collapsing under physical constraints. The binding limit is no longer access to barrels, but the atmosphere’s diminishing ability to absorb emissions without triggering cascading failures. China’s real insulation does not come from Venezuelan crude or Russian pipelines alone, but from diversification, storage, electrification, and a rapid pivot toward energy systems less exposed to climate risk. By contrast, strategies built around interdiction, asset stripping, and hemispheric dominance assume a stable world in which energy rents can still be converted into durable power. That world is ending. The danger is not that Washington will succeed in cutting China off from oil. It is that major powers remain locked in 20th-century geopolitical scripts while the financial, insurance, and ecological foundations that made those scripts viable are already giving way. Control over energy matters less when the systems that insure, finance, and govern its use are themselves breaking down. Thank you for this very interesting comment. I was mentally fumbling with some thoughts along similar lines. The fear is that the death throes of the incumbent geopolitical system, which is still capable, as we have seen, of wielding great destructive power, are taking us all down with it. I think this space had a comment link a few weeks back that indicated the US and its Isrl partner had plans to produce technology to Geo-engineer the arctic via aerosol dimming to drop the temperature with a yearly rentist model. My guess is if this is so, and they are the first movers to affect lowering of the arctic temps they will be able to hold the world hostage from super-heating the rest of the world and blocking an ice free arctic. Were this to be the new normal, a kind of inverse Dr Stranglove would emerge, where a small group would get their rocks off on seeing others just sweat (literally in places) until they could to pay the fees for this years installment. I would bet the same brinkmanship would occur which is seen when US congress wants to stall on paying employees and just stops paying its government employees until a deal is done. So no need to worry, the two current belligerents have our back in the Climate Change front,,,,and a captive planet…. then they can move to near earth orbit and the outer rim, having sewn up this little place for now as a reseource and revenue stream. I haven’t seen this mentioned yet, but about a year ago Reuters reported that US refiners were running out of heavy sour crude for their refineries, and were contemplating retrofitting them for light sweet crude, which is a rather expensive endeavor, I am led to believe. https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-refiners-mull-switch-alternative-lighter-crudes-amid-trump-tariff-fears-2025-02-20/ Prices have two sides – buyer and seller. If the price of oil, like the Russian Oligarch above, stays at $50 a barrel or lower it will also harm American shale-oil producers who have a $60 cost of production. If Oil prices go up or supplies get limited and China has to pay more for oil, then they will increase prices on manufactured goods and inflation will get passed on to over-consuming countries like the US. Trump’s biggest challenge is improving the lives of voting Americans, not moving pieces on some grand chessboard with the pawns representing foreign countries. He has until early November to pull it off and so far, it doesn’t look like cracking down on illegal immigrants is getting him there. The Chris Morlock tweet is informative, but why the rants about “the left” and end consumers? The US did not rebuild Iraqi infrastructure or import Iraqi oil, yet it controls it. This is the Trump template for Venezuela; control now, consumption later. Why does the US still control every penny of Iraqi oil revenues? Cradle Since the signing of Executive Order 13303 (EO13303) by President George W Bush on 22 May 2003, all revenues from Iraq’s oil sales have been funneled directly into an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. EO13303, titled “Protection of the Development Fund for Iraq and Other Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest,” has been renewed annually by every US president, including Joe Biden in 2024. This executive order essentially places control over Iraq’s oil revenues under the discretion of the US President, leaving Baghdad with limited control over its resources and earnings. The shale plays will be tapped out in the coming decade and the US then pivots to Venezuelan heavy and Alberta tar sands. Climate is not a problem for an 80 yo Trump. The US is a net importer of crude oil (40%) but a net exporter of refined petroleum products (at a profit). The main crude import is from Canadian ‘tar sands’. I’m sure Venezuelan crude looks very inviting to Grump. But that heavy crude is in the future (10 yrs) and lots of capital investment before it can put a dent in the US need for diesel, jet fuel, etc.. Total US oil products consumption is nearly as large as it’s production. Upsetting the oil markets will likely increase the price of gasoline to Americans. (“It’s the economy, stupid!”) Crude Oil Production Current Production Rate: Approximately 13.4 million barrels per day (MMb/d). Production Growth: Increased by 2.5% in 2024, marking a 165% rise since 2008. Domestic Supply: About 60% of the crude oil processed in U.S. refineries is produced domestically. Refined Product Exports Export Rate: In 2024, the U.S. exported around 10.71 million barrels per day of petroleum products. Composition of Exports: 38% of exports were crude oil. 62% were refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Export Growth: Exports of petroleum products rose by 8.3% in 2024. What I find fascinating is that all the major US oil companies seem to have just told Trump publicly that there is no way that they are investing in Venezuela. Well, I think Chevron said it can double production. Clearly Trump and his team did their usual due diligence, wide consultation, and careful advanced planning. I believe the detailed plan read: 1. Kidnap Maduro 2. A miracle occurs 3. We steal the oil Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS
