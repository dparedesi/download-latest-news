Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF recorded $875 million in inflows on Oct. 30, marking its highest single-day inflow since its January launch, according to CoinGlass data. The latest figure surpasses the previous record of $849 million set on March 12 for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). “Pretty apropos that the biggest daily inflow ever for $IBIT is what pushed the US spot ETFs over the 1 million bitcoin held mark,” said Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. US ETFs acquired 12,418 Bitcoin on Oct. 30, with BlackRock holding 429,129 BTC, Grayscale maintaining 220,415 BTC, and Fidelity possessing 188,592 BTC. BlackRock’s ETF has reached $29.3 billion in assets, with nearly half of that accumulated in the past month. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BREAKING: Canary Capital Files For Spot Solana ETF

Time Published: 2024-10-30T21:41:36Z

Asset manager Canary Capital has officially filed for a spot Solana ETF in the United States, following in the footsteps of investment firm VanEck, which introduced its own application four months ago. The Solana ETF move was confirmed minutes ago by Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Despite not having a live exchange-traded fund in the US, unlike established issuers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, Canary Capital’s filing signals its continued intent to enter the crypto ETF space following the significant uptake seen in recent months. The asset manager, based in Sydney and established in 2017, has been proactive in pursuing a variety of crypto-related ETFs. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, just weeks ago, it submitted similar S-1 form applications for XRP and Litecoin ETFs. This move comes as in January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a series of Bitcoin ETFs, marking a major milestone for crypto investment products in the country. The approval of 12 Bitcoin funds was followed by the green light for Ethereum-based ETFs in July, further legitimizing the cryptocurrency market. Despite these advancements, the paths for cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana, and Litecoin remain fraught with uncertainty due to ongoing debates about their classifications as either securities or commodities—a critical factor in the SEC’s approval process. It is yet to be seen whether additional investment firms will pursue similar spot Solana ETF applications or wait for clearer regulatory guidance, especially in light of the upcoming US presidential election. The current contrasting positions of pro-Bitcoin candidate Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could influence the trajectory of cryptocurrency regulations, potentially affecting the approval process for these ETFs in the upcoming year.

Title: Matt Mullenweg talks about Automattic’s staffing issues and financials at TechCrunch Disrupt

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us WordPress co-creator and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg talked about his fight with WP Engine, Automattic’s staffing issues, and the company’s financials at TechCrunch Disrupt on Wednesday. Mullenweg repeated a lot of stuff from the past month about the trademark fight, WP Engine not contributing to the community, and misleading customers to believe it was associated with WordPress.com. If you need a refresher on the WordPress community drama, we have an article that will help you catch up. He said the company was short-staffed after the exodus of 159 employees, who took a six-month severance offer earlier that month. Since then, Automattic has been aggressively hiring and had already recruited 26 people this month. Mullenweg said that the second offer — which had nine months of severance and lost access to WordPress.org as part of the package — was designed to catch a leaker within the company giving out confidential information. He added that the company had to ask others who took the offer to stay until the next year as they were short-staffed. Talking about trademark issues, Mullenweg said in the initial days of Automattic, he gave the WordPress Foundation the WordPress trademark as investors were in control of Automattic. While the foundation still owns the trademark, Automattic has the exclusive license to use it commercially. Plus, Mullenweg said he has 84% of vote control at the company. When asked about what the other WordPress Foundation board members think about this battle, he said they are incredibly supportive and referred to the minutes of the meetings published on the foundation site — the post doesn’t mention anything about the trademark. Automattic CEO also talked about the legal battle with WP Engine and said that it might take a few years to resolve it. “Estimates I have heard from Neil [Katyal, the lawyer representing Automattic] in the case and others is that worst case scenario, if we lose everything, it would be kind of happening in 2026 or 2027,” he said. Earlier this year, Blackrock, one of the investors in Automattic, marked down their investment to almost half the value from the time they bought the shares in 2021. While Mullenweg didn’t directly address that markdown, he said the company generates around half a billion dollars in annual revenue, running at “break even or better,” and hiring aggressively. “We haven’t raised any primary capital and have no plans to,” Mullenweg said. Talking about the possibility of a WordPress fork because of ongoing tension in the community, Mullenweg said that would be fantastic. “There might be a fork. I mean, we’ve had WordPress forks before — probably about three or four times in the history [of WordPress]. That’s one of the beautiful things about open source is that there can be a fork,” he said.

Title: Bloomberg Analyst Attributes Surging Bitcoin ETF Inflows to FOMO Frenzy

Time Published: 2024-10-30T19:06:07Z

Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have performed well in recent weeks, with consecutive inflows attributed to the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. At press time, these ETFs had $72.55 billion in net assets, equivalent to 5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. On October 29, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF had its best day in terms of trading volumes in six months after recording $3.3 billion in value traded. During the day, the IBIT ETF posted $642M in inflows. The other Bitcoin ETFs also saw positive flows, apart from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which had $17M in outflows. Fidelity and Bitwise saw $133M and $52M inflows, respectively, while VanEck and Ark Invest posted $16M and $12M inflows. The total inflows by the US spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $870M, marking the highest inflows since June. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, the spike in volumes for BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was “a bit odd” given the slight gains in Bitcoin prices, Therefore, the high volumes could be a result of “FOMO-ing frenzy.” “IBIT is not alone – although by far the most – as all the main BTC ETFs saw elevated volumes in the past two days. If this is a FOMO Frenzy, we’ll see it show up in the flows next few nights,” Balchunas said. The inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have made these products hit a crucial milestone. Following Tuesday’s massive trading volumes, these products have 995,663 coins. These ETFs are now inching closer to surpassing the total assets held by the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto holds 1.1M Bitcoin, and if these inflows continue, the products could cross the 1M mark by the end of the week. Balchunas noted that the Bitcoin ETFs had a “legit shot” of surpassing Satoshi’s holdings by the end of November. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has also surpassed another milestone after hitting $30 billion in assets after the recent inflows following the recent price surge. The analyst stated that the product reached the $30 billion mark in under 300 days, marking a record high. Data from the IBIT website shows that the product holds around 417,000 coins, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin traded at $71,953 at press time after a slight 0.7% gain in 24 hours. In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained by around 8%.

Title: Bitcoin Price Primed For Monumental Surge To $100,000 By January 2025 — Market Researchers Explain Why

The wider crypto market has been abuzz following Bitcoin’s recent impressive performance, which has resulted in the premier crypto getting precariously close to revisiting its current all-time high price. Crypto research firm 10X Research has suggested that Bitcoin’s price could trade at least $100,000 by January 2025. The Bitcoin price prediction comes as Bitcoin enjoyed a rapid march above the $73,000 level, nearing the March ATH during late trading on Tuesday, before retreating slightly today. Analysts foresee Bitcoin at $100,000 by early next year. According to 10x Research, the six-figure target for the leading cryptocurrency is based on its model that recently produced two buy signals, with the recent one being on Oct. 14. The analysts claim that their prediction model has a track record of around 87% accuracy based on the previous 15 signals. 10X Research explained the rationale for the upbeat Bitcoin projection: “When Bitcoin sets a new six-month high for the first time in 6 months like it did recently, we typically see a median return of 40% over the next 3 months.” Given the analysts’ calculations, a 40% growth from the current market price of $72,200 would propel Bitcoin above $100,000 by Jan. 27, 2025. Soaring demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now nearly hold 1 million BTC in assets under management, indicates massive institutional interest. These ETFs, launched in January 2024, attracted approximately $4 billion in fresh investor money in October alone. Moreover, institutional investors like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, now consider BTC a viable long-term investment or digital gold. “Gold has always been seen as a safe haven asset, so if Bitcoin is the new digital gold, it makes sense that institutions would be interested,” 10X Research asserted. Meanwhile, the researchers also forecasted that Republican Party frontrunner Donald Trump would win the United States presidential election next week, which could be a considerable boon for the crypto market. Trump, who is known for his U-turn on Bitcoin in recent years, has promised to make America “the crypto capital of the world”. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a hostile stance on crypto companies, prompting many in the industry to see the Democrats — who currently control the White House — as anti-crypto. The former president has also vowed to oust current SEC chair Gary Gensler on his first day of office. However, some pundits have maintained that the cryptosphere’s growth is inevitable regardless of who wins the election.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has clearly been the dominant investment theme of 2024 and is the next major technology wave. According to IDC, spending on AI will be in excess of $631 billion by 2028. With ever increasing interest and spending in AI, there are also a rising number of ways to participate in this massive theme. ETF baskets are a great way to gain exposure. Just this week, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, launched two new ETFs, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF (TEK). There are likely many more on the way. However, not all are created equal. Some of the beneficiaries of AI may not be immediately obvious. These include Data Center REITs like Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX) as well as companies that are involved with the construction the infrastructure for data centers as represented in the ETF PAVE. Also, the need to generate increased electrical production in the U.S. has had a positive effect on Utilities. In addition, nuclear power is making a comeback in the U.S. Hence, uranium stocks are performing better as one can see in the performance of URA. Stronger Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 1: Weekly Charts of Leading AI-Related ETFs Weaker Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 2: Weekly Charts of Lagging AI-Related ETFs Broad Market ETFs: Figure 3: Weekly Charts of the Above Two ETFs There are many use cases for AI, most relating to costs savings and efficiency/productivity gains across nearly every sector. Some of the larger being search assistance, automated machine learning, data-driven marketing, fraud/network intrusion detection, financial robo-advisory, supply chain optimization, factory automation, self-driving technology, drug discovery, and more recently generative AI, among others. There will be many opportunities in those companies that can harness the technologies. But we would like to now take a closer look at some of the beneficiaries of all of the spending happening to create the necessary infrastructure, in particular the powering of all of the growing use cases: data centers. In terms of data centers, according to industry estimates, the market size could rise from around $200B in 2022 to nearly $450B by 2028. McKinsey notes that electricity demand from data centers is expected to rise by over 150% by 2030. It usage will rise from under 2% compared to total installed capacity to >4% over the period. While it is a small portion, it is still a huge amount of new power needed. Hyperscalers like Alphabet, Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) account for around 40% of the data center capacity. Non-hyperscalers (colocation) account for ~25% and on premise for the remainder. Figure 4: Growth in Data Center Electricity Demand As we mentioned in our May Forbes article, “Power Up Your Portfolio With Utilities,” United States overall electricity demand should rise +1 to 3% a year for the next decade. Current estimates could continue to rise. Other more aggressive estimates put the percentage of electricity consumption from data centers in the high-single digits by 2030. Recent power supply deals from Microsoft and Alphabet underscore the coming growth, as well as the continued need to shift towards clean energy sources. Although the Nasdaq 100 and Mega Cap growth groups were huge outperformers over about an 18-month period from the beginning of 2023, they have trailed off in relative terms recently. There has been a shift in leadership from the spenders (hyperscalers) as the leaders to the infrastructure product and services, and energy providers, particularly related to data centers. Below are 25 O’Neil Industry Groups related in some way to data centers, detailed with some price performance and other metrics. Nearly all have been winners over the trailing 52 weeks, however, over eight to 13 weeks, there is a large separation between the top few and the rest. Figure 5: List of O’Neil Industry Groups Related to Data Centers In Conclusion The AI revolution offers many exciting investment opportunities beyond simply semiconductors and software. In particular, companies that construct, operate, and power data centers are likely to be strong beneficiaries of this massive trend. We encourage investors to explore these areas in greater detail as we believe many of these stocks will be market leaders over the next decade.­­ Kenley Scott, Director, Global Sector Strategist at William O’Neil + Co., made significant contributions to the data compilation, analysis, and writing for this article.

Title: BusConnects corridor linking Tallaght and Clondalkin to Dublin city centre finally approved
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2024/10/30/busconnects-corridor-linking-tallaght-and-clondalkin-to-dublin-city-centre-finally-approved/
Time Published: 2024-10-30T17:11:33Z

The BusConnects corridor linking Tallaght and Clondalkin to Dublin city centre, has been approved by An Bord Pleanála, almost a year after the decision was initially due. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has sought permission for 12 dedicated bus lanes as part of its programme to overhaul the capital’s bus system. The Tallaght/Clondalkin core bus corridor is the ninth scheme approved to date. The NTA submitted the Tallaght/Clondalkin application in April 2023. The board had been due to issue its decision in November 2023, but despite determining there was no requirement for an oral hearing, permission was not granted until this month. The 15.5km corridor will run from The Square Shopping Centre, Tallaght and Nangor Road, Clondalkin, to Nicholas Street near St Patrick’s Cathedral in the city centre. The route passes through Ballymount, Walkinstown, Drimnagh, Crumlin and Dolphin’s Barn, and is expected to remove more than 100,000 daily car trips from the roads. The BusConnects programme has two strands: a network redesign and the 12 bus corridors. Unlike the redesign project, which involves the reorganisation of services on existing road infrastructure, the corridors require construction to achieve segregation of bus and cycle lanes from traffic. In some instances this necessitates road widening, and the acquisition of property, including parts of front gardens, and felling of trees. An Bord Pleanála received 55 submissions on the Tallaght/Clondalkin project, mostly from local residents along the route, as well as 19 objections to compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) for land acquisition, the majority of which came from commercial property owners. The 55 submissions varied from residents concerned about the loss of privacy, green space and safety concerns in relation to road widening; to the reduction in space for cars and the requirement for private motorists to take more circuitous routes. Other submissions said insufficient provision had been made for cyclists, with bicycles required to share space with buses and cars over parts of the route. Most CPO objections related to loss of parking for customers and deliveries. One homeowner objected to the acquisition of 3m of his driveway, leaving him with 10m, which was insufficient, he said, as “parking is required for at least six cars and space to turn in the driveway”. In recommending permission be granted the board’s inspector Donal Donnelly said the scheme would “make a significant contribution to carbon reduction, the easing of congestion and the creation of more sustainable travel patterns for the growing population”. It was also “essential to bring about improved connections, particularly for non-car users, the disadvantaged and vulnerable road users”. [ Blanchardstown route is latest BusConnects corridor to be challenged in High CourtOpens in new window ] The impact on private car users had “been kept to a minimum”, he said. “The fact that two-way general traffic has been retained throughout most of this core bus corridor, indicates to me that the proposed scheme may have gone further to accentuate modal shift from the private car to bus transport/active travel. “Had the proposed scheme been designed at the present time, when climate change is becoming increasingly apparent, rather than a number of years ago, it may have been more radical in tackling car dominance.” However, he said, “on balance, I have concluded that the overall benefits of the proposed scheme considerably outweigh the negatives”. The eight other schemes approved by the board run to the city from Liffey Valley, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Ballymun/Finglas, Swords, Ringsend, Blanchardstown and Lucan. Routes from Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Kimmage and Bray await the decision of the board. Three of the approved schemes, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock and Blanchardstown, are the subject of ongoing judicial review proceedings. Construction of the first schemes is due to start next year.

Title: Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Could Be The Hottest Investment Of 2024: Don’t Miss Out On This Groundbreaking Crypto Project

The last quarter of the year has historically led to significant price increases for cryptocurrencies. With only two months left in 2024, investors are moving towards promising crypto projects. ETFSwap (ETFS) has gained the interest of the crypto community, with several industry observers regarding it as the hottest investment of 2024. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a groundbreaking crypto project that aims to add exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the blockchain through tokenization. ETFSwap (ETFS) will allow its users to convert between cryptocurrencies and a range of ETFs, including Currency ETFs, Crypto ETFs, Index ETFs, Commodity ETFs, and more. Notably, the crypto project’s team will work closely with Mica-Compliant investment banks to guarantee the legitimacy and financial integrity of its tokenized assets. Thanks to its blockchain-based foundation, ETFSwap’s ETF transactions will be faster, safer, and more cost-effective, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. The ETFSwap platform is also built on the ERC20 standard, which will allow for staking, token swaps, liquidity provision, and more. ETFSwap (ETFS) will redefine ETF trading further by providing market-making and perpetual trading capabilities, with round-the-clock market coverage and margin options of up to 10x. The platform will also feature the ETF Screener and ETF Tracker, which are AI-based tools that will conduct various analyses to give user-specific investment recommendations. To access the ETFSwap platform, users will require the ETFS token. This criterion gives the ETFS token utility and makes sure its holders use the complete set of ETF services and advantages offered on the platform. The ETFS token will also be used for other functions, including governance, fee payment, conversion, and interoperability. ETFSwap (ETFS) began with a private fundraising round, securing $750,000 from investors who share the crypto project’s vision. The presale round was then initiated to offer the opportunity for broader participation, with 40% of the fixed 1 billion ETFS token supply set aside for distribution. Since the presale launch, ETFSwap (ETFS) has achieved several key milestones. Most notably, the platform went live on the testnet on October 9, with its core functionality and UI thoroughly tested. Additionally, CyberScope and SolidProof audited the crypto project’s smart contracts and team KYC. ETFSwap (ETFS) was also successfully listed on CoinMarketCap, further boosting its credibility. The ETFSwap presale has also seen remarkable progress, with the ETFS price increasing by more than 350% from its Stage 1 value of $0.00854 to its current $0.03846 in Stage 3. This stage is already 62% complete, with less than 28 million ETFS tokens remaining and more than $5.61 million raised, reflecting strong investor confidence in the crypto project. Crypto ETFs have been rising in popularity in 2024, driven by major investment firms like BlackRock entering the space and the emergence of new options like Solana ETFs. ETFSwap (ETFS) is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this growing interest by offering a decentralized and more versatile platform for ETF trading and investing. The crypto project is also set to launch its own ETF in 2025, making it among the hottest investments of 2024. Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which also ranks among the hottest investments in 2024. The inclusion of AI-driven tools reduces human error, speeds up decision-making processes, and empowers users to make informed choices, ensuring a more robust and profitable trading experience. This gives ETFSwap (ETFS) a significant edge over many ETF trading platforms, potentially attracting more users over time. Furthermore, the massive investments and positive comments from crypto experts suggest that ETFSwap (ETFS) is gaining significant popularity while in its early stages. Low-cap tokens like ETFSwap (ETFS) are usually among the hottest investments because they have the ability to multiply in value rapidly as demand increases. This, coupled with a relatively low entry price, means that even small investments could yield substantial profits for investors, making ETFSwap (ETFS) one of the hottest investments of 2024. While investment varies depending on individual goals and risk tolerances, the technology, potential, and massive investments in the ETFSwap (ETFS) crypto project suggest that it could be one of the hottest investments of 2024.

Title: Ray Dalio doesn't like the choice between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump
URL: https://qz.com/ray-dalio-bridgewater-harris-trump-president-elections-1851685388
Time Published: 2024-10-30T16:43:23Z
Full Content:
Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio isn’t too thrilled about the prospect of either a Kamala Harris or (second) Donald Trump administration. “Both of the candidates worry me,” Dalio told CNBC in an interview at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. “This left, right and fighting each other is a problem as it becomes more of the extremes,” he said. “I think there needs to be a bringing of Americans together, that middle of that, and making great reforms. … There needs to be a strong leader of the middle, I believe, that makes great reforms. ... Neither of the candidates does that for me.” Dalio, who has previously criticized the worsening divisions in U.S. politics (going so far as to warn that the country may be “on the brink” of a civil war back in May), said he is concerned about a number of issues facing the country that he feels neither candidate is ready to address. “The debt is concerning, the internal conflict is concerning, the external conflict is concerning, and certainly the climate and the cost of the climate is concerning,” he said. National debt, which is nearing the $36 trillion mark, has become a major area of concern for Dalio, as well as several other business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM-1.11%) CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock (BLK+0.15%) CEO Larry Fink. “We have a real debt problem,” Dalio said. “I think one man’s debts is another man’s assets.” Dimon has similarly warned that the debt problem could be a thorn in the side of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to keep inflation down. The JPMorgan chief has said he is “a little more skeptical that inflation is going to go away so easily.” Although inflation has been trending downward, Dimon government deficits as a major inflationary risk that could cause price growth to spike again in coming years. Although Dalio said Trump will likely be better for domestic capital markets, both candidates’ plans will likely add to the ballooning debt. That’s in line with a recent report from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). The analysis found that both candidates’ proposed economic agendas are almost guaranteed to raise the federal debt by at least a couple trillion dollars — but Trump would add nearly double what Harris would contribute. While Harris would add $3.5 trillion in debt through fiscal year 2035, Trump is expected to add $7.5 trillion, according to the CRFB. According to a Goldman Sachs (GS-1.24%) report from September, a Harris win and a Democratic sweep would be the best-case scenario for the overall U.S. economy, noting that her middle-class tax credits would outweigh any downward pressure on investment from higher corporate taxes.

Here's how the company performed, compared with analysts' expectations based on a survey by LSEG: Revenue increased 16% year over year in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, according to a statement. Net income rose 11% to $24.67 billion from $22.29 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the current quarter, Microsoft called for revenue in the range of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion. That implies 10.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $69.83 billion in revenue. Outside suppliers are late in delivering data center infrastructure to Microsoft, meaning the company won't be able to meet demand in the fiscal second quarter. "I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply-demand will match up," CEO Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts. In August, Microsoft said it would revise the reporting of business segments to reflect its management approach. Mobility and security services, along with some Windows revenue, are now part of the productivity and business processes unit, which includes Office software. Revenue from productivity and business processes rose 12% to $28.32 billion in the quarter, topping the $27.9 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount. It's 38% higher than the $20.45 billion midpoint of the forecast that management gave in July, because the actual total accounts for the changes. Investors received a clearer picture of cloud computing consumption at Microsoft. For the first time, the Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric excludes mobility and security and Power BI data analytics sales. Azure growth for the quarter came in at 33%, or 34% at constant currency, with 12 points coming from artificial intelligence services. CNBC's consensus for Azure growth was 32.8%, while StreetAccount's was 29.4%. "Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity," Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said on the call. Hood called for 31% to 32% Azure growth at constant currency for the fiscal second quarter. The full intelligent cloud segment, including Azure, Windows Server and enterprise services, generated $24.09 billion in revenue. That's up 20% and slightly more than the $24.04 StreetAccount consensus. On Tuesday, Google reported 35% annual growth in its rival cloud business to $11.35 billion. Amazon, which leads the cloud infrastructure market, is scheduled to report results Thursday. Microsoft has shrunken the size of its segment called more personal computing through the reporting changes. In the latest quarter, it contributed $13.18 billion in revenue, up about 17% from a yeaer earlier and above the $12.56 billion StreetAccount consensus. The company saw 2% growth in sales of devices and sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Industry researcher Gartner estimated that quarterly PC shipments declined 1.3%. Microsoft's AI investments continue to be a major focus for investors, as the company builds out its infrastructure and ramps up chip spending to handle heftier workloads. Microsoft is the main investor in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which was valued at $157 billion in a financing round earlier this month. As of Sept. 30, Microsoft had racked up more than $108 billion in finance leases that had not started, which UBS analysts have said might include third-party cloud spending to meet AI demand. At the same time, Microsoft has been spending more cash on property and equipment. In the first quarter, spending grew 50% year over year to $14.92 billion. The consensus among analysts polled by Capital IQ was $14.58 billion. As of Wednesday's close, Microsoft was up about 15% for the year, while the Nasdaq gained around 24% during the same period.

Title: Jefferies: Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) Is A Crowded Short Software Stock Among Institutional Investors
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-palantir-technologies-inc-nyse-154141255.html
Time Published: 2024-10-30T15:41:41Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Jefferies’ Top Crowded Software Short Positions: Top 9 Stocks. In this piece, we will take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) ranks on the list of crowded software short positions. With the close of 2024 approaching fast, artificial intelligence continues to set the narrative on Wall Street. The tail end of October marks the start of another highly anticipated earnings season, which for the most part, will continue to be dominated by AI. On the hardware front, investors will be on the lookout for whether the demand for AI GPUs is sustaining and if the firm that is the market leader is also improving its margins and profitability. For software stocks, investors will pour over profitability data to determine whether the billions of dollars invested in training and testing AI as well as in business partnerships are yielding results. For software stocks, their exposure to AI is so strong that it has divided the 2024 stock performance of some firms into neat halves determined by investor sentiment about their AI products. One such AI software stock ranked 5th on our recent list of AI stocks that insiders are selling. Looking at its year-to-date share price performance, it’s rather neatly divided into two halves that converge on June 13th. Year to date on June 13th, the shares were down 19.8% even though the firm’s fiscal 2023 revenue was a cool $19.4 billion and had grown by 10% annually. Before that eventful day, the firm’s first quarter had seen it grow revenue by 11% annually but struggle to keep costs low and profit margins high. Yet, the investor bearishness surrounding this well-known provider of productivity software tools such as Photoshop and Reader, would change in the blink of an eye. From June 13th to the third week of October, the shares have reversed course and gained 8.5%. In fact, between the 13th and September 12th, the stock had gained 27.9%. June 13th was the day that this firm reported its second-quarter earnings. The results led to its shares jumping by 13% in aftermarket trading, with investors impressed by the fact that the firm increased full-year guidance to range between $21.40 billion and $21.50 billion from an earlier $21.30 billion $21.50 billion. The optimism was driven in part by the firm’s Creative Cloud business which includes products such as Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, and Express. The AI addition to Creative Cloud was the firm’s set of generative AI models dubbed Firefly. Management shared that Firefly was at the heart of the ARR guidance bump to $1.95 billion as they shared: “We’re excited about the accelerating pace of innovation across the Digital Media business and pleased with the adoption of AI functionality as well as its early monetization across Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, including our flagship applications, Firefly Services and Express. We’re pleased to raise our annual net new ARR target to $1.95 billion and excited to deliver on our rich product roadmap in the second half.” With AI profitability driving the second-quarter earnings season, investors were naturally ecstatic and sent the stock higher. However, the June respite would be short-lived as the shares tanked by 13.4% in September. As usual, AI was the culprit. The downward trend started in the form of a 9.2% drop in after-market following the firm’s third-quarter report. It saw the company guide Q4 revenue at a midpoint of $5.525 billion which fell below the $5.61 billion analyst consensus. While this firm is a consumer and professional software stock, the broader software as a service (SaaS) industry hasn’t been spared by the AI-driven Wall Street trends either. SaaS and software stocks are predominantly valued through two metrics: the Rule of 40 and EV/Sales (or variants such as EV/EBITDA or Price to Sales). These multiples are somewhat unique to the software and SaaS stock narrative as they evaluate the firms based on their ability to grow. This is key since one of the main reasons behind SaaS stock popularity is that they do not have to deal with inventory, logistics, or supply chain issues like other businesses. In the AI era, SaaS valuation multiples and revenue growth estimates have been severely compressed. Data shows that the median price to forward sales SaaS multiple is 5.5x right now. The valuations are driven by lower growth expectations. After AI and the decimation ushered in by high interest rates, just 1% of SaaS and software companies have a 12-month future revenue growth rate higher than 30% as of June 2024. Digging deeper, investors have also placed a higher premium on growth as while firms with a Rule of 40 score greater than 40 have a median EV/Sales multiple of 8.9x, those with a growth rate greater than 30% but a Rule of 40 score lesser than 40 have a median multiple of 11.6x. These AI-driven software shifts, precipitated by worries of a reduction in SaaS demand due to businesses self-developing software using AI have also affected investor sentiment. According to Jefferies’ latest Trading Positioning Survey, 19% of institutional investors were overweight on software stocks as of October 2024, a sharp drop over July’s reading of 28% and January’s 51%. Yet, investors have also tempered their short positions as Jefferies shows that 54 software stocks were shorted as of October compared to 73 in July. Our Methodology To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded software short positions, we ranked the top nine crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An international stock trader intently watching the markets on a floor of monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 44 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 4.36% Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is a data analytics software provider that caters to the needs of the public and private sectors. It is one of the best-known players in the national security software market, and the firm has also been growing its presence in the US commercial market. On the commercial front–and particularly in today’s AI era–Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) benefits from the fact that it has set up teams that work directly with customers to assess their needs and develop specific solutions. This is important for software firms particularly in the AI era as firms might find it difficult to tailor AI to their specific needs. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)’s approach has yielded results as well since the software company grew its commercial revenue by 70% in the second quarter. This was on the back of lucrative deals, with Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) adding 96 contracts worth more than $1 million each and 27 contracts worth more than $10 million each. Scout Investments mentioned Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The top contributor to return for the quarter was Palantir Technologies. Sentiment improved on Palantir after it reported stronger than expected commercial customer revenue and free cash flow. U.S. commercial growth was especially encouraging, as U.S. commercial revenue was up by a large percentage year over year for the fourth quarter and U.S. commercial customer count grew nearly as much. We expect Palantir to become one of the premier artificial intelligence (AI) software providers, built on its Foundry and AIP platforms.” Overall PLTR ranks 2nd on our list of crowded software shorts according to Jefferies. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Long Bitcoin, Short Bonds: The New Billionaire Investors’ Strategy

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 30: Larry Fink on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on ... [+] November 30, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times) Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as an alternative to the fiat money system, and it increasingly embraces this role. In what may be the clearest signal of the bitcoin-fiat rivalry, more billionaire investors are turning to bitcoin as a hedge. Wall Street titans Larry Fink (BlackRock), Stanley Druckenmiller (Duquesne Family Office), and Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corporation) have recently voiced their skepticism over U.S. monetary policy. At the same time, they acknowledge bitcoin as a modern-day substitute for gold, with real potential to shield their portfolios against inflation. Yes, inflation expectations persist, despite the official reports of a 2.4% inflation rate in September. These legendary investors warn that inflationary government policies and the escalating national debt may prolong inflation beyond current forecasts. This would make bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, an attractive diversification asset. Speaking last week at Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative, Larry Fink reaffirmed his expectations for lasting inflation. BlackRock's CEO believes that "we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen" due to the governmental inflationary policies. He added that we’re not going to see interest rates as low as forecasted, predicting only a modest 0.25% rate cut this year. Such an environment is not the best for investing in government bonds. Inflation will erode real returns, and with no sizable rate cuts, current higher-yield bonds won't appreciate enough to outperform. Stanley Druckenmiller takes an even more skeptical stance, openly betting against the Fed. "We shorted bonds the day the Fed cut 50 [basis points] because we thought it was a mistake," he said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month. The veteran investor is known for achieving an average annual return of 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital. He now notes that while the Fed is pushing a restrictive narrative, the market is signaling otherwise. “Equities at a record high, gold at a record high, GDP above trend, credit tight, bank earnings and forecasts look good... crypto going crazy. We don’t see any restrictions whatsoever.” Paul Tudor Jones tackled another persistent U.S. problem: the enormous $35 trillion national debt that seems to spiral out of control. The billionaire hedge fund manager told CNBC that inflation risks loom after November's election, as both Harris and Trump pledged to increase spending and cut taxes, worsening the debt outlook. Jones believes the only viable path forward is to inflate and grow out of the debt burden. This means maintaining low interest rates and allowing inflation to rise, "inflating away" the real value of debt. This would ease the debt burden while avoiding immediate austerity measures, notoriously difficult for any politician to implement. From this perspective, betting against bonds looks like a wise move indeed. However, does it mean that bitcoin can truly fulfill its role as an inflation hedge? The “digital gold” narrative is among bitcoin’s most famous ones. Yet, it is often challenged by people arguing that such a volatile asset cannot fulfill a safe haven role. In the past, this argument used to stand. Bitcoin volatility fluctuated between 50% and 140% in 2017-2020, but has since been on a steady downward trend. Since 2023, it has been ranging from 23% to 65%, making it comparable to equities and even gold. For context, the VIX (S&P 500 volatility index) has been 16-33% in recent years. The GVZ (CBOE gold volatility index) was 10-30%. As bitcoin adoption and its market cap grow, analysts expect the coin to experience fewer dramatic price swings. Bitcoin volatility from 2017 to 2024 compiled by The Block Skeptics also argue that bitcoin’s performance in past crises casts doubt on its reliability as a safe haven. At the peak of U.S. inflation in May-June 2022, when the Fed began raising rates aggressively, BTC dropped 55%. At the same time, risk-on equities of the S&P 500 fell by 15%, and the risk-off gold fell only by 6%. Market stress usually determines whether an asset is risk-on or risk-off. From this view, bitcoin has failed the test. However, it’s important to consider factors unique to the crypto market. In May 2022, the algorithmic Terra collapsed dramatically, wiping out $50 billion in valuation. Though not directly related to bitcoin, Terra’s crash caused significant reputational and financial damage to the crypto ecosystem, triggering a wave of bankruptcies. Another bitcoin particularity is its four-year halving cycle, which also affects its price dynamics. As investors grow more discerning, bitcoin may be seen as a standalone asset, less affected by the broader crypto market’s turbulence. Billionaire investors appear to have already grasped bitcoin’s subtleties and its potential as a hedge against inflation. Once an outspoken skeptic, Larry Fink now believes that "bitcoin is asset class in itself," considering it an alternative to other commodities like gold." Thus, he thinks that the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Under Larry Fink’s guidance, BlackRock’s bitcoin spot ETF has accumulated $28 billion in assets. In the words of the firm’s Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnik, bitcoin is an “emerging global monetary alternative." It is a “scarce, global, decentralized, non-sovereign asset” with no country-specific or counterparty risk. Mr. Mitchnik believes that these properties make bitcoin fundamentally different from risk-on assets. Paul Tudor Jones is even more direct: "I'm long gold. I'm long bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously under-owned, so I'm long commodities." As to Stanley Druckenmiller, he famously said in 2023: “I don’t own bitcoin, but I should.” It is unknown if the legendary investor owns any coins today. However, he did say that crypto could play a big role in a renaissance because "people just aren't going to trust the central banks." Whether bitcoin can truly hedge inflation is a question only time can answer. Unlike short-term investments, inflation hedges need decades to prove their effectiveness. So far, bitcoin has beaten inflation: in the past ten years, the U.S. dollar lost 33%, while BTC gained 22,208%. Whether this continues is anyone’s guess, but it seems as if Wall Street has made its decision. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

NEXT | Does the Pre-Release Tavern Brawl add enough value to Blizzard's He... World of Warcraft’s 20th Anniversary Celebration is well underway, and if you’re hoping to acquire all of the collectible items from the event then you’ve got your work cut out for you. It will cost you nearly 500 Bronze Celebration Tokens if you want to snag all of the mounts, pets, toys, and cosmetics. Luckily, the event currency rewards for many quests and activities has been significantly increased from the amounts given at the start of the event. We’re talking a 400-800% boost from week one, which should allow players to earn all the bronze they need without spending the next two full months trudging to Tanaris at every log-in.The blue post that came along with the drop rate buff explains that players should be able to get all the tokens they need by playing the content they enjoy. The result is that a massive amount of event currency drops from all of the weekly activities in The War Within. You can earn easy tokens from these events, now in higher quantities:10 for Weekly Quests in Dornogal – Delves, Call of the Worldsoul, Archive, Bonus Holiday weekly8 for the weekly activities around Khaz Algar – that’s the Theater Troupe, Awakening the Machine, Spreading the Light, Azj’Kahet Pact, Special Assignments, Khaz Algar world bosses, and Wax Collecting15 for killing Queen Ansurek in Nerub-ar PalaceIf you’re not opposed to switching over to your PVP gear, you can also grab 15 tokens from the Conquest and Rated PVP weekly and 8 from the Honor, War Mode, and Brawl weeklies.If you’re interested in the rewards but not the celebration itself, it is now possible to set foot in the event grounds just once — to spend all of the Bronze Celebration Tokens that you acquired back on Khaz Algar over several weeks of running end-game content that you were going to do anyway. However, you can speed things up by actually participating in the activities outside of the Caverns of Time.There is just the one daily quest, Celebrate Good Fun!, which rewards 3 tokens. There are also several weekly event quests, each of which also rewards 3 tokens:Event World BossesChromie’s CodexClassic Timewalking DungeonsDefeating Emperor Thaurissan in Blackrock DepthsEarning 500 Honor in Korrak’s RevengeOnce you have earned 100 tokens across all sources, you’ll unlock the Token Collector achievement. This will enable further tokens to drop from the repeatable event activities, including:Classic Timewalking Dungeon completionsTimewalking Blackrock Depths bossesEvent World BossesCodex of Chromie competitionsDaily quests in Korrak’s RevengeIn essence, the new buffs to the currency drop rate take the edge off of getting your first 100 tokens. There isn’t one best strategy for getting all of the bronze you’ll need as quickly as possible. Instead, you can keep to your play style and still earn enough currency for a respectable amount of anniversary souvenirs without getting stuck in a months-long event grind.Is the 20th anniversary celebration not really your thing? Just make sure you keep up on your Khaz Algar weekly checklist. Take advantage of the experience boost to level some alts, and don’t forget things you might have started skipping over if you’ve already out-geared the rewards (like Special Assignments). Well before the end of the event you’ll have enough bronze saved up to buy out the event vendors.Do you need a break from spelunking through the same old weekly activities from The War Within? Once you collect your first 100 tokens, it will be much easier to feel like you’re earning enough event currency just by timewalking, slaying out-of-time world bosses, and helping Chromie repair the damage from her timeway shenanigans (yet again).Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: 20th Anniversary, Bronze Celebration Token, Weekly Rewards, World Of Warcraft 20th AnniversaryAdvertisement The blue post that came along with the drop rate buff explains that players should be able to get all the tokens they need by playing the content they enjoy.

Title: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $30 billion, sets new record in 293 days

Full Content:
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit $30 billion in assets setting a new record of 293 days, showcasing rising interest in crypto investments. The milestone from BlackRock comes 10 months after the company launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Then, it was reported that BlackRock had traded $7.5 million shares within the first 10 minutes of launching. Now, BlackRock holds more than 417,000 Bitcoin, valued at $30.4 billion, according to iShares data. Taking to X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, said what BlackRock has achieved is an “all-time record,” adding “the old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal.” Also $IBIT has crossed the $30 billion mark in assets after monster flows and price appreciation yesterday. It hit this milestone in just 293 days, an all time record.

Unreal… pic.twitter.com/rUskhqhW7b — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 30, 2024 Balchunas also noted that Bitcoin ETFs could reach one million Bitcoin soon. At the time of publishing, the number sits around 983,000. If such a milestone is reached Balchunas believes that the combined spot Bitcoin ETFs could surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, which holds 1.1 Bitcoin, by mid-December. “That said, anything can happen, eg a violent selloff and all this is delayed albeit still inevitable,” he added. “On flip, if prices keep going up, Trump wins, we could see FOMO could kick in and it all happens faster. Stay tuned.” COUNTDOWN: US spot ETFs are scheduled to hit 1 million bitcoin held by next Wed and pass Satoshi by mid-December (before their first birthday, amazing). They've been adding about 17k btc a week.

Title: Bitcoin nears all-time high, but THIS concern rises – Is a pullback likely?

If investors cash out, BTC’s bull rally can likely lose momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] is on the verge of making history yet again in 2024. AMBCrypto recently reported that this week would be crucial for dictating BTC’s prospects, determining whether it would align with the cyclical trend and climb higher or lean toward the monetary outlook and decline. Well, looks like the king coin has taken the former path. On the 29th of October, the leading cryptocurrency surged past the crucial $70,000 mark, for the first time since June. It reached a peak of $73,620 on Binance—just over a hundred dollars shy of its all-time high of $73,777. At press time, BTC was exchanging hands at $72,350, up by approximately 2% over the past day. This impressive rally reignited bullish sentiment among investors. Yet, it also raised a pressing question: Will this breakthrough trigger a wave of profit-taking? Recent activity suggests potential sell-offs may be underway. According to Lookonchain, following Bitcoin’s surge past $71,000, a whale wallet holding 749 BTC (worth $53.23 million) became active after remaining dormant for 12 years. This whale originally accumulated BTC back in 2012 when Bitcoin was priced at just $11, totaling an investment of $8,151 at the time. Now, it has transferred out 159 BTC ($11.32 million). Another major player potentially preparing to cash out is the Government of Bhutan. Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that crypto wallets linked to Bhutan’s Royal Government moved $66.55 million worth of BTC to Binance. Notably, their last exchange deposit was four months ago, in early July. At the time of writing, Bhutan held 12.47K BTC, valued at $904.34 million. Source: Arkham Intelligence While sell-offs loom, BlackRock remained firmly committed to Bitcoin. As noted by Lookonchain, the asset management giant purchased another 4,528 BTC worth over $322 million on 28th October. Furthermore, in the past two weeks, BlackRock significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, adding 34,085 BTC to its portfolio. This addition was valued at approximately $2.3 billion. The latest purchase brought its holdings to 408,253 BTC, valued at a staggering $29.09 billion, signaling strong institutional interest in the asset. Despite Bitcoin’s remarkable price performance, retail appeared to be sleeping on the asset. Google Trends data revealed that search interest for “Bitcoin” scored just 17 out of 100, last week. At press time, the value was slightly up at 23. Source: Google Trends Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s latest report indicated that retail participation was overshadowed by larger investors. While retail investors were gradually re-entering the market, their holdings, however, were growing at an unusually slow rate. Additionally, Bitcoin transfer activity among retail investors remained relatively low. Daily transfers totaled just $326 million on September 21, marking the lowest level since at least 2020. Historically, low transfer activity by retail investors often precedes price rallies for Bitcoin, a trend seemingly playing out now. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Therefore, as Bitcoin approaches record highs, the interplay between whales, institutes, and retail could shape its short-term trajectory—one that may set the stage for either unprecedented highs or a profit-taking pause.

Title: Florida CFO advocates adding Bitcoin to state pension funds for strategic growth

Patronis champions Bitcoin as a hedge and diversifier for Florida pensions, aligning with DeSantis's anti-CBDC stance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has urged the State Board of Administration (SBA) to consider adding Bitcoin to the state pension funds. On Oct. 29, Patronis sent a letter to Chris Spencer, the executive director of the Florida State Board of Administration, highlighting Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.” He emphasized how Bitcoin could diversify the state’s portfolio while offering a protective hedge against the volatility of other major asset classes. Patronis stressed that protecting the financial stability of Florida’s pension funds for teachers, police officers, and firefighters requires securing the best possible returns. He argued that Bitcoin could be a strategic addition, offering a compelling opportunity within the crypto sector. The CFO pointed out that his proposal aligns with Governor Ron DeSantis’s stance against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which contrasts with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to him: “[Bitcoin] is the antithesis of a central currency, providing decentralized digital currencies managed on blockchain technology, not issued or controlled by any government agency.” Considering this, Patronis asked the SBA to prepare a report analyzing the feasibility, risks, and benefits of investing state retirement funds into Bitcoin. He suggested that this report would help lawmakers make informed decisions ahead of the next legislative session. Patronis added: “The State Board of Administration maintains a Florida Growth Fund that allows for more innovative and emerging investments, and a Digital Currency Investment Pilot Program could be a perfect fit, offering potential benefits we cannot afford to overlook.” As of Jan. 2024, the Florida Growth Fund has authorization to allocate up to 1.5% of the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund toward high-growth investments. This fund invested around $998 million from 2022 through 2023. Patronis noted that other states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, have started investing a small percentage of their pension funds in crypto. Earlier this year, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board invested $164 million to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offered by Grayscale and BlackRock. Similarly, the State of Michigan Retirement System owns around $6.6 million shares in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Influence Media Partners is disrupting the music industry by not just investing in but actively managing high-value music catalogs and has raised $750 million for two funds and is currently raising for its third fund. Founder Pizarro is a seasoned music and entertainment strategist who gained extensive experience working with Fortune 50 companies. In her role at RPM, she negotiated transformative music partnerships with artists, record labels, and songwriters. Influence Media focuses on diverse artists with the potential to create enduring cultural impact. The firm targets active artists and songwriters with a history of engaging their fans and creating music across various genres who want to continue building their legacy and intellectual property. ““Lylette is a force that brings a sense of power and prestige to a songwriter in my shoes,” describes Nicolle Galyon, Grammy Nominated singer, songwriter and producer. “Having her invested in my copyrights and my creativity gives me a posture that I didn’t previously have.” For many folks investing in music, “it is just a buy and sell strategy," Pizarro explained. "The way Influence has thought about it is invest and build—invest, partner, and build. We're in constant dialog with the managers and artists directly, and thinking about new ways to unlock value, which is truly different to the marketplace." This commitment to partnership and building value sets Influence Media apart. Rather than simply acquiring catalogs and waiting for returns, the company leverages its team's expertise to actively enhance the value of its music properties through strategic marketing and brand building. This approach, combined with a strong emphasis on diversity and strategic alliances, has enabled the company to identify a unique position in the industry. Pizarro's deep understanding of the evolving music rights landscape honed over 20 years in the business, has been key to the company's success. She recognized a shift in the market and saw an opportunity to build a new platform that champions the artists and holds their catalogs. Influence Media’s unique approach has attracted significant investment from industry heavyweights like Warner Music Group. "Lylette has a fresh and thoughtful approach to acquiring and working culturally and commercially impactful catalogs which is delivering real results,” said Temi Adeniji, Managing Director of Warner Music Africa and SVP of Sub-Saharan Africa at Warner. “We're collaborating on exciting projects with artists as varied as Enrique Iglesias, Future, and Tainy, who have all placed their trust in Lylette and her team to help build their musical legacies." The firm also attracted investment from BlackRock. “Lylette's vision for the industry, ability to create meaningful and long-lasting relationships, and unyielding work ethic underpin her success,” explained Paul Braude, chief investment officer and head, direct private opportunities at BlackRock. These partnerships provide crucial financial backing and strategic support, enabling the company to expand its portfolio and reach. Warner Music Group, in particular, was instrumental in establishing early credibility and trust for the first-time fund. Since its launch, Influence Media has achieved remarkable growth. The company has secured $750 million in funding, expanded its portfolio across diverse genres with catalogs from artists like Enrique Iglesias and Blake Shelton, and launched new ventures like SLANG, a frontline label and publisher focused on artist development. Slang has signed Will Smith, Future, Truththebull and RaiNao along with Grammy-winning producers such as 30 Roc and Camper who have worked with the likes of Big Sean, Mary J. Blige, Cardi B, and Roddy Ricch. Lylette Pizarro, founder and co-managing partner at Influence Media Partners, Lex Borrero, a ... [+] prominent music executive, producer, and co-founder of NEON16, and Melissa Vargas, Brand Manager at Parkwood Entertainment attend Influence Media toasts René McLean at GRAMMY Week at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on February 02, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. Fundraising for a new venture is always challenging, and Influence Media was no exception. The team pitched their vision to 200 investors, a testament to their dedication and perseverance. As a first-time fund manager, Pizarro lacked the established track record that institutional investors typically seek, making the process even more difficult. To overcome this, she strategically assembled a team with a unique blend of expertise in both music finance and traditional investment. This ensured that her strategy was clearly articulated and her execution plan was solid, increasing the confidence of potential investors. The Influence Media management team boasts a wealth of experience besides Pizarro’s. Co-managing partner Lynn Hazan brings 25 years of experience as CFO at Sony Music Group, while partner Rene McLean has a strong background and creative experience in music and entertainment strategy and licensing. Founding advisor and investor Jon Jashni offers expertise in media investment and content production while Danny Klotz, head of underwriting, possesses deep experience in finance and analytics. “Making sure that the investment team was both a mix of music FP&A [financial planning and analysis] and classic investor DNA was critical,” Pizarro explained. This diverse team was laser-focused on strategically investing in music rights, differentiating themselves in a crowded marketplace filled with institutional capital. Their strong point of view on recorded music and songwriter rights, combined with a clear articulation of their strategy, helped them stand out. Pizarro also had to overcome the hurdle of being a woman and a minority—Latina—in a predominantly male industry. “Her [Lylette] drive is matched only by her passion for music and by the care she has for those around her, whether it be the team she has built at Influence, the partners for whom she delivers or the artists with whom she partners, said Pam Chan, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Mosaic at Lingotto.” Influence Media is a diverse company, with women and minorities comprising a significant portion of its leadership. “We were 66% female leadership and 66% diverse,” Pizarro shared. Perhaps because of this, Pizarro and her team faced skepticism and questions about their ability to succeed. However, they persevered and ultimately secured major investments. “Ultimately, we found the right partners, and they have been fantastic partners to us,” Pizarro affirmed. These strategic partnerships not only provided financial backing but also enhanced the firm's credibility, demonstrating to other investors that Influence Media could achieve its ambitious goals. Warner Music Group's involvement, in particular, signaled trust and credibility, while BlackRock's investment brought significant financial weight and further solidified the company's industry standing.

Title: Could Political Betting Swing The US Election?

Time Published: 2024-10-30T05:42:45Z

As the 1549 papal conclave dragged on into a second and third month, Venice's ambassador to the Vatican, Matteo Dandolo, was outraged by insider trading. “It is more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll,” he said, “and that the cardinals' attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands.” Although the conclave was supposedly secret, Roman traders ran a thriving market in the streets around the Vatican trying to predict the winner. Odds shifted rapidly, and bettors appeared suspiciously well informed and perceptive. Everyone knew the race was wide open, and the original favorite in the crowded field, at 5-to-1 against (or 17% odds), was Cardinal Giovanni Maria del Monte. Ten weeks later, he was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate, but only after opposing cardinals had brought forward a parade of options. Bettors on the streets helped the population understand who was leading, and by spotting early on that Julius might be the inoffensive candidate who would provoke the least opposition, they even guided the cardinals as they tried to break the deadlock. Prediction markets grew so widespread and so disliked that by the end of the 16th century, Pope Gregory XIV had outlawed them. The penalty for betting on the identity of the next pope was excommunication. Five centuries later, the urge to bet on elections has not abated. Neither has the whiff of corruption surrounding them, nor the sense that bettors' money can move not just markets but election results themselves. For centuries there have been cycles of political betting — in 19th century Pall Mall clubs, and in the early 20th century on the floors of the New York and London stock exchanges — punctuated by moves to ban them. As the 2024 presidential campaign drives towards a bitter conclusion, the cycle is repeating. This time the ultimate authority is not the pope but the US Supreme Court. At present, the US's biggest political betting markets are offshore. The only legal, regulated entities are nonprofits run as academic experiments with tight limits on how much can be wagered — the best known are the Iowa Electronic Markets and PredictIt.com, which operates in the US under the auspices of Victoria University in New Zealand. Now, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission is fighting an attempt to set up a legal onshore political futures market, which would allow Americans to take part without limits on how much they can trade. In the latest round, the for-profit Kalshi futures market won a stay against the CFTC's ban that cleared the way for a huge experiment. The litigation could go on for years, but Kalshi can run a market on this year's election, and its odds now appear in huge neon lights above Times Square. This has prompted established brokers to get in on the act; Interactive Brokers also launched political futures trading for the election. The world's richest man is paying attention. Earlier this month, Elon Musk urged his followers on the online platform X, which he owns, to follow the offshore venue Polymarket (launched by his former colleague Peter Thiel). “More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line,” he wrote. At the time, Polymarket showed Donald Trump's chances at 50.1%. Hours later, and with no relevant news, a still-anonymous French investor made the first of a series of giant trades now totaling some $45 million on a Trump win, pushing his odds way up. Ten days later, with Kamala Harris still ahead in polls of polls, Trump's chances had surged to 62.2%. PredictIt, populated mostly by academics limited to stakes of $850, also raised Trump's chances, but at a much slower pace. The press was more interested in Polymarket. Since Musk's tweet it has featured in 10 times more news stories than PredictIt. Polymarket's odds helped change the narrative in markets where far more money is at stake. Treasury yields and share prices both rose, as traders started pricing in a Trump win and the corporate tax cuts that would come with it. The Problem of Reflexivity Like all markets, popular prediction markets are prone to what the hedge fund manager George Soros calls “reflexivity.” Rather than just reflecting or reacting to facts on the ground, moves in bonds, stocks or oil markets can actually change that reality. It is this fear that animates opposition to Kalshi. The pressure group Better Markets, an amicus in the CFTC's suit, asserts that manipulating these markets could shift the facts. Cantrell Dumas, its director of derivatives policy, says that if the markets are taken seriously and show that one candidate is likely to win “people could stay home and not vote for their preferred candidate.” On the other side, Kalshi's supporters argue that manipulation is a problem for all markets, and the key is regulation. David Mason, general counsel of PredictIt and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission argues, “these manipulation problems are dealt with in regulated markets every day. There are trading exclusions; if they have material non-public information then they are prohibited from trading. Kalshi has a long list of people who aren't allowed to trade.” But Dumas rejects the comparison. “In a traditional market, if a regulator sees manipulation and takes action, it has remedies. With election manipulation that changes the result, that's irreparable harm. It's a fundamental distinction,” he told me. The excitement since Musk's tweet looks very much like reflexivity in action. And social change has amplified the potential reflexive power of markets. We are now far more inclined to trust in the “wisdom of crowds.” Most importantly, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, developed in the 1950s and the basis for much modern finance, holds that markets continuously incorporate all information, and so they can't be consistently beaten, except by insiders who know something others don't. Central to the argument for investing passively in indexes and exchange-traded funds, this idea can transmogrify into a belief that markets can't be wrong. Historically, political betting is impressively accurate. The academics Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz demonstrated 20 years ago that over history, markets had come closer to getting presidential elections right (with an average error of 1.5%) than the Gallup poll, which was on average off by 2.1%. Market discipline should help experts thrash out a better consensus estimate, and many companies now run internal prediction markets to improve forecasting. Wikipedia and Google have convinced us that crowd-sourcing information can work, and popular culture is saturated with tales of brilliant statisticians, like Michael Lewis' 2003 book Moneyball on how the Oakland A's used statistics to spot good players others had missed. Nate Silver, an adviser to Polymarket, made his name as a baseball statistician. Then there's what Wall Streeters call the Elaine Garzarelli Effect: We tend to place excessive trust in whichever guru made a good call last time. As a Lehman Brothers investment strategist, Garzarelli brilliantly urged clients to get out of the stock market the week before the Black Monday crash in 1987. That made her one of the most widely quoted strategists on the Street; her words would move markets, and she compiled a good track record. But she was fallible — in December 2007, on the eve of the global financial crisis, she proclaimed that stocks were undervalued by 25% — and people lost interest. In politics, the offshore Intrade prediction market developed a Garzarelli effect after calling 49 states correctly in 2008, and then all 50 — amid much attention — in 2012. Then regulators shut it down, but other venues rose to replace it. The market odds on a Donald Trump victory were about 35% on election night in 2016. Betting markets may also have grown more reflexive because the legalization of sports betting has made gambling socially acceptable, while investing looks ever more like gambling. Baseball banned Shoeless Joe Jackson and Pete Rose for life over wagering on the sport. Now, Major League Baseball has its own formal spread-betting partner. Investment apps now resemble video games: Robinhood.com drove the meme stock craze of 2021 as people poured stimulus checks, and a lot of political anger, into bets on companies like GameStop Corp. While papal envoys disdained people betting in the street, our current society has little problem with people trading elections on their phones. Reflexivity is amplified by a constant of human nature; our psychological need for an anchor. We want a number, and once we have one we cling to it, because it gives us an illusion of control. The idea of anchoring has been a staple of behavioral finance since it was first applied to economics by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky 50 years ago. Their experiments showed that people's answers to numeric questions can be skewed just by showing them a number at random before they answer. In the unmoored climate of a polarized election that appears to be in a dead heat, our desire for an anchor will naturally grow. In the UK's Brexit referendum, betting markets put the chances that Britons would vote to leave the EU at one in five. Statisticians David Rothschild and Andrew Gelman argued afterwards that there was “a feedback mechanism whereby the betting-market odds reify themselves.” People distrusted polls, they said, but “we do watch the prediction markets, which all sorts of experts have assured us capture the wisdom of crowds.” Pollsters and pundits — and even the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage — were “to some extent anchoring themselves off the prediction odds,” and dismissed polls that showed Brexit in the lead. The clue, Rothschild and Gelman argued, was that a “mature prediction market should show measured, but real, swings in prices in response to news,” but the Brexit odds stayed weirdly stable. Polls closed with the market odds of Brexit at 31%. When they were proved wrong, the pound dropped by more than 10% in a matter of minutes — more than treble its previous worst fall. Brexit looks very much like a classic example of Soros' reflexivity at work — and on the face of it, suggests that the CFTC is amply justified in trying to keep political betting out of mainstream investment. Self-Fulfilling Prophecies The CFTC's problem is that the other markets it regulates exist to help manage risks, from fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates to the possibility of a catastrophic hurricane. Investors wish to insure against political surprises — with the fallout from the Brexit vote showing why they might be sensible. So how to allow that, while limiting the chance of either deliberate manipulation or innocent irrational exuberance which, with reflexivity, could turn markets into a tool for changing election results? There are two plausible solutions. The first, advocated by Kalshi and Polymarket, is to make markets liquid by attracting more money. With billions at stake, no individual can move the market. But for now, while they remain on a smaller scale, whales can make a big splash. The alternative is to limit liquidity. PredictIt's $850 limit on stakes thwarts whales. A rich person's views don't count for more just because they're rich. But it's harder to move the price when genuine news happens, and it reduces the market's usefulness as a place to manage risk. Limited markets might produce the public good of more robust predictions, but a multi-trillion dollar manager like BlackRock cannot hedge a given election result on PredictIt. Recent experiences with opening new markets have shown how difficult this can be. In the decade before the global financial crisis, quants spotted that emerging markets and commodity futures tended to gain over time, with a low correlation to stocks and bonds. That sounded like the holy grail for asset allocators, and big institutions piled in. Once they did so, however, they changed the way these markets behaved and interacted. If money moved into copper as a result of a deliberate decision to move out of bonds, for example, it was inevitable that bonds and copper would grow more correlated, which they did. In 2008, stocks, commodities and emerging markets all crashed together. Similarly, once big financial hedgers and/or wealthy individuals arrive in betting markets, there's no reason to assume those markets will keep behaving the same way. Treasury bonds, oil or tech stocks are deep markets combining people with many different motivations, and the messages they send should be taken very seriously; Kalshi, Polymarket and others are far from that scale. There's also the eternal issue of Garbage In, Garbage Out. Markets synthesize information and give participants an incentive to sniff out fake news. But they aren't a protection against bad information — if the polls are wrong, markets will be wrong. If well regulated, political prediction markets might yet provide probabilities that help guide us in times of uncertainty. But like all markets they will be prone to get things wrong, and while they remain largely unregulated, it behooves us to be careful. The threat of excommunication doesn't deter miscreants the way it once did. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. The crypto market has reflected a bullish trend, with significant price growth over the past week. Moreover, digital assets inflows hit $901 million for the week ending October 25. The recent boom pushed the inflow volume to $27 billion year-to-date (YTD), almost tripling the 2021 record. Meanwhile, the US leads with $906 million in asset inflows for the week. The US political election is driving bullish market sentiment, with Bitcoin posting inflows of over $920 million. The digital assets market recorded a boom for the week ending October 25, with net asset inflows reaching $901 million, according to CoinShares weekly report. Moreover, the growth has pushed crypto assets’ year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $27 billion, almost three times the value recorded throughout 2021. Further, the report revealed that Bitcoin amassed about $920 million in weekly inflows, with the upcoming US political elections driving the market boom. CoinShares reported: “We believe that current Bitcoin prices and flows are heavily influenced by US politics, with the recent surge in inflows likely linked to the Republicans’ poll gains.” Meanwhile, the US witnessed the biggest weekly inflows of about $906 million, a sharp contrast to other regions. Germany and Switzerland followed in the second and third positions with net inflows of $14.5 million and $9.2 million. Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong posted net outflows of $10.1 million, $3.6 million, and $2.7 million. On a month-to-date (MTD) basis, digital assets have posted $3.32 billion in inflows this month. This marks October as the fourth-largest month in 2024 in terms of inflows. Bitcoin’s YTD and MTD inflows now stand at $25.46 billion and $3.27 billion as of the week ending October 25. Also, BTC-related investment products boast a whopping $78.99 billion in assets under management (AUM). Solana-based investment products followed Bitcoin with the second-largest inflows of $10.8 million last week. Their MTD and YTD flows amounted to $17.9 million and $69.2 million. Blockchain equities also followed the week’s trend of positive flows, posting $12.2 million in net inflows. On the other hand, Ethereum saw net outflows of $34.7 million for the week. However, its YTD record highlights net inflows of $748 million. For ETFs, BlackRock iShares’ IBIT maintained its lead with weekly inflows of $1.16 billion. The product boasts over $28 billion in assets under management (AUM). In contrast, Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB posted the largest outflows of 206 million for the week. Cumulatively, the 12 US-based ETFs have about $78.9 billion in AUM. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price surged to over $70,000 on October 28. Your email address will not be published.

Rising cloud revenue for AlphabetGoogle-parent Alphabet's third-quarter earnings beat expectations. The company's quarterly revenue was $88.27 billion, up 15% year on year, boosted by its cloud division's 35% jump in revenue from a year ago. Google's search and advertising revenue also grew. Net income was $26.3 billion, 33.5% higher than the year-ago quarter. Reddit swings to profitReddit shares surged almost 25% in extended trading Tuesday, breaking the $100 barrier for the first time, on the company's better-than-expected third-quarter results. Notably, Reddit turned profitable in the third quarter with net income of $29.9 million, compared with a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago. Mixed marketsOn Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.78% to close at a new high and the S&P 500 added 0.16%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.36%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.57%. Earnings results from European companies were mixed, causing trading in the region to be choppy. End of zero interest rates eraLarry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower rates only once, by 25 basis points, for the rest of this year because of high "embedded inflation," Fink said at a panel Tuesday. At the same event, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said the era of zero interest rates and zero inflation is over. [PRO] Citi likes these small-cap stocksThe Russell 2000 has gained around 10.4% so far this year. While that trails the S&P 500's 22% increase in the same period, both analysts and investors are paying more attention to small-cap stocks. As the Fed cuts interest rates, small-cap stocks tend to benefit more — and these are the small-cap stocks Citi thinks are good buys. A day in the life of an average office worker: Those behaviors are so ingrained in most of us that they're almost automatic and essential. It's not too surprising, then, that the companies behind those services – Snap, Reddit and Alphabet – reported third-quarter results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Their revenues, in particular, are bright spots. For its third quarter, Alphabet's advertising revenue increased 10.4% year on year. While Snap and Reddit didn't report their advertising top line specifically, there were indications both companies are also doing well in that area. Snap's total active advertisers have more than doubled from the year-ago quarter, according to CEO Evan Spiegel. That's coupled with two million more global daily active users than expected. More advertisers and more eyeballs mean more revenue per ad. Meanwhile, Reddit swung from a loss a year ago to earning a profit. That remarkable transformation was in part helped by a 47% year-over-year jump in daily active users and better-than-expected average revenue per user. All companies reported earnings after the bell. In extended trading, shares of Reddit rocketed almost 25%, Snap surged around 10.6% and Alphabet added 5.8%. It's Meta's and Microsoft's turn to report earnings later today. Microsoft isn't really involved in the ad market because it's more focused on enterprise products. But investors will be watching to see if Meta keeps up with the positive trend so far. Judging by how much time I spend on Meta-owned Instagram and see ads that seem to know exactly what I want, the company's ad revenue is likely to see healthy growth as well. — CNBC's Julia Boorstin, Jonathan Vanian and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

Title: BlackRock in talks to buy private credit firm HPS, Bloomberg News reports

Full Content:
(Reuters) -Asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has emerged as the sole bidder in talks to acquire private credit firm HPS Investment Partners, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the discussions. The parties are seeking to reach an agreement by the end of this year, the report said, adding that HPS may pursue an initial public offering or a minority stake sale if the parties cannot reach an agreement on valuation. HPS would target a post-IPO valuation of $11 billion, with plans to seek a premium above that figure in a sale, the report said. BlackRock and HPS Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. BlackRock, which manages more than $10 trillion, is seeking to capitalize on a boom in investor demand for alternative assets, which includes anything from private equity to infrastructure. HPS Investment Partners is a global investment firm managing assets across debt, liquid credit including syndicated leveraged loans, asset-based finance and real estate, according to its website. It had about $117 billion of assets under management as of June 2024. Earlier in July, BlackRock agreed to buy UK data firm Preqin for 2.55 billion pounds ($3.32 billion) in cash. Later in September, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved BlackRock's $12.5 billion deal for Global Infrastructure Partners. ($1 = 0.7686 pounds)

Microsoft, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX have announced the formation of the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at raising $30 billion in equity capital for AI infrastructure investments. This fund has the potential to mobilize up to $100 billion when including debt financing, making it one of the largest alternative investment funds ever raised. The scale of this investment underscores the magnitude of the opportunity Microsoft sees in AI infrastructure. It also highlights the company's commitment to maintaining its position as a leader in the AI race, not just through software innovation but through control of the underlying infrastructure that powers AI. The GAIIP will focus on investing in new and expanded data centers, as well as energy infrastructure to power these facilities, primarily in the United States. This strategic move by Microsoft expands the boundaries of AI competition beyond software and services into the crucial realm of infrastructure. By investing in the foundational elements of AI, Microsoft aims to enhance its cloud services, support its own AI development, and create a competitive advantage in the AI ecosystem. This infrastructure-based approach has proven successful for Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has leveraged its data center infrastructure to not only provide cloud hardware services but also to offer a wide range of software applications to customers. By controlling the entire stack - from the physical infrastructure to the software running on it - Microsoft can optimize its AI offerings for performance, cost-efficiency, and scalability. This vertical integration allows tighter control over the entire AI value chain, potentially leading to more innovative and competitive AI products and services. The profitability potential of this strategy is significant when blending data center infrastructure margins with software margins. While data centers require substantial upfront investment, the ability to layer high-margin software and services on top allows cloud providers to achieve considerable profitability. This initiative is expected to have far-reaching implications for the AI industry. It could intensify competition, potentially leading to industry consolidation as smaller AI companies may struggle to compete with the scale of infrastructure that Microsoft and its partners can provide. This move could create a significant distinction between companies like Microsoft, which are investing heavily in both infrastructure and software, and those focusing solely on software development in the AI space. Companies without access to such extensive infrastructure may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, potentially leading to a reshaping of the AI industry landscape. The GAIIP's focus on both data centers and energy infrastructure is particularly significant. Energy has emerged as the next critical frontier in the AI revolution, and the GAIIP recognizes this by including energy infrastructure in its investment strategy. As AI workloads become increasingly demanding, the need for powerful, energy-efficient data centers grows. By investing in energy infrastructure alongside data centers, Microsoft is addressing one of the key challenges in AI development: the massive energy requirements of AI computations. Data centers, the backbone of AI operations, are projected to consume an increasingly higher percentage of total U.S. electricity in the next decade. This surge in power consumption presents both a challenge and an opportunity. GAIIP’s approach not only ensures the scalability of AI technologies but also opens up opportunities for innovations in energy production, distribution, and management. Moreover, this investment strategy aligns with the growing trend of sustainability in technology. By focusing on energy infrastructure alongside data centers, Microsoft can potentially develop more environmentally friendly AI solutions, addressing concerns about the carbon footprint of AI technologies. By investing in new sources of power for these facilities, the partnership aims to create a more resilient and efficient energy ecosystem that can support the exponential growth of AI. The GAIIP aims to set a new standard for AI investments, positioning the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. As global demand for AI capabilities continues to surge, these investments will likely drive economic growth, create jobs, and foster innovation in the AI sector. It is important to emphasize that the capital required for AI infrastructure and energy needs surpasses what any single company or government can finance. This partnership is expected to advance technology while enhancing national competitiveness, security, and economic prosperity. In conclusion, Microsoft and BlackRock's partnership to create this $30 billion AI infrastructure fund represents a strategic expansion of the AI competitive landscape. By investing in the foundational infrastructure of AI, Microsoft is positioning itself to dominate not just in software and services but in the entire AI vertical stack. This move could reshape the AI industry, accelerate innovation, and solidify Microsoft's position as a leader in the AI-driven future of technology. The fund's commitment to energy infrastructure underscores the understanding that the future of AI is inextricably linked to advancements in energy technology, making it a crucial area for investment and development in the AI-driven economy.

Title: The Fed is likely to disappoint markets with just one more rate cut this year amid global inflation, BlackRock CEO says

The Federal Reserve will disappoint markets by cutting interest rates just one more time in 2024, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. Fink said the Fed will likely cut interest rates by 25 basis points before the end of the year amid a rise in global inflation. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25, but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said during a Tuesday panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The market sees two more cuts this year, pricing in a 25 basis point cut at the November and December meetings, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Investors see slimmer odds of about 30% that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in December. Fink pointed to inflationary policies in the US, which he said are changing the economy's consumer-driven nature. "We have a government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost,'" he said. "Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking." His comments point to the policies aimed at bringing supply chains closer to the US and "re-shoring" domestic manufacturing jobs via spending bills like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Those measures will likely mean inflation sticks around and prompts the Fed to pause its easing cycle, Fink suggested. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting." The latest inflation reading for September showed the consumer price index grew 2.4% year over year, down slightly from 2.5% in August, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After Fink's comments, another panel at the conference reaffirmed his forecast. When asked to raise their hand if they expected the Fed to cut interest rates twice more before the end of the year, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and other Wall Street giants kept their hands down, according to CNBC. The central bank kicked off its easing cycle with a jumbo 50 basis point cut last month. This week will be important for the Fed's decision-making process, with a slew of data releases scheduled, including personal consumption expenditures, third-quarter GDP, and the October jobs report.

Title: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-skyrockets-above-71000-key-reasons/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T16:30:50Z

The Bitcoin price has surged past the $71,000 mark today. Over the past five days, Bitcoin’s price has rallied by more than 8.5%, climbing from $65,600 to as high as $71,118 on October 29. In the last 24 hours alone, the BTC price has increased by 3.8%. This upward momentum can be attributed to four key factors: The surge in Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to substantial inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday witnessed massive ETF flows totaling $479.4 million. BlackRock led the inflows with $315.2 million, followed by Fidelity at $44.1 million, Ark with $59.8 million, and Bitwise at $38.7 million. These significant investments coincided with Bitcoin’s price movement from $68,000 to over $71,000. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin ETF inflows and CME Open Interest. He noted “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher, CME Open Interest is up, but not as much GBTC outflows are also minimal. We’re seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades.” The divergence suggests that investors are favoring direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs rather than engaging in cash and carry trades involving futures contracts. The carry trade strategy in the context of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures involves buying the ETF (tracking the spot price of Bitcoin) and simultaneously shorting Bitcoin futures on the CME. This approach aims to capitalize on price differences when futures trade at a premium to the spot price (contango). The notable shift toward ETFs indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, anticipating further price appreciation. Political developments are also influencing Bitcoin’s recent rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the impact of former President Donald Trump’s interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has gained over 32 million views and driven his Polymarket odds above 66%. Despite “crypto” being touted as the “Trump Trade,” Bitcoin’s correlation with Trump’s potential election victory seems to fuel the Bitcoin price rally. QCP Capital also noted that Bitcoin is up only 8% this “Uptober,” compared to an average of 21% in previous Octobers. They stated, “If spot holds at these levels, this October would mark Bitcoin’s fourth-worst performance in the past decade.” With total BTC perpetual futures open interest across exchanges standing at $27 billion—approaching this year’s peak—a breakout above $70,000 could trigger new all-time highs, especially with more leveraged longs joining in. Market data indicates a significant shorts squeeze contributing to Bitcoin’s price spike. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 65,622 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations across the entire crypto market amounting to $228.51 million. Of this, $169.47 million were short liquidations. Specifically for Bitcoin, $83.61 million in shorts were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $18 million. The substantial liquidation of short positions suggests that many traders were betting on a price decline and were forced to close their positions as the market moved against them. This mass unwinding of shorts can accelerate upward price movements as traders buy back into the market to cover their positions. Large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” are playing a pivotal role in the current rally. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet observed that Bitcoin’s rally continues, led by activity on the Binance exchange. He pointed out that Binance whales began significant involvement in the market two weeks ago during Asian trading hours, and recent declines in the Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) alongside price increases are “a clear sign of Binance whales’ intervention. Mignolet emphasized that this should not be interpreted as a decline in US demand, but an even stronger buying pressure from Binance. Over the past two weeks, demand for US Bitcoin spot ETFs has surged, with a net inflow of approximately 47,000 Bitcoin. Since most ETF products use Coinbase, movements in CPG data are closely tied to ETF demand. He concluded, “The current Bitcoin price is being driven by Binance whales, with sustained inflows of US capital.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,340.

Title: ‘Economic steel’: New Zealand’s Bitcoin opportunity, according to Michael Saylor

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor says the crypto currency presents an opportunity for New Zealand investors, and suggests domestic businesses should acquire it to boost their balance sheets. “It represents an extraordinary financial opportunity for people in New Zealand, and that’s kind of why I’m pleasantly surprised that you’re here,” MicroStrategy executive chairman Saylor told Markets with Madison in Washington DC. “The people that really need it [Bitcoin] are the global investors that are not in the major cities. “Because you can buy into the most scarce, desirable, global, digital property, and you’re getting the same investment proposition as a New York billionaire. “[New Zealanders] need it more. Trust fund babies in Manhattan don’t need it, they’ve got a lot of other [investment] options.” Saylor said investors like himself – who personally owned at least US$1.1 billion ($1.8b) worth of the crypto currency – were actively attempting to drive its price higher, meaning buyers of Bitcoin would stand to benefit. His Nasdaq-listed technology company was the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with more than 225,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet worth more than US$16b. Saylor suggested New Zealand businesses could follow his adoption playbook and acquire Bitcoin as a Treasury asset. “If you’ve got a company that’s a low-growth company, geared to the New Zealand economy, if you start to invest your balance sheet into Bitcoin, you are now with a 1% grower in New Zealand bolted on to a 50% high-growth, Big Tech, digital monetary network. “How many companies in New Zealand grow 20% a year for 10 years in a row? The odds are just about next to none. “But what are the odds of Bitcoin going up 20% a year? That’s actually my bear case.” Saylor expected Bitcoin to reach a price of US$13 million – it was currently about US$68,000. This year, financial institutions including BlackRock launched exchange-traded funds, offering investors exposure to the crypto currency through the stock market for a low fee. He believed Bitcoin’s next big moment – more listed companies or governments adopting Bitcoin – would be driven by banks accepting it as money in accounts or as collateral for loans. “Banking is just the next logical step,” Saylor suggested. “If you want to see all the people with the money and the power in the world embrace the asset, they will do it when their vendors support the asset. That’s a rippling thing.” Some Bitcoin investors were against Saylor’s suggestion banks should become more significant custodians of the asset because it would centralise a currency popular for its decentralised nature. In the interview he defended his position, arguing it increased the safety of the asset. “I think when the Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes, or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure. “When you have regulated, public entities like BlackRock and Fidelity and JP Morgan and State Street bank holding the asset, well, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms, they’re invested in those entities. “So, there’s no way all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets ... because that’s where all their retirement money is.” Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network had no central power controlling it and no central point of technological failure. Speaking to the characteristics of the Bitcoin network and its invention by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Saylor said it achieved scarcity and had an “immaculate conception”. “Satoshi launches it, walks away forever, disclaims beneficial ownership – it’s an immaculate conception.” The initial Bitcoin mined by Nakamoto to secure the network had not been sold, Saylor said. Bitcoin’s supply was capped at 21 million tokens, meaning it had an expected deflation rate, unlike fiat currencies issued by central banks that targeted an annual rate of inflation. While many other crypto currencies had been launched, Saylor said Bitcoin was clearly the winner. “It’s because all the smart money in the world decided that’s the winner. Did it have to be? Well, no. “It’s like, why do we speak English? Because all the rich, powerful people decided on English. Could it have been a different language? It could have been French.” Explaining why he believed Bitcoin was a superior asset, Saylor said it was “clean money”, akin to “economic steel”, compared with dirty money such as sovereign debt, which had a negative real yield after tax. “It’s like forcible chemotherapy for your healthy 14-year-old teenager,” he said of sovereign debt. “That’s the scourge, the burden of humanity that they’ve been hauling for thousands of years. “When you ask, ‘What is human progress, what elevated the civilisation?’, it’s technology.” Saylor himself was once against Bitcoin, comparing it to online gambling in a 2013 post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Acknowledging it, Saylor said: “Everyone’s against Bitcoin before they’re for it.” “I’m sure the first guy with fire scared a bunch of other tribesmen. No one wants to get burned. Yet without fire, we’re not better than the apes.” When asked why he bothered being so publicly bullish on Bitcoin, Saylor said he wanted to “fix the money”. “If the money is broken, all eight billion people have toxic capital. All 300 million companies have toxic capital.” Watch part one and two of Michael Saylor discussing Bitcoin and his company MicroStrategy on Markets with Madison in the videos above.
