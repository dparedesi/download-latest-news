Sputnik News 20251210 MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Negotiations on the Ukraine settlement revolve around discussions on three documents, namely a US-proposed peace plan, a security guarantees agreement, and an economic recovery plan for the post-conflict period, The Washington Post newspaper reported, citing US and Ukrainian officials. The talks remain far from concluded, the report said on Tuesday. Ukraine and its European allies plan to present further revisions to the plan on Wednesday, it added. Additionally, US officials are in discussions with Larry Fink, CEO of financial giant BlackRock, about reviving the company's proposal for a Ukrainian reconstruction fund that could raise $400 billion, The Washington Post reported. The World Bank may also be involved, the report said. Since mid-November, the US has been promoting a new peace proposal for Ukraine. On December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin received US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in the Kremlin. The US representatives' visit to Russia was related to the discussion of the US peace plan for Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said later that he was disappointed that Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not read the peace proposal for the Ukraine conflict. On Tuesday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that Witkoff and Kushner gave Zelenskyy "days" to come up with a response to the peace plan. Zelenskyy reportedly told his European allies that Witkoff and Kushner pressured him during a two-hour phone call on Saturday to respond to the plan that demands Kiev accept territorial losses in exchange for US security guarantees, with Trump aiming to finalize the deal "by Christmas."

Title: Ukraine Considers Legal Path To Elections Under Martial Law As US Pushes For Vote

By RFE/RL December 11, 2025 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he held a "substantive discussion" with members of Ukraine's parliament on the possibility of holding an election, amid pressure from the United States to hold a vote despite wartime legal restrictions. Addressing Ukrainians in a nightly video on December 10, Zelenskyy said strong security guarantees from Kyiv's allies -- especially Washington -- are needed to hold a vote. "If partners, including our key partner in Washington, speak so much and so specifically about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legal Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt," he said, responding to a suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Kyiv was using the war as an excuse to avoid elections. "It is not easy, but pressure on this issue is definitely not what we need...Security challenges depend on partners, primarily America. Political and legal challenges must be answered by Ukraine. And they will be," he added. The White House has been pushing for Ukraine to hold elections -- US President Donald Trump told Politico in an interview published on December 9 that "it's time"-- even though Ukraine's constitution doesn't allow for elections during wartime. In a shift from previous statements, Zelenskyy told reporters on December 9 that he would push parliament to draft legislation allowing for elections during martial law. A vote could follow in 60 to 90 days once there are security guarantees in place to make sure voting would be safe for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy's comments come amid intense negotiations aimed at ending Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Ukrainian officials have been pushing back on a US-drafted peace plan that was seen as heavily favoring Russia. The possibility of holding elections has been regularly dismissed, with officials saying it would be impossible given daily Russian air strikes across the country, thousands of soldiers battling on the front lines, and millions of Ukrainians displaced. Opinion polls show most Ukrainians are against holding wartime elections, though with the last elections held in 2019 some want changes in the government to bring in fresh ideas. Widely popular, Zelenskyy's support has slipped in recent weeks amid a major corruption scandal that led to the resignation of an influential adviser, Andriy Yermak. On the battlefield and in negotiations, Russian officials believe they have the upper hand, and the 28-point plan proposed by the United States echoes most of the hard-line positions that Moscow has held since before the invasion. Ukraine's European allies, meanwhile, have been unenthusiastic about Washington's proposal. Before a planned meeting between the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- which includes Germany, France, Britain -- with Zelenskyy on December 11, leaders from the three countries held a phone call with Trump. Trump said said he exchanged "pretty strong words" with the leaders of France, Britain and Germany over Ukraine, another sign of a widening rift on how to end the war as it nears its fourth anniversary. "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added, noting the European countries talked about meeting this weekend in Europe. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Ukraine had agreed on key points of a possible reconstruction plan in discussions with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior officials, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "The principles of the economic document are completely clear and we are fully aligned with the American side," Zelenskyy said. "An important common principle is that for reconstruction to be of high quality and economic growth after this war to be tangible, real security must be at the core. When there is security, everything else is there too." Zelenskyy wrote earlier that he and and his European partners will soon present the United States with "refined documents" on the peace plan as well. There have been several major sticking points in the back-and-forth negotiations including the size of Ukraine's armed forces, Western security guarantees, and Russia's insistence that Ukraine be permanently barred from seeking NATO membership. The White House peace proposal, and the belief that it heavily favors Russian interests, has drawn criticism from some Republican lawmakers in Congress. President Vladimir Putin "is mocking President Trump and buying time to keep killing Ukrainian families," Representative Joe Wilson said.

Title: Bitcoin dips after Fed’s 25 bps cut – Is BTC’s 2026 rally at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-dips-after-feds-25-bps-cut-is-btcs-2026-rally-at-risk/

Weak bids and macro volatility cloud Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. The market is taking the Federal Reserve’s move with cautious optimism. The recent 25 bps rate cut to 3.50–3.75% by the Fed on the 10th of December marks the third cut of 2025. Consequently, traders are now eyeing a potential liquidity boost, putting Bitcoin [BTC] back on the radar. But that’s not all. One key point in the Fed’s statement is that they’ll start buying $40 billion in U.S. T-bills over the next thirty days. By doing this, the Fed injects extra short-term liquidity back into the banking system. Source: X Simply put, the U.S. economy is about to get a fresh wave of liquidity. With another 25 bps rate cut and $40 billion in Treasury bill buys from financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is clearly trying to push cheaper capital back into the system as labor-market risks start creeping higher. And yet, BTC has reacted with a 2.14% dip, breaking below $90k. Notably, this move is no fluke. The Fed may be boosting short-term liquidity, but it’s also stirring concern about longer-term risks, especially as markets start pricing in a pause in rate cuts heading into 2026. It appears investors were already prepared for Bitcoin’s volatility. From mining firms to BlackRock, millions in BTC were unloaded ahead of the FOMC. With inflation still running hot and the Fed split on how aggressively to cut rates next year, investors are clearly staying cautious. And that caution isn’t misplaced. Over the last four FOMC meetings, Bitcoin has repeatedly pulled back. In fact, after the October FOMC, BTC slid almost 30% to $80k, marking its first major flash crash of 2025. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Against this setup, the question remains: Is history about to repeat itself? A recent Glassnode report highlights weak bids around $90k, reinforcing the cautious sentiment. Add aggressive selling by smart money, and Bitcoin is clearly in a supply-skewed setup, signaling potential downside pressure. Looking ahead, BTC’s base-building for a Q1 2026 rally is still uncertain. With investors reshuffling, macro volatility lingering, and weak FOMO, Bitcoin could repeat its post-FOMC breakdown, testing key support levels.

Title: State Street, Galaxy and Ondo join tokenized cash race with 24/7 sweep fund
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/state-street-galaxy-ondo-onchain-cash-sweep-solana
Time Published: 2025-12-11T08:52:34Z
Full Content:
State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are launching a tokenized private liquidity fund on Solana, with Ondo expected to invest $200 million. State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are joining forces with Ondo Finance on a tokenized liquidity fund that will push cash “sweep” balances directly onto public blockchains, creating a potential source of 24/7 onchain liquidity. The planned State Street Galaxy Onchain Liquidity Sweep Fund, or SWEEP, is designed to take in and pay out PayPal’s (PYUSD) stablecoin for accredited investors, the companies said on Tuesday. Ondo is expected to seed the fund with $200 million, tying a major tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer directly into State Street’s tokenization stack. The fund will be powered by Galaxy Digital infrastructure, while State Street Bank and Trust Company, an affiliate of State Street Investment Management, will act as custodian. SWEEP is set to launch on Solana in early 2026, with rollouts on other networks, including Stellar and Ethereum, to follow, using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Related: Solana and Coinbase’s Base connect together using Chainlink The move drops another heavyweight into an increasingly crowded race to define what “onchain cash” looks like for institutions. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already run tokenized cash‑management vehicles, including money‑market and other short‑term fixed‑income funds, on public blockchains. For its part, Ondo has built a business around wrapping Treasurys and other credit exposures into onchain vehicles that can plug into crypto markets. “By partnering with Galaxy, we will push the envelope together and drive the evolution of the TradFi landscape onchain,” said Kim Hochfeld, global head of cash and digital assets for State Street Investment Management. “Tokenization is rapidly becoming the connective tissue between traditional finance and the onchain economy,” said Ian De Bode, president of Ondo Finance. “Our planned investment would not only anchor this innovative fund – but also supports the continued growth of Ondo’s fund that offers institutional investors exposure to short-term US Treasuries with 24/7 instant mints and redemptions.” Related: Blockchain trial on Canton Network tests collateral reuse with tokenized US Treasurys The launch comes as tokenized funds and tokenized equities are starting to resemble components of an emerging onchain capital markets stack more than isolated pilots. Superstate opened up onchain capital raising for US Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered public companies via its Direct Issuance Programs on Ethereum and Solana Wednesday, targeting the equity side of that stack by letting issuers sell new stock directly for stablecoins and settle immediately to investor wallets. State Street’s partnership with Galaxy and Ondo also highlights how the roles are shaping up as traditional finance and crypto firms share the same products. State Street brings Big Four regulatory cover and custody, Galaxy contributes digital‑asset infrastructure and tokenization expertise, and Ondo provides both capital and an existing RWA distribution network. Related: Galaxy expands into UAE as part of Middle East push Solana’s role as the initial venue highlights a second competitive race unfolding beneath the product arms race. The chain has become a favored home for tokenized assets and high‑throughput trading, from tokenized public shares to experiments in onchain liquidity funds, as issuers look for lower fees and fast settlements. Some of the largest institutions in the world have chosen the Solana blockchain for their digital assets play, including Western Union, which processes over $100 billion in remittance volume every year, and Pfizer, which processes $2 trillion of merchant payment volume annually. Physical staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Solana have reached almost $1 billion in assets under management. Launching on Solana first, with plans to expand to Stellar and Ethereum, will allow SWEEP to tap into multiple ecosystems where stablecoins and RWA tokens are already part of the infrastructure.

Title: Americans barely own gold — and that means prices could climb even further, Goldman says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-price-today-us-ownership-upside-goldman-sachs-outlook-forecast-2025-12

Full Content:
Gold's record rally this year has grabbed headlines, but American investors barely own any of it, which means the yellow metal's price could have more room to run, according to Goldman Sachs. Even with gold hitting repeated highs, US ownership hasn't budged much. Gold ETF exposure is still six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, below its 2012 peak since the launch of gold ETFs in the mid-2000s, according to Goldman's analysis published on Wednesday. The low gold allocation is simply because "portfolio growth has outpaced gains in gold prices and volumes over the past decade," Goldman's analysts wrote. And while gold has surged to new all-time highs in 2025, Goldman's analysis shows that the rally hasn't translated into meaningful increases in actual US ownership. Gold ETFs make up just 0.17% of private US financial portfolios as of the second quarter — a microscopic slice of the roughly $112 trillion Americans hold in stocks and bonds, according to Goldman's analysis. Goldman's data also shows that fewer than half of large US institutions managing over $100 million hold any gold ETF position at all. Among those that do, allocations typically sit between 0.1% and 0.5%. For major long-term investors, only about 0.2% of their portfolios are in gold. Despite the social media buzz around Costco gold bars and US Mint coin sales, the report notes that physical gold demand in the US is tiny compared with ETF flows — just 11 to 15 metric tons year-to-date, versus roughly 400 tons of net ETF buying. That low ownership stands in sharp contrast to recommendations coming from major market voices, including Citi, UBS, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, advising investors to add gold to their portfolios. The gap between those recommendations and reality is exactly what Goldman says could push gold's next leg higher. The bank estimates that every 1-basis-point, or 0.01 percentage point, increase in gold's share of US financial portfolios would push gold prices up by about 1.4%. Goldman argues that if households or institutions meaningfully boosted their gold exposure as a diversifier — especially amid global macro uncertainty, including concerns about the fiscal outlook — such inflows could "substantially raise prices" in the small gold market. The bank forecasts gold to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, but says that forecast carries "significant upside risk" if private-sector buying broadens beyond the central banks that have dominated demand in recent years. The spot gold price hit a record high near $4,400 per troy ounce in late October and has since pulled back to around $4,220 per ounce. Prices are up 60% so far this year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto statue lands on NYSE in sign of changing times

Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:13:26Z

There are five other Satoshi statues made by Valentina Picozzi located around the world, in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam and Miami, in the US state of Florida. The New York Stock Exchange has become the sixth host of Valentina Picozzi’s “disappearing” Satoshi Nakamoto statue — a striking shift from just a few years ago when crypto was still taboo on Wall Street. Long seen as a bastion of traditional finance, the NYSE called the installation “shared ground between emerging systems and established institutions” in an X post on Wednesday. The statue was installed by Bitcoin (BTC) firm Twenty One Capital, which began trading this week. The design itself is the work of Picozzi, who wrote on X under her Satoshigallery handle that seeing her latest piece in such a high-profile setting is “mind-blowing.” “This is such an achievement, even in our wildest dream we wouldn’t think about placing the statue of Satoshi Nakamoto in this location! The 6th/21 statues of Satoshi Nakamoto found its home in the NYSE,” she added. It also happens to coincide with the anniversary of the Bitcoin mailing list, which Nakamoto launched on Dec. 10, 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, minting the first 50 Bitcoin in history and planting the seeds for the crypto industry we see today. Over a year later, on May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase of goods using Bitcoin, paying 10,000 Bitcoin for two Papa John’s pizzas. In the intervening years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency faced many challenges, as institutions and banks shunned them, and governments allegedly attempted to suppress them through efforts such as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. However, it has since turned a corner, as skeptics, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have changed their minds about the technology, and institutions and Wall Street have scrambled to invest through vehicles like exchange-traded funds and directly by holding Bitcoin in their treasuries. Public and private companies, countries and ETFs now collectively hold more than 3.7 million Bitcoin, according to Bitbo, worth more than $336 billion. Picozzi has five other Nakamoto statues around the world, located in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam, and Miami, Florida. Related: Disappearing Satoshi statue in Lugano took 21 months to create, says artist Picozzi, under her Satoshigallery handle, said she is committed to placing 21 around the world, a possible reference to the theoretical 21 million Bitcoin maximum supply. Speaking to Cointelegraph last year, she said Nakamoto is one of the most intriguing and fascinating figures of this era, and the statues stand as a tribute to the person behind Bitcoin. “The statue itself wants to give to the viewer this feeling of disappearance, and the sense that the inventor stays between the lines — as of today, Satoshi exists in the lines of the Bitcoin code, allowing humanity to have the first decentralized payment system,” she said.

Title: Ukraine sends US new plan to end the war as Trump blasts Europe

A man goes up the steps from an underground passage next to the memorial for the fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters on the Independence Square in Kiev, on Dec. 10, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) Ukraine has sent Washington an updated plan for ending Russia's invasion, Ukrainian officials told AFP Wednesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first U.S. plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kiev and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia's hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it "takes into account Ukraine's vision — it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues". "We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side," the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a U.S. plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kiev and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as "decaying" and "weak" on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new U.S. national security strategy said the continent risked "civilisational erasure". "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine's European allies put on a show of support for Zelensky as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest U.S. proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked "wasting time". "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added. "They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we'll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don't want to be wasting time". 'Let people fight it out' Talks between U.S. officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelensky, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader — who Trump has accused of not reading the plan — said on Tuesday the plan had been broken down into three documents — a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine's post-war recovery. Earlier on Wednesday, Zelensky said he had held an online meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine's recovery. "This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine," Zelensky said on social media. "We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment," he added. But U.S. leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. "Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don't," Trump said on Wednesday. "But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you're losing thousands of people a week. It's ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous." Online discussion site Reddit launched a legal challenge on Dec. 11 to Australia's social media ban for under-16s, just days after the landmark law came into effect. Türkiye’s current account posted a net surplus of $457 million in October, according to Central Bank data released on Dec. 12. A high-stakes showdown in Norway awaits as Brann hosts Turkish giant Fenerbahçe on Dec. 11, with both clubs battling for critical positioning in the UEFA Europa League league phase.

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Adam L Silverman| December 10, 20259:57 pm| 17 Comments This post is in: Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Military, Open Threads, Russia, Silverman on Security, War, War in Ukraine Just a quick housekeeping note: last night in comments, Gin & Tonic had a very good and important response to my remarks regarding whether Ukraine is losing. There’s not enough time tonight to get to the important strategic issue that it raises, which is how to win the war AND secure the peace. I will try to get to this tomorrow. Before we start, here’s Ukraine’s outgoing fires this evening/overnight: Ukrainian channels report that over 400 drones flew to Russia. [image or embed] — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 4:37 PM President Zelenskyy and Ukrainian leaders continue to go through the motions with the US to demonstrate that they’re not being obstructionist, which has led to the emergence of a twenty point proposal. The Ukrainians are doing this because they know that Russia has already rejected any agreement that doesn’t reward Russia by giving them everything Putin wants. Ushakov was quoted by Russian media on Sunday as saying that the United States would have to “make serious, I would say, radical changes to their papers” on Ukraine. He did not clarify what changes Moscow wanted Washington to make. The Kremlin has said it expects Kushner to be doing the main work on drafting a possible deal. David Ignatius provides the details at The Washington Post: The negotiating package involves three documents, a Ukrainian official told me: the peace plan, security guarantees and an economic recovery plan. The talks are far from over, with Ukraine and European supporters planning to release a joint set of amendments Wednesday. But here are some of the ideas being explored, as described to me this week by U.S. and Ukrainian officials: • Ukraine would join the European Union as early as 2027. This rapid accession worries some E.U. powers. But the Trump administration thinks it can overcome opposition from Hungary, which has been Kyiv’s biggest E.U. opponent. Membership would foster trade and investment. But perhaps most important, it would force Ukraine to control its pernicious culture of corruption in state-owned businesses. At bottom, this war has been about whether Ukraine can become a European country. President Vladimir Putin detests that idea, with his mystical belief in the oneness of Russia and Ukraine. Quick E.U. membership for Kyiv looks to me like victory. • The United States would provide what are described as “Article 5-like” security guarantees to protect Ukraine if Russia violates the pact. Ukraine wants the U.S. to sign such an agreement and have Congress ratify it; European nations would sign separate security guarantees. A U.S.-Ukrainian working group is exploring how the details would work — and how fast Ukraine and its allies could respond to any Russian breach. The reliability of the U.S. guarantees is arguably undermined by language in the National Security Strategy that seems to erode the NATO alliance, on which the guarantees are modeled. But the Trump team says it’s committed to continuing U.S. intelligence support for Ukraine, which is the sine qua non of security. • Ukraine’s sovereignty would be protected from any Russian veto. But negotiators still seem to be struggling with delicate issues like limits on Ukraine’s army. There’s talk of raising an initial U.S. proposal for a 600,000-soldier army to 800,000, which is roughly what Ukraine would have anyway, postwar. But Kyiv refuses any formal constitutional cap, as Russia wants. Whatever the nominal size of the army, officials say there might be supplements like the national guard or other support forces. • A demilitarized zone would be established along the entire ceasefire line, all the way from the Donetsk province in the northeast to the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Behind this DMZ would be a deeper zone in which heavy weapons would be excluded. This line would be closely monitored, much like the DMZ that divides North and South Korea. • “Land swaps” are an inescapable part of the deal, but Ukraine and the U.S. are still haggling over how the lines would be drawn. Russia demands Ukraine give up the roughly 25 percent of Donetsk it still holds; the Trump team argues that Ukraine is likely to lose much of that in battle over the next six months, in any event, and should make concessions now to spare casualties. U.S. negotiators have tried various formulas to make this concession more palatable for Zelensky. One idea is that the withdrawal zone would be demilitarized. Zelensky insisted Monday that he has “no legal right” to cede territory to Russia. One way to finesse this issue is the Korea model — to this day, South Korea claims a legal right to the entire peninsula and North Korea asserts the same. • The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, would no longer be under Russian occupation. Negotiators are discussing the possibility that the United States might take over running the facility. Strange as it may sound, that appeals to some Ukrainian officials because it would provide an American tripwire against Russian aggression. • The Trump administration would seek to foster investment and economic development in Ukraine. One source of funds would be the more than $200 billion in Russian assets now frozen in Europe. Trump’s negotiators already proposed making $100 billion of that stash available to Ukraine for reparations. The amount might be increased. More at the link. This is not just going to continue to be a non-starter for Ukrainians, we already know, as the quote above indicates, that anything other than full capitulation is unacceptable to Putin and Russia. Republican Congressman Joe Wilson noted that Ukraine agreed to all six proposals that Trump presented this year, while Russia did not support any of them.

Moreover, Trump has adopted a new demand as a result of his regular and ongoing phone calls with Putin: Zelenskyy has to go because Ukraine isn’t a democracy because they haven’t held elections during the war. ⚡️US needs ‘answers’ before next meeting with Zelensky, Trump says. Trump did not discuss specific conditions of the peace deal but said Zelensky needs to be “realistic” and asked when Ukraine would hold presidential elections. [image or embed] — The Kyiv Independent (@kyivindependent.com) December 10, 2025 at 5:32 PM From The Kyiv Independent: (emphasis mine) European officials want to arrange a meeting this coming meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and American leadership to discuss peace in Ukraine, but the White House first needs “answers,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on Dec. 10. Trump told reporters that he spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on Dec. 10. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words, and we’ll see what happens,” he said. “I mean, we’re waiting to hear answers.” According to Trump, the European leaders want to hold a meeting involving both him and Zelensky in Europe this weekend, but the White House requires further persuasion before agreeing to attend. “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with,” he said. “We don’t want to be wasting time.” Trump did not discuss the details of any proposed peace framework but said Zelensky needs to be “realistic.” He also mused aloud about Ukraine’s next round of presidential elections. “I think (Zelensky) has to be realistic and I do wonder about, how long is it going to be before they have an election,” Trump said. “It’s a democracy. It’s been a long time.” On the same day, Zelensky told reporters that Ukraine could be ready to hold elections during Russia’s full-scale war if the U.S. and European allies work to ensure security. Zelensky then said he discussed the issue with members of the Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 10. “I will not allow any speculation against Ukraine,” the president said in his evening address. “If our partners, including our key partner in Washington, talk so much and so specifically about the elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legitimate Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt.” Presidential, parliamentary, and local elections in Ukraine are banned under martial law, which went into effect after Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. While Kyiv has previously held firm on the need to postpone elections until the end of the war — or at least a ceasefire — Trump’s emphasis on elections in the latest push for a deal have brought about a shift. Polling also shows Zelensky’s popularity to have hit a low point in the fallout of a major corruption scandal that saw his second-in-command, Andriy Yermak, resign from office. Though Trump has expressed impatience with Ukraine for slow progress on a peace agreement, the Kremlin meanwhile has given no sign of easing its maximalist demands — including calls for Ukraine to cede territory it still controls. To sum up: “Biden gave Ukraine $350 billion. And you know what I gave them? Nothing.” — Trump. [image or embed] — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) December 9, 2025 at 4:00 AM And he hates Zelenskyy too: Here is President Zelenskyy’s address from earlier today. Video below, English transcript after the jump. 10 December 2025 – 20:52 I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! Today was an extremely busy day, and the coming days will also be serious. We spoke with the American team on economic matters – on reconstruction matters. I want to thank Secretary Bessent, Jared Kushner, and Larry Fink of BlackRock for being fully constructive. The key principle we share is that, to ensure reconstruction is of high quality and economic growth is tangible after this war, real security must form the foundation. When there is security, everything else follows. The 20 points for ending the war form a fundamental document. We are actively working on the key steps – and they must be doable steps. From this fundamental document, we are developing two additional ones – at least two. And the first is on security – regarding security guarantees for Ukraine with the United States, and the second is on the economy – covering reconstruction and joint investments. Today, we focused specifically on the economic document. And on the Ukrainian side, I was accompanied by Ukrainian government officials: Prime Minister of Ukraine Yuliia Svyrydenko, Deputy Prime Minister Kachka, Ministers Sybiha and Sobolev, and First Deputy Foreign Minister Kyslytsya. Our defenders were also represented in all discussions; today, General Hnatov joined us in the economic talks. The principles of the economic document are absolutely clear, and we are fully aligned with the American side on this – I want to thank them for today’s video meeting. An economic action plan will follow. Europe will also be involved in reconstruction, certainly. In the near future, we plan to move forward on the other two documents as well. Rustem Umerov will continue the discussions. For tomorrow, we are preparing a Coalition of the Willing meeting – over 30 countries working with Ukraine to ensure security on land, in the air, and at sea. Next week, we will coordinate with Europe in bilateral formats. Ukraine is working swiftly; every visit and every negotiation we conduct always yields practical results for our defense and for our resilience. Today, our combat aviation has been reinforced – thank you. Details are not yet public, but we continue to strengthen our forces in the sky. Today, there is also an additional sanctions step in Europe – more sanctions will target Russian tankers and the entire Russian oil transport infrastructure – and this is right. In December, Ukraine will present its own package of sanctions against the tanker fleet working for the war, and we will extend this pressure through joint formats with our partners. There will be new steps against Russian propagandists as well. Today, I also received a report from the Head of Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service – including on the enemy’s economic situation and Russia’s growing dependence on China. Throughout Russian history, no one has ever surrendered sovereignty so much to China or any other major power. And it is astonishing how much Putin is paying just to avoid ending this war. Yet the world still has sufficient strength to end this war – to force Russia into doing so. Peace is needed. I want to thank everyone who is helping. And one more thing. Today, I spoke with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. We had a substantive discussion. I will not allow any speculation against Ukraine. If our partners – including our key partner in Washington – are speaking so much and so concretely about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, we must provide legal Ukrainian responses to every question and every doubt. This is not easy, but we definitely do not need any pressure regarding this. I expect that the People’s Deputies of Ukraine will present their perspective. Security challenges depend on our partners, primarily the United States, and political and legal challenges must be addressed by Ukraine. And they will be. Glory to Ukraine! Georgia: The longest daily civic resistance in the contemporary world is marking Day 378. The regime banned protests even on pavements, however their de facto President still has to sign it. #GeorgiaProtests 📷 Tata Peradze [image or embed] — Marika Mikiashvili 🇬🇪🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@marikamikiashvili.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 2:58 PM Today, on December 10, GD adopted a law that effectively prohibits marching on sidewalks in protest without permission.

It was less than two months ago that they did the same for “closing the road.” Now it’s essentially for just standing. #TerrorinGeorgia [image or embed] — Marika Mikiashvili 🇬🇪🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@marikamikiashvili.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 7:30 AM Britain: “Putin regards 🇬🇧 as 🇷🇺’s most implacable adversary. Let us embrace that. Britain should lead this hybrid campaign for Europe. Our world-class intelligence services, special forces and cyber force can deliver strategic effects through precision operations. 1/3 www.independent.co.uk/voices/russi… [image or embed] — Marika Mikiashvili 🇬🇪🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@marikamikiashvili.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM From former UK National Security Advisor and Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill at The Independent: (emphasis mine) Yet again this week, President Trump set Europe’s strategic challenge. Despite reaffirming US commitment to Euro-Atlantic defence once allies pledged to invest more ourselves, his new national security strategy pivots to the Pacific while his Ukraine peace plan negotiates European security without European input. Europe might not be on our own, but we need the capability to be self-reliant. And fast. As national security adviser, I dealt with the Salisbury poisonings, about which Lord Hughes’s inquiry reported last week. It was a turning point. After years of inadequate responses to Syria, Crimea, MH17, Litvinenko and Russian subversion, we decimated Russian intelligence capability with the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history and imposed genuinely painful sanctions. Yet even that success was fundamentally defensive. We responded to an attack that had already been executed. We established consequences but not deterrence. The truth is, we are already at war: conventional war in Ukraine, hybrid war elsewhere. Putin certainly believes he is at war with us. As I told parliament recently, Russia could bring Britain to a standstill with a cyber attack on our food distribution system, coupled with an information operation to create panic buying and public disorder. No missiles or troops required. Sun Tzu wrote: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected”. Nato too should manoeuvre in this grey zone. We could target Russian vulnerabilities, including ageing energy infrastructure, dependence on Western systems, an isolated Kaliningrad enclave, and concentrated military-industrial facilities. We should deny insurance to Russia’s shadow fleet, impound vessels in Nato waters and pass extra-territorial legislation enabling Nato navies to respond to cable attacks in international waters. We should demonstrate our capability to mount cyber attacks against Russian energy and military infrastructure. And we should apply systematic pressure to its Kaliningrad enclave, which relies on land and sea access via Nato territory. Won’t this provoke Russian escalation? Putin invaded Ukraine, uses chemical weapons, shoots down civilian aircraft, sabotages infrastructure, assassinates dissidents and subverts democracy, all without facing severe consequences. Yet Nato is mesmerised by fear of retaliation, while Russia follows Lenin’s doctrine of continuous escalation until met with steel. The risk is not that we provoke attacks. They are attacking us already. The risk is that failing to impose a price invites further aggression. Some argue this requires unanimous European support we cannot secure. Wrong question. Several allies – Nordics, Baltics, Poland – who understand the threat are ready. France and Germany will follow once we demonstrate resolve. Coalitions of the willing have repeatedly moved the Nato consensus. Waiting for permission guarantees continued Russian aggression. Putin regards the UK as Russia’s most implacable adversary. Let us embrace that. Britain should lead this hybrid campaign for Europe. Our world-class intelligence services, special forces and cyber force can deliver strategic effects through precision operations. Our strategic culture is not paralysed by fear. We understand that credible deterrence is offensive, not just defensive, striking where Russia is vulnerable, forcing them to defend everywhere, imposing costs through means difficult to predict. This is a hybrid war of manoeuvre. Europe needs a nation willing to spearhead it. Britain should be that nation. This is all strategically sound. It would be easier if Britain could make up its mind over whether it is in or out of Europe. And if the current Labour government wasn’t busy self immolating by attempting to implement the centrist commentators and consultants recommendations the goal of which is to make Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias spontaneously orgasm. Denmark: The world is upside down 😐 [image or embed] — Kate from Kharkiv (@kateinkharkiv.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM From CNN: Denmark has labeled the United States as a potential security concern for the first time in an annual report released by one of its intelligence agencies, offering more evidence of the increasingly fraught transatlantic alliance between Europe and the US. The report, compiled by the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS), warns that the US “uses economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer rules out the use of military force, even against allies.” That assessment forms part of the service’s wider analysis that “great powers increasingly prioritize their own interests and use force to achieve their goals.” CNN has reached out to the US Embassy in Copenhagen and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Washington for comment. Apart from its warning relating to the US, the report largely focuses on strategic threats posed by Russia and China, as well as instability brought about by China’s rise and the resulting global shift in power. It points out that the “military threat from Russia to NATO will increase,” a concern magnified for the Danes since “there is uncertainty about the role of the United States as a guarantor of Europe’s security.” Denmark’s normally friendly relationship with its NATO ally grew strained earlier this year when US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of Greenland, an autonomous, resource-rich, strategically significant Arctic island that is legally part of the Danish kingdom. That relationship is once again under scrutiny as the differing strategic priorities of the US and Europehave been exposed in the recent Ukrainian peace talks and, most dramatically, in the national security strategy released Friday by the Trump administration, which adopted an unprecedented confrontational posture toward Europe And for Denmark, the threats posed by Russia and the US are intertwined. The report argues that “Russia will try to exploit the US desire for a quick end to the (Ukraine) war to sow division between the US and Europe.” The threat of Russian sabotage groups infiltrating Ukraine from Transnistria is growing. Sources in Ukraine’s military intelligence tell 24 Kanal that Moscow is rapidly stepping up activity in the region to stretch Ukrainian resources and create a new front.

YY_Sima Qian December 10, 2025 at 11:59 pm For the 1st time ever (I think), the DPRK did not merit a mention in the NSS. YY_Sima Qian December 11, 2025 at 12:02 am I don’t think Putin has surrendered any sovereignty to the PRC (on the parallel of Muscovy to the Golden Horde, for example), but he has certainly allowed the PRC to gain enormous leverage over Russia. HumboldtBlue December 11, 2025 at 12:21 am I’d like to clarify that I just realized I posted a link last night that I didn’t properly quote, and it may have led a commenter to think that was me. Pfft, my cat has more cogent comment on current affairs than I do. That is Paul Warburg. Many people say that Ukraine can’t possibly win its war against Russia, because Russia is a much larger opponent. But this doesn’t match even with Russia’s own recent history. In this video, I talk about the growing Ukrainian insurgency movement in the occupied Donbas region, and how it is making a meaningful difference on the battlefield. I map this to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, a war that they ultimately lost due to insurgency. I then talk about why this matters for any peace deals between Ukraine and Russia, showing why failing to understand these dynamics will almost certainly lead to a peace that doesn’t last. Here is his latest post from earlier today. Also, while we’re on the subject of the horrors of war, here is Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise, based on a manga by Kazuyoshi Takeda, joins films like “Grave of the Fireflies” and “In This Corner of the World” in using anime to portray the horrors of the war. Grave of the Fireflies, like Come and See, will break one down, and are at the top of the list of movies you may not wanna watch again. bad Jim December 11, 2025 at 12:38 am I found the piece by Mark Sedwill pretty thrilling. Any mention of threatening Kaliningrad gratifies my black heart. Jay December 11, 2025 at 1:27 am As always, thank you, Adam. Jay December 11, 2025 at 1:47 am Anton Gerashchenko @Gerashchenko_en 16h War historian Antony Beevor explained in an interview with The Telegraph why Russia commits such atrocities in Ukraine: He argues that Russia has historically developed a belief that conspicuous cruelty is a necessary weapon of war. According to the historian, while Europe went through the Enlightenment and attempted to “civilize” war by creating the Red Cross and similar attitudes. Russia, however, did not embrace this evolution. ◾️ Beevor links modern cruelty not only to army traditions, but also to deeply rooted violence within Russian society. Putin’s soldiers, he emphasizes, often become victims of abuse themselves. The historian recalls how, in the 1990s, while working in Russian archives, he learned that “there were up to 5,000 suicides a year” among conscripts in the Soviet Union, and Soviet generals found this funny. Now, Beevor notes, Russian conscripts are killing themselves because they are subjected not only to bullying but also to persecution and torture. The command often approves of this ‘tradition’ of treating recruits. ◾️ Beevor calls this phenomenon a “knock-on theory of oppression”: having experienced violence themselves, soldiers then take it out on the defenseless. This is what happened in Germany in 1945, and it was repeated in all wars in which Soviet and then Russian troops participated. When asked whether cruelty is considered legitimate in Russia, the historian replied that Russians “don’t give a damn about legitimacy, to be perfectly honest.” ◾️ The war will end someday, and hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers will return home. What will happen when people accustomed to violence, looting, and murder find themselves among the civilian population? “We’ve already been hearing anecdotal evidence of appalling crimes being committed,” Beevor said. He highlighted the Russian command’s inhumane treatment of its own troops: mobile crematoria at the front, the use of convicts in “punishment” units for demining and suicide attacks – all of which are a continuation of old practices. “They’ve certainly been using the idea of punishment battalions that Stalin actually copied from the Germans,” Beevor added. ◾️ The historian warned that if the Kremlin considers its campaign in Ukraine successful, the Baltic states could be the next target. He recalled the lessons of the past: after World War I, the British and French could not believe that anyone would want another war, and therefore underestimated Hitler. “We’ve seen a similar thing in the 2000s Nobody believed that anyone would want to have another ground war on the European landmass again. [Under Putin], the sheer brutality of the Russian way of war could well be reapplied on the European landmass,” Beevor concluded. 📹: Chechen poet Apti Bisultanov on the Russian army, March 2006 Dec 10, 2025 · Anton Gerashchenko @Gerashchenko_en 12h Those who believe or claim that “if Ukraine gives up part of its territory – or even the whole country – peace will come” either do not understand how the Russian state operates or are deliberately misleading others. It’s enough to look at what Russia does wherever it manages to entrench itself: each occupied territory is turned into a space where land, infrastructure and people are either destroyed or repurposed to serve Russia’s economy and war effort. And this is not a “new course” for the Kremlin. Historically, Russia has never stopped at what it seized: it incorporated, subdued, and exploited. In the early 20th century, during the civil war and “Sovietization” of Ukraine, the same pragmatic formula applied: control of territory = control of the population. Registration, coercion, mobilization, repression, “re-education.” The war was not only for land – it was to turn society into a resource. Russia’s wars in Chechnya demonstrated the very same logic: the defiant were killed, the rest became fully controlled. Today, in the occupied Ukrainian territories, we see the same steps: ▪️ First, “legalization” of control through passportization: a Russian passport equals survival. Access to healthcare, employment, property, social benefits, education, and even movement is tied to having Russian documents. This is not bureaucracy, it is a mechanism to force people to “fit into” the occupation order. A century ago, the Bolsheviks used registers, commissariats, certificates and supply control for the same purpose: if you wanted to survive, you had to be registered and kept under the system’s control. ▪️ Second, the repressive framework. Occupation brings with it filtration, detentions, torture, “cases” for disloyalty – and systematic hunting for those capable of organizing resistance: veterans, activists, journalists, civil servants, teachers. In 1918-1921, the Bolsheviks consolidated power in exactly the same way – not through persuasion, but through punitive infrastructure: first crush the elites and alternative institutions, then “rewire” society. ▪️ Third – the most terrifying: turning people into “human resources” for war. In the occupied territories, Russia is pulling Ukrainians into its draft system through registries, military commissariats, and forced “status changes”; expanding contract enlistment through blackmail and dependency; and using places of detention as channels of coercion. According to data from the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, presented by Dmytro Usov at Crimea Global, from February 2022 to July 2025 Russia forcibly mobilized 46,327 Ukrainian citizens from the occupied territories; it was also reported that former Ukrainian servicemen were being used, that units were formed (two battalions and two detachments), and that 62 contracts had been signed. The historical parallel is direct: in 1918, the Red Army quickly became a mass conscription machine, and the Ukrainian population was used as a mobilization reserve for the imperial center; even during the Winter War of 1939-1940, formations from Soviet Ukraine (notably the 44th and 70th divisions) were sent to the Finnish front, and Ukrainian sources estimate up to ~40,000 Ukrainians killed in that war. ▪️ Fourth, long-term planning – children and identity. Under Russian occupation, “patriotic” and military upbringing, cadet programs, preparation for service in Russian structures, and pressure on the Ukrainian language and curriculum are launched. Early Soviet rule operated in exactly the same way: to raise a “new person,” impose one history, one loyalty – and create a generation more easily mobilized and controlled. ▪️ And finally – economy and territory as a staging ground. Occupied lands are reconfigured to fit Russian supply chains and wartime needs, while the territory itself is repurposed for military logistics and basing. A hundred years ago, the imperial center viewed Ukraine the same way – as a critical resource base for grain, industry, transport hubs – and subordinated all of it to war. Today the principle is the same, only the tools are more modern. ‼️ This is why the occupation of Ukraine that Russia dreams of is not the “end of the war” for Russia. It is a resource that Putin wants to obtain for future wars: • human (draft and contracts); • territorial (a forward operating platform); • economic (restructured production and logistics); • ideological (re-educating children and normalizing violence). History shows a simple truth: when Russia gains control of a territory, it converts it into control over people – and into the capacity to wage further wars. nitter.poast.org/Gerashchenko_en There is more,………………….

Title: Divided Fed cuts rates, hints at a pause and just one cut next year as growth rebounds

New policymaker projections issued after the U.S. central bank's final two-day meeting of 2025 showed a median expectation for a single quarter-percentage-point cut next year, the same as in September. But it was accompanied by a wide range of estimates that starkly illustrated the depth of disagreement about where to take monetary policy in 2026 and beyond in an economy being reshaped by President Donald Trump's policies and an artificial intelligence investment boom. "In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data," the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a policy statement that was tweaked to add language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions - an outlook at odds with market expectations still leaning toward two rate cuts in 2026. Policymakers' refreshed estimates - hindered by incomplete data about the economy after a six-week government shutdown - also showed they expect inflation to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%, an outlook that should dispel worries about potential stagflation that have persisted this year. The wide disagreement on the appropriate policy for such an environment also showed how challenging it could be to build a consensus in a policymaking body about to experience a leadership change, with Trump expected to nominate a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell within the next few weeks. In a press conference after the meeting, Powell said: "I would note that having reduced our policy rate by 75 basis points since September and 175 basis points since last September, the fed funds rate is now within a broad range of estimates of its neutral value, and we are well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves." Powell, who repeatedly referenced being in a strong position to wait on the next move, added, though, that Fed officials have made no decision about what to do with rates at their next policy meeting in late January. Major U.S. stock indices closed higher, while the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies and Treasury yields dropped. "The 25-basis-point rate cut was widely expected and the economic projections remain optimistic. I would view this as a semi-dovish, cautious statement," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. "The markets are applauding this decision." Other analysts pointed to the wide range of policymaker views on the outlook for rates. "It's definitely a hawkish cut, not so much in the fact that we had two dissenters that wanted to stand pat, but if you look at the 'dot plot,' there were six of them that penciled in no rate cut at this meeting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. The dot plot graphic of Fed policymaker rate-path projections showed six "dots" at 3.9%, where the policy rate was before the rate cut on Wednesday. The decision to lower the benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 3.50%-3.75% range drew three dissents, with Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joining Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in arguing the policy rate should be left unchanged, and Fed Governor Stephen Miran again advocating a larger half-percentage-point reduction. How monetary policy evolves from here, heading into a U.S. midterm election year that could revolve around the performance of the economy and with Trump urging sharper rate reductions, will now hinge on data that is still lagging from the impact of the 43-day federal government shutdown in October and November. The projections are in a sense optimistic: Interest rates may remain higher than anticipated, but the economy is seen growing faster even as inflation falls and the jobless rate also eases lower. But the latest policy statement and projections were crafted without the benefit of recent job and inflation reports, and instead relied on "available indicators," which Fed officials have said include their own internal surveys, community contacts and private data. The most recent official data on unemployment and inflation is for September, and showed the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% from 4.3%, while the Fed's preferred measure of inflation also increased slightly to 2.8% from 2.7%. The Fed has a 2% inflation target, but the pace of price increases has risen steadily from 2.3% in April, a fact at least partly attributable to the pass-through of rising import taxes to consumers and a driving force behind the central bank's policy divide. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. "Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace," the Fed's policy statement said. "Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September," it said, dropping a reference to the jobless rate as "low." The updated projections showed a core of six policymakers preferring no rate cut this year, and seven anticipating no further cuts in 2026. The median projection is for one additional quarter-percentage-point cut in 2027 as well, as inflation continues to subside towards the central bank's 2% target. "Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while, although continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25-basis-point cut into the mix for January," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock and one of the five finalists Trump is considering as a successor to Powell.

Title: Congress Advances Historic Crackdown On American Cash Fueling China

A long-sought crackdown on U.S. funding of China’s military and strategic industries is on the verge of becoming law after House lawmakers successfully embedded sweeping outbound-investment restrictions into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House passed the massive $900 billion defense policy bill Wednesday, setting the stage for a Senate vote next week before the measure heads to President Donald Trump’s desk. Backers of the outbound investment curbs — including Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky — call it the “strongest framework in history” for safeguarding American capital and strengthening national security. “This legislation takes President Trump’s America First Investment Policy to the next level and puts Beijing on notice,” said Barr, who introduced the Foreign Investment Guardrails to Help Thwart (FIGHT) China Act included in the House version of the NDAA. “Congress is sending a clear message: no more American money for the [Chinese Communist Party] to build missiles aimed at our troops, the next spy balloon that will fly over our communities, or any other product that could harm Americans.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: US Nuclear Bomber Fleet Shares Fence With Trailer Park Linked To Chinese Intel-Tied Fraudster) WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 7: Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) speaks with Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on May 7, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images) If enacted, the provision would prohibit U.S. investments in sensitive Chinese technologies, require domestic firms to notify the Treasury Department of certain transactions in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and empower the Treasury secretary to sanction Chinese entities tied to the country’s military or intelligence services. Lawmakers attempted to attach similar language to defense funding bills in both 2023 and 2024 but were ultimately unsuccessful. Notably, the measure ran into resistance in 2023 from then-House Financial Services Committee chair and Republican North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, who said that more U.S. private investment in China would prevent Beijing from taking state control of them. The push now has broad bipartisan support and strong backing from China hawks who warn that billions in American capital have fueled PRC critical-technology firms, including those linked to the Chinese military, the surveillance state and the CCP’s genocide against Uyghur Muslims. In 2023 alone, major American financial institutions like BlackRock steered $6.5 billion into 63 Chinese companies blacklisted by the U.S. government for supporting the CCP military or human-rights abuse, according to the House Select Committee on the CCP. The restrictions would also extend to investments in other nations that are U.S. adversaries, including Iran and North Korea. “President Trump has made clear the past few decades of investments propping up Communist China’s aggression must come to an end,” said Speaker Mike Johnson, calling the inclusion of investment restrictions an “important step to protect our nation’s national security and economic competitiveness.” Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who sponsored the Senate version of the FIGHT China Act, also said he is pleased the effort is nearing the finish line. “This landmark legislation would prohibit and require notification of U.S. investments in certain technologies in countries of concern, ensuring American ingenuity, innovation, and investment do not end up in the hands of adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party to be weaponized against us,” said Cornyn. Republican Rep. Brian Mast of Florida likewise called the measure a “huge win” for national security, cutting off “American investors to feed the Beijing military machine.” The investment curbs also have Democratic backing, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who co-sponsored the Senate bill and called it an “important step toward ensuring the United States remains the world’s leader in advanced technology.” Among the other victories for China hawks in the NDAA is the BIOSECURE Act, which limits federal contracts with biotechnology firms linked to foreign adversaries such as the PRC. The provision was previously sidelined in 2024 after Democrat Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts — then chair of the House Rules Committee — intervened to protect jobs tied to one of the targeted Chinese companies in his district. Despite the NDAA’s new restrictions on China, the president announced Monday that the U.S. will allow Nvidia to ship its advanced H200 AI processors to approved customers in China in exchange for a 25% surcharge. Critics argue the move risks eroding America’s technological edge and undermining long-term national security, noting that China is unlikely to produce a domestic equivalent before at least late 2027. While the defense bill cleared the House, it drew objections from several Republicans who criticized the authorization of additional security assistance to Ukraine and other foreign countries, the omission of provisions to ban a central bank digital currency, and the inclusion of certain DEI-related provisions.

UKRAINE HAS SENT Washington an updated plan for ending Russia’s invasion, Ukrainian officials have said, as US President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first US plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia’s hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it “takes into account Ukraine’s vision – it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues”. “We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side,” the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to a US plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kyiv and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as “decaying” and “weak” on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new US national security strategy said the continent risked “civilisational erasure”. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words,” Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine’s European allies put on a show of support for Zelenskyy as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest US proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked “wasting time”. “I think we had some little disputes about people, and we’re going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump added. Advertisement “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”. Talks between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelenskyy, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader – who Trump has accused of not reading the plan – said yesterday the plan had been broken down into three documents – a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine’s post-war recovery. Earlier today, Zelenskyy said he had held an online meeting with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine’s recovery. “This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said on social media. “We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment,” he added. But US leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. “Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don’t,” Trump said on Wednesday. “But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you’re losing thousands of people a week. It’s ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous.” - © AFP 2025 To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Create an email alert based on the current article

Title: Ukraine says it struck Russian shadow fleet oil tanker in Black Sea | CNN
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/europe/ukraine-strikes-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-intl

Ukraine struck an oil tanker belonging to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea on Wednesday, according to an official in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). A Ukrainian security source told CNN that Sea Baby maritime drones were used in a joint operation by the SBU and the navy. It was the third attack against Russian tankers in two weeks. Russia has been using hundreds of tankers, flying different flags, to clandestinely ship its oil to customers in defiance of Western sanctions. The Dashan tanker, which was flying the flag of the Comoro Islands, suffered “critical damage,” with preliminary information indicating the ship was “disabled,” the source said. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Video obtained by CNN shows a Sea Baby drone diving under the tanker before a series of explosions in the vessels’s stern area. Thick plumes of smoke then engulf the tanker. It was not immediately clear what cargo the vessel was carrying or whether the strike caused an oil spill. The ship was traveling at top speed through Ukraine’s exclusive economic zone, with its transponder turned off, when it was hit, the SBU source said. The vessel had been moving toward Russia’s Novorossiysk port terminal, a key Russian oil hub, the source added. The port was hit last month, when Ukraine struck one of Moscow’s largest oil export facilities. The attack, acknowledged by officials from both countries, marked an escalation of Kyiv’s efforts to target a key source of Russian war revenue. “The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce oil dollar revenues to the Russian budget,” the source said. The Ukrainian military operation follows a similar strike on two Russian shadow fleet tankers in late November. The SBU said the strike dealt a “significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.” The latest Ukrainian assault followed US President Donald Trump claim Tuesday that Moscow has the “upper hand” in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and that Kyiv is “losing” the war. Multiple Ukrainian and European officials have disputed Trump’s claims, although Ukraine’s position is acknowledged to be challenging. There are no new US or European assessments to suggest there have been significant changes on the battlefield that indicate Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces will triumph anytime soon, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile, talks over a US-proposed peace deal between Ukraine and Russia are continuing but have not achieved a breakthrough. US and Ukrainian delegations met virtually Wednesday to discuss plans for the reconstruction and economic development of Ukraine after the war with Russia ends, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X. The US delegation included Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock, according to the Ukrainian leader. “We discussed key elements for recovery, various mechanisms and visions for reconstruction. There are many ideas that, with the right approach, could succeed in Ukraine,” Zelensky said. The Ukrainians also “updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war,” he said. Zelensky thanked Trump and his team “for their substantive work and support.” CNN’s Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Title: US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates again as labour market risks grow

A divided US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Thursday for a third consecutive time this year, but signalled that it could hold off further reductions in the coming months. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is “well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here”. The Fed’s statement on its decision also brought back language used in late-2024 to signal a pause in more rate cuts. Powell stressed that officials are in a good position to determine the “extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks”. Wednesday’s reduction by a quarter percentage point brings rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%, the lowest in around three years, a move aligned with market expectations. The Fed pencilled in one more rate cut next year, and flagged heightened risks to employment as it announced its latest decision. But a rift within the central bank deepened with three officials voting against the modest reduction. Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee joined Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid to support keeping rates unchanged. Fed governor Stephen Miran again backed a bigger, half-percentage-point cut. The Fed’s rate-setting committee has 12 voting members - including seven members of the board of governors, the New York Fed president and a rotation of reserve bank presidents - who take a majority vote in deciding on rates. Powell noted that some disagreement was expected, pointing to tensions between inflation risks and a weakening jobs market: “It’s a close call.” “Inflation is well above the Fed’s target, but the job market appears to be softening,” said Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Mike Fratantoni in a statement. “Thus, there is ammunition for both sides of the debate” within the Fed, he added. For now, Powell said, the Fed is “in the high end of the range of neutral” rates, with neutral being a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. The Fed has previously described interest rates as “modestly restrictive” - “neutral” could suggest less justification to lower levels quickly. “We expect the Fed will want to pause for a while to allow time to for this and prior cuts to feed through the economy,” said economist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics. Powell added that the US economy needs several years where wages are higher than inflation for “people to start feeling good about affordability.” On Thursday, Fed officials also lifted their 2026 growth forecast, while easing inflation expectations and keeping their unemployment rate projection unchanged. These forecasts could shift as the central bank grapples with a delay in federal economic data releases after a record-long government shutdown. This week’s gathering is the last before 2026, a year of key changes for the bank. A new chief will arrive after Powell’s term ends in May, while political pressure mounts. On Thursday, Trump said the Fed could have “at least doubled” its rate cut. The president also signaled in a Politico interview published on Wednesday that he would judge Powell’s successor on whether they immediately slash rates. Interviews for his choice are entering the final stages, and Trump’s chief economic adviser Kevin Hassett is among top contenders. Miran’s term expires in January, creating an opening among the Fed’s top leadership. Trump has sought to free up another seat by attempting to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook too. Cook has challenged her ousting and the case remains before the courts. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco noted that Hassett’s potential appointment and a “more hawkish rotation of voting members” focused more on taming inflation means a growing dispersion in views. “Policy deliberations are likely to become even more divided next year,” he said. - Agence France-Presse New Zealand stocks ended with a slight gain but investors were largely sidelined.

PHOTO: EPA Summary AI generated Published Dec 11, 2025, 03:42 AM Updated Dec 11, 2025, 03:24 PM WASHINGTON – A divided US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Dec 10 for a third consecutive time in 2025, flagging labour market concerns even as inflation remained elevated as President Donald Trump’s tariffs bite. But the Fed pencilled in just one more rate cut in 2026 as chairman Jerome Powell signalled a higher bar for future reductions. Mr Powell told a press briefing that officials are in a good position to determine the “extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks”. The Dec 10 cut by a quarter percentage point brings rates to a range between 3.5 per cent and 3.75 per cent, the lowest in around three years, a move aligned with market expectations. But a rift within the central bank deepened with three officials voting against the modest reduction. Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid instead sought to keep rates unchanged. Fed governor Stephen Miran backed a bigger, half-percentage-point cut. The Fed’s rate-setting committee consists of 12 voting members – including seven members of the board of governors, the New York Fed president and a rotation of reserve bank presidents – who take a majority vote in deciding the path of rates. Mr Powell noted that some disagreement was expected, pointing to tensions between inflation risks and a weakening jobs market. “It’s a close call,” he said. The most recent official data on unemployment and inflation is for September, and showed the US unemployment rate rising to 4.4 per cent from 4.3 per cent, while the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation also increased slightly to 2.8 per cent from 2.7 per cent. The Fed has a 2 per cent inflation target, but the pace of price increases has risen steadily from 2.3 per cent in April, a fact at least partly attributable to the pass-through of higher US tariffs to consumers and a driving force behind the central bank’s policy divide. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. For now, Mr Powell said the Fed is “in the range of neutral” rates, with neutral being a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. The Fed has previously described interest rates as “restrictive” – “neutral” could suggest less justification to lower levels quickly. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. Mr Powell added that the US economy needs several years where wages are higher than inflation for “people to start feeling good about affordability.” Fed policymakers’ refreshed estimates also showed they expect inflation to slow to around 2.4 per cent by the end of 2026 even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3 per cent and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4 per cent, an outlook that should dispel worries about potential stagflation that have persisted in 2025. These projections could shift as the central bank grapples with a delay in federal economic data releases after a record-long government shutdown. A contentious meeting that has multiple dissents is a “normal and healthy” sign, said Mr Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics. Still, “more cuts now imply fewer later”, he added in a note before the latest announcement. “The central bank will want time to gauge how past cuts are impacting the economy,” he said. This week’s gathering is the last before 2026, a year of key changes for the bank. A new chief will arrive after Mr Powell’s term ends in May, while political pressure mounts. Dr Miran’s term expires in January, creating an opening among the Fed’s top leadership, and Mr Trump has sought to free up another seat by attempting to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. Dr Cook has challenged her ousting and the case remains before the courts – she continues to carry out her role in the meantime. In a Politico interview published on Dec 9, Mr Trump signalled he would judge Mr Powell’s successor on whether they immediately cut rates. Interviews for his choice are entering the final stages, with Mr Trump’s chief economic adviser, Mr Kevin Hassett, among top contenders. Others include former Fed official Kevin Warsh, Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Mr Rick Rieder of BlackRock. “The challenge facing the Fed next year is the potential jobless expansion, when GDP (gross domestic product) increases but employment gains are modest, at best,” Mr Sweet said. “This leaves the economy vulnerable to shocks because the labour market is the main firewall against a recession,” he said.

Thursday, 11 Dec 2025 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attends a news conference, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine August 23, 2022.REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Dec 10 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiysaid on Wednesday Ukraine had agreed on key points of a reconstruction plan for his country rooted in principles of solid security in discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior U.S. officials. Zelenskiy, accompanied in the discussions by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, other officials and senior military officers, said the talks focused on an "economic document". Also taking part from the U.S. side were President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "The principles of the economic document are completely clear and we are fully aligned with the American side," he said. "An important common principle is that for reconstruction to be of high quality and economic growth after this war to be tangible, real security must be at the core. When there is security, everything else is there too." Zelenskiy said work was proceeding on the "fundamental document" of 20 points aimed at ending the war now approaching the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour. He said two other associated documents dealt with security guarantees and economic issues. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany held a call on Wednesday with Trump to discuss Washington's latest peace efforts to end the war in Ukraine, in what they said was "a critical moment" in the process. Members of the "Coalition of the Willing" group of nations backing Ukraine, led by European Union member states, are to meet on Thursday, the French presidency said.

The BitMine Immersion Technologies chairman—also the chief investment officer at Fundstrat—said the Ethereum treasury firm has been “putting its money where its mouth is” of late, adding heavily to its balance sheet at Ethereum’s current prices. “BitMine believes Ethereum has already bottomed,” said Lee during a video interview with Farokh Sarmad, president of Dastan, Decrypt’s parent company. “Compared to two weeks ago, the amount of Ethereum we’re buying is more than double.” The Ethereum treasury firm has massively added to its position of late, acquiring more than 138,452 ETH last week, or about $460 million worth of the prominent crypto asset. That marks BitMine’s largest purchase since it added more than 200,000 ETH in October—all part of its stated quest to acquire 5% of the circulating Ethereum supply. As of Wednesday, the firm holds around 3.864 million ETH, or about 3.2% of the circulating Ethereum supply, a haul that makes it the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury and the second-largest crypto treasury of all with $12.85 billion worth of ETH. In terms of all crypto treasuries, BitMine trails only Bitcoin behemoth Strategy, which holds more than $61 billion worth of BTC. BitMine also holds 193 Bitcoin valued around $18 million, and $1 billion in cash. While both assets have fallen from all-time highs, Ethereum is leading the recent rebound, jumping about 8% in the last seven days to change hands at $3,376. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is roughly even over the last week, recently trading at $92,248. The BMNR frontman said he thinks both assets could have big moves before year’s end. Previously Lee had predicted as high as $150,000 for BTC before the end of 2025, though he softened his stance in the final week of November as BTC continued to trade below $100,000, adding that it could “maybe” still reach the $150,000 mark. Regardless, Lee and BitMine are more excited about Ethereum’s future over the next 10-15 years, particularly as Wall Street has embraced the layer-1 network and its place in the future of finance. “The reason to be excited about Ethereum is Wall Street is choosing to use the blockchain for the future,” said Lee. “It started with stablecoins, and it was a big ‘aha’ moment for Wall Street… but that’s just tokenizing a dollar. Now Wall Street wants to tokenize everything, and they’re not going to build it on Bitcoin—they need a smart contract platform.” That mirrors the narrative being shared by Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein, executives from global investment firm BlackRock, who said last week that tokenization is “the next major evolution in market infrastructure.” Ethereum is at the forefront of that trend, home to $12.1 billion in tokenized real world assets or nearly 66% of the distributed asset share, according to data from RWA.xyz.

Title: Vanguard’s 50M+ clients will soon gain access to crypto ETFs: Why this is significant

Vanguard is opening crypto ETF access to millions of investors. The move reflects a broader 2025 trend of crypto finding its way into investor portfolios. Vanguard’s decision to open access to spot crypto ETFs marks a major shift from its earlier anti-crypto stance and gives more than 50 million clients a regulated path to gain exposure to digital assets. The firm will allow trading of approved third-party ETFs tied to BTC, ETH, XRP and SOL while avoiding memecoins or unregulated tokens and choosing not to launch its own crypto products. The move brings significant institutional legitimacy to crypto and shows that even traditionally conservative asset managers cannot overlook sustained demand for regulated exposure to digital assets. Vanguard’s embrace of crypto reflects a broader institutional trend. Major financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Bank of America have already integrated crypto products as part of diversified investment offerings. In a major boost for digital assets, Vanguard is set to grant its large client base access to spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The move gives more than 50 million investors a convenient on-ramp and adds institutional legitimacy to cryptocurrencies. Vanguard’s decision to support regulated crypto products signals how the asset class has matured. This shift could contribute to broader interest in crypto and may influence how some investors evaluate their portfolio options. As one of the most conservative firms in traditional finance expands access to digital assets, the broader market may view crypto as a more accepted and stable part of diversified investment strategies. This article discusses the crypto ETFs now available through Vanguard, why this change in Vanguard’s policy is significant, how it reflects a broader institutional trend and how the move could influence global crypto markets. Vanguard has altered its policy of staying away from crypto ETFs. The asset manager will now give its clients access to third-party crypto ETFs and mutual funds that invest in selected underlying cryptocurrencies. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL). The products are traded on regulated crypto exchanges, much like ETFs backed by gold. As of early December 2025, Vanguard will refrain from issuing its own crypto ETFs or mutual funds. The firm’s approach is consistent with its policy of providing but not creating gold ETFs. It will not offer products linked to memecoins or unregulated tokens, which it continues to regard as overly speculative for its platform. In a client advisory, Vanguard noted that the chosen ETFs have endured market volatility, operated as intended and preserved liquidity. Vanguard’s educational resources continue to describe cryptocurrencies as a highly volatile asset category and emphasize that investing carries risks. According to a Vanguard spokesperson, the company serves millions of investors with diverse needs and risk profiles and aims to provide a brokerage platform that gives clients the ability to invest in products they choose. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, quoted Vanguard on how the ETFs have performed as designed through multiple periods of volatility. This policy shift by Vanguard is likely to impact the core strategies and long-term returns for millions of investors. The change could also redefine the accessibility and structure of popular diversified portfolios. As of Oct. 31, 2025, Vanguard was offering 224 funds in the US, including variable annuity portfolios, and 228 funds in international markets. Offering crypto ETFs on such an extensive platform will have two key consequences: It broadens the number of investors who can gain exposure to cryptocurrency prices without leaving conventional brokerage services. It signals that regulated crypto offerings are becoming difficult for major financial firms to overlook. Vanguard’s action comes across as a cautious initial step rather than full adoption. The firm notes that availability through Vanguard may lead to more demand for BTC and other prominent assets. This does not imply that more than 50 million individuals will immediately purchase crypto ETFs. Access does not equal investment. It does, however, reduce barriers for interested investors who want regulated access to crypto ETFs. Did you know? Crypto ETFs allow investors to gain price exposure to digital assets without holding the coins directly. They track cryptocurrencies and offer a regulated way to enter crypto markets through familiar brokerage accounts instead of crypto wallets or exchanges. Until early 2025, Vanguard was a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. Former CEO Tim Buckley often argued that spot Bitcoin ETFs “do not belong… in a long-term portfolio” for retirement savers and described Bitcoin as “too volatile,” “not a store of value” and a “speculative asset.” In 2024, Buckley stated that Vanguard would not support crypto products until Bitcoin changes as an asset class. In light of this perspective, the current policy change under new management stands out. It reflects a positive response to ongoing client demand as Vanguard investors watched competitors such as BlackRock and Fidelity receive significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s physical Bitcoin ETF made history on March 1 by reaching $10 billion in assets under management. It set a new record as the fastest ETF to reach that milestone. Less than three weeks later, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF climbed even higher and held $15.9 billion in assets under management. These figures illustrate how crypto ETFs have operated during their early adoption phase. They provide daily liquidity and integrate into standard portfolio processes despite the volatility of the underlying assets. According to a Bloomberg report, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments said that crypto ETFs and mutual funds have operated exactly as intended. They continued to function smoothly even during periods of significant market volatility. Hunter Rogers, co-founder of global Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash, said, “Naturally, that could accelerate the further legitimization of crypto as part of diversified portfolios.” Did you know? Crypto ETFs can trade on major exchanges just like stock or gold ETFs. This means investors can buy or sell them during market hours and benefit from intraday liquidity. Vanguard’s shift aligns with a broader trend in late 2025: Bank of America has expanded crypto access for its wealth management clients, with internal analyses recommending modest 1%-4% allocations for suitable risk-aware investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn tens of billions of dollars in total inflows since early 2024 and rank among the most successful ETF debuts ever. Their performance confirms sustained demand from both individual and institutional investors. These developments show that some investors are beginning to treat cryptocurrencies as potential thematic allocations. Expanded access could also heighten price fluctuations during major economic events, as ETF investments will carry conventional market views into cryptocurrency trading. Did you know? Institutional adoption of crypto ETFs has surged because they fit into compliance-friendly frameworks. Pension funds, asset managers and advisory platforms can access cryptocurrencies without building compatible custody systems. Vanguard’s decision to offer access to crypto ETFs may influence how retail and institutional investors approach the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The move may also alter market dynamics and liquidity across major digital assets. Cryptocurrency markets may react as Vanguard clients explore the new ETF options. The move could draw additional attention from investors who choose to allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto ETFs. However, many Vanguard clients are conservative, retirement-oriented savers who may not welcome the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. For clients who are willing to invest in crypto ETFs, adding these assets to their portfolios may expand available choices. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Title: Storm Bram: Status Yellow wind warning to come into effect overnight for three counties, as 2,500 remain without power

Some 2,500 homes and businesses still without power Around 90 flights cancelled or delayed across all Irish airports yesterday, while all ferries were suspended during the storm Status Orange wind alerts lifted from all areas last night as clean-up operation got into gear Storm Bram causes disruption, damage and power cuts across the country Forecasters have issued a fresh wind warning for three counties as the Storm Bram recovery and clean-up continues. Crews are currently working to restore power to the remaining 2,500 homes and businesses left without connection. Almost 60,000 premises were left without power at the height of the storm and thousands of commuters were hit by cancelled flights, ferries and trains as well as road closures. The south Atlantic storm significantly strengthened as it approached the Irish coast early yesterday morning and struck with powerful wind gusts of almost 120kmh. Now, forecasters have issued a Status Yellow wind warning for Galway, Mayo and Kerry. The warning will be in place overnight from midnight tonight until 7am on Thursday morning. Forecasters are warning of “strong and gusty southerly winds mainly affecting coastal parts.” Ireland is now on high alert for flooding amid fears the heavy rainfall associated with Storm Bram – combined with torrential rainfall over the weekend – will cause rivers and streams to break their banks. Irish Rail has said that all routes are back operational today. “A full schedule of services will operate on all routes today,” an Irish Rail spokesperson said in a statement on X. Flight operations at Dublin Airport are also "largely back to normal" this morning after what was described as a "day of significant disruption" yesterday. More than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines yesterday, and 20 flights were diverted to other airports. Today will be busier than usual for the staff, with more passengers at terminals due to their rebooked flights departing today. Meanwhile, a number of flights were also cancelled this morning following the disruption yesterday. A spokesperson for Dublin Airport, Graeme McQueen, told the Irish Independent: "Flight operations at Dublin Airport are largely back to normal this morning following a day of significant disruption yesterday due to Storm Bram." "In total, more than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines on Tuesday, while 20 flights diverted to other airports, before returning later in the day once the challenging winds had eased." Mr McQueen continued: "The Dublin Airport team worked hard through the night to help airlines prepare for this morning's busy first wave of flights, which has departed as normal, with only a very small number of cancelled flights on the departures board." "Today will be busier than it normally would have been in the terminals with many passengers who were discommoded on Tuesday being re-accommodated on flights leaving today. "We thank passengers for their patience and understanding yesterday in what were challenging circumstances due to the adverse weather conditions. "As always, passengers seeking updates on the status of their flight today should contact their airline directly," he added. Fortunately, major flood damage was avoided at high tides yesterday despite the sea surge associated with Bram as flood defences nationwide proved effective. Cork city suffered the worst of the flooding with some city centre quays closed and a number of low-lying roads outside the city proving impassable though no major property damage was reported. Flooding hit Waterford’s Plunkett railway station where operations had to be suspended after the tracks became totally submerged. Coastal flooding was also reported in Tramore and Dungarvan in Waterford as well as Blackrock in Louth and Clontarf in Dublin. Crews work to clear a fallen tree from Killarney Road in Bray during Storm Bram. Photo: Owen Breslin Waterford City and County director of services Gabriel Hynes told RTÉ the storm had brought an “extremely hazardous day”. He said there were coastal surges and overtopping, but storm barriers had been put up in the centre of Waterford city, which had protected the area. However, areas such as Tramore and Dungarvan had experienced flooding and waves overtopping but no significant damage. ESB Networks said crews have been working since first light to restore power to all homes, farms and businesses affected by Storm Bram. As of 5.00pm today, approximately 2,500 customers remain without supply predominately in the Southeast region. "ESB Networks moved crews from other areas of the country today to assist colleagues in the Southeast region to reconnect customers as fast as they safely can,” a statement said. "Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes. “Customers without power can check for real-time updates on when their fault is expected to be repaired at www.powercheck.ie. “If you come across fallen wires or damaged electricity network, never, ever touch or approach these as they are LIVE and extremely dangerous. Please report any damage to electricity infrastructure by calling 1800 372 999. Customers should have their MPRN available to access recorded information specific to their location." Status Orange wind alerts were lifted from all areas last night as the clean-up operation got into gear. Wind gusts of almost 120kmh were reported in some coastal waters as a Status Red alert was in place for all marine areas, with the south and west feeling the worst of Bram’s fury. This was later downgraded to a Status Orange marine alert. Sea swells caused extensive damage to the carpark at Doolin Pier in Co Clare. Photo: Press 22 A total of 70 schools remained closed or shut early because of the storm, all in exposed coastal areas of Munster and Connacht. The Department of Education said the decision to close rested entirely with local school boards of management who made such decisions based on local advice and the safety of school transport operations.

Photo: Gerry Mooney Multiple public attractions were closed yesterday because of the safety threat posed by Storm Bram including the Cliffs of Moher in Clare. Many outdoor Christmas lights attractions will undergo safety checks before re-opening today. The Punchestown race meeting planned for yesterday will now be staged tomorrow. Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

Tether, the company behind the $186 billion USDT stablecoin, is moving further beyond its crypto roots with a privacy-focused health and wellness app. On Wednesday, the firm rolled out QVAC Health, built on its AI development platform and designed to bring control to users tracking their fitness, nutrition and biometric data across devices. The app lets users monitor their health data — like step counters, sleep trackers, workout apps — and keep them offline and encrypted on their personal devices without passing through commercial servers or being harvested for advertising, the firm said. "QVAC Health reflects the company’s commitment to privacy-preserving local intelligence," Tether CEO Paolo Arodino said. "You shouldn’t have to choose between using the best hardware on the market and maintaining your privacy. We are breaking down the walls between Big Tech ecosystems so you can own the full picture of your health." The move marks Tether’s latest push into decentralized technology infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI), expanding beyond finance and digital assets. Tether has built QVAC, a decentralized AI platform to deploy agents and applications that can fully run on devices, bypassing centralized cloud infrastructures. Earlier this week, Tether said it invested in an Italy-based company Generative Bionics as part of the startup's 70 million euros ($81.5 million) fundraising round. The firm develops intelligent humanoid robots with advanced artificial intelligence, with plans for industrial deployment as early as next year. Before that, Tether bought a majority stake in Blackrock Neurotech, a brain-computer interface company, for $200 million.

Title: Bitcoin Roars Back To $94K — Traders Rush In As FOMO Explodes: Data

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin climbed to a three-week high on Tuesday before slipping back, a move that has traders and analysts watching closely. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin price topped out at $94,600 late in the session — its highest level since November 25 — then eased to about $92,450 at the time of reporting. Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, said social chatter calling for “higher” and “above” exploded during the spike, but market action remained uneven. Reports have disclosed that the surge drew heavy retail attention and a flurry of social-media posts urging more buying. Some market watchers questioned how organic the rise was. A well-known long-term investor using the handle “NoLimit” told his 53,000 X followers that the $94,000 push looked engineered: big buys packed into a few minutes, thin order books, then little follow-through. 🤑 Bitcoin enjoyed a much needed rebound back to $94.6K today, reinvigorating traders, causing them to FOMO back in and expect higher prices. According to our social data scraping X, Reddit, Telegram, & other data, calls for “higher” & “above” exploded. 🟦 High bars indicate… pic.twitter.com/o3U3yWkwkk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2025 That pattern, he argued, is how larger traders can create short-term fear of missing out so they can sell into strength. Santiment also highlighted a behavioral twist: smaller traders appear to pile in after spikes, often leaving them on the wrong side of moves. Volatility followed the high, as prices pulled back by a couple thousand dollars within hours. Exchange order depth and timing of large blocks, analysts say, matter a lot when liquidity is shallow. The US central bank meeting this week is a key wildcard. Market pricing on CME Group futures showed an 88% chance of a 0.25% rate cut, which many traders think helped fuel the rally. Yet some analysts warned that any sign of hesitation about future cuts could dampen risk appetite. Beyond US policy, next week’s potential Bank of Japan rate action is being watched because a tighter stance there could lift yields and pull capital back to Japan, tightening global liquidity. That kind of flow can pressure risky assets across markets. Meanwhile, long-term holders pared back supply after a 36% correction from the all-time high, and some addresses now hold levels seen in March. Jessica Gonzales, an analyst cited in reports, said M2 money supply sits at about $22.3 trillion and stablecoin reserves remain elevated, suggesting there is capital around but not necessarily evenly distributed in markets. Institutional moves also feature: big firms such as BlackRock and Strategy have expanded crypto exposure, which could add a steadier buyer base — or simply shift where risk sits. Short-term traders should track order-book depth, large trade clusters, and how price reacts to any Fed wording about future cuts. The next 25 days were flagged as especially important by several observers because liquidity swings and regulatory updates could flip the narrative fast. If a true broad-based bid forms, prices could move quickly. If the Fed signals caution, the opposite could happen.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Trump’s final round of interviews with Fed chair candidates set to start this week — as markets bet on Kevin Hassett: reports

Time Published: 2025-12-10T15:51:13Z

President Trump is slated to start his final round of interviews this week for a new Federal Reserve chairman to replace Jerome Powell, with top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett viewed as the frontrunner, according to reports. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were set to conduct the first of the interviews on Wednesday, starting with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, two sources told CNBC. “We’re going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. Along with Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, the top candidates for Fed chair reportedly include Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, along with BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. Markets are heavily betting on Trump to pick Hassett as the president looks for someone to slash rates at a speedy pace. A CNBC survey in December showed 84% of respondents believe Trump will choose Hassett. Prediction markets like Polymarket also show Hassett in the lead – though most bettors are placing money on Trump not naming any candidate by the end of the year. Having held key White House roles in both Trump administrations, along with working for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm, Hassett is widely viewed as the contender with the closest relationship to the president. “Personnel decisions to be made by President Trump will be announced directly by President Trump himself,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Post in a statement. “Any discussion until then is pointless speculation.” The upcoming round of interviews comes after a handful of meetings with potential candidates were abruptly canceled last week. Earlier this month, Trump told reporters that he knows his top pick to replace Powell, so it’s unclear if this week’s interviews are just the last step in the process or if the president has changed his mind. Trump, who nominated Powell during his first term, has railed against the chairman for months for not slashing interest rates quickly enough. Powell’s term expires in May 2026. Investors have been concerned about Hassett taking the position over fears that he would simply follow Trump’s orders. But the candidate said this week that he would not make his interest-rate decisions based on political pressure. When asked this week if he would listen to orders from Trump on Truth Social to slash rates, Hassett said: “You just do the right thing.” “Suppose that inflation has gotten from, say, 2.5% to 4%. You can’t cut,” Hassett said during a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday. He said he would rely on his own “judgement, which I think the president trusts, and the firm commitment to not being partisan.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. “Powell is likely going to become a lame duck fairly quickly,” Christian Hoffmann, head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, said in a note Wednesday. “Hassett appears to be the preferred candidate … and an announcement should come early in the new year, potentially less than a month from now,” Hoffmann added. “That introduces the concept of a ‘shadow Fed,’ with a prospective chair offering opinions or taking potshots from the sidelines.” The Fed is largely expected to cut interest rates again during its meeting on Wednesday. It would be its third consecutive cut so far this year. But investors and economists expect Powell to urge caution ahead. The Fed’s forecast in September only called for a single interest-rate cut in 2026. And policymakers are grappling with a mixed bag of economic data, including stubbornly high inflation, over 1.1 million layoffs planned for this year and a hiring slump. Central bankers are also missing some key economic reports after the record-breaking autumn government shutdown placed a halt on data collection. Advertisement

Title: PNC Bank just launched direct Bitcoin trading, but one specific restriction effectively holds your digital assets hostage

PNC's agency model with Coinbase spotlights a secure path for Bitcoin adoption amid complex regulations. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. PNC Bank, a US banking giant with more than $569 billion in assets under management (AUM), has embedded spot Bitcoin trading into its private banking platform, marking a distinct pivot in the institutional adoption cycle. This makes it the first top-10 US lender to allow clients to buy, sell, and hold digital assets directly alongside their checking accounts. The integration, powered by a partnership with Coinbase, arrives nearly two years after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs fundamentally altered the market’s structure. Since early 2024, products from BlackRock and Fidelity have dominated flows by offering low-fee, liquid exposure wrapped in a familiar brokerage structure. PNC is offering an alternative route. They are wagering that mass-affluent and high-net-worth clients will value the operational cohesion of a single banking dashboard over the razor-thin efficiency of an ETF. William S. Demchak, PNC’s chairman and CEO, said the bank is positioning Bitcoin not as an outlier asset requiring a separate app, but as a component of a holistic financial life. He added: “As client interest in digital assets continues to grow, our responsibility is to offer secure and well-designed options that fit within the broader context of their financial lives.” The immediate question for market observers is where this new offering fits in the existing distribution map. Spot ETFs have successfully commoditized Bitcoin exposure, driving fees down to the 20-basis-point range. Historically, bank-integrated trading has operated under a different economic logic. While PNC has not disclosed its fee schedule, bank-facilitated access to volatile asset classes typically carries a premium—a cost borne by the client in exchange for convenience and integration. This becomes a live experiment in how far convenience can stretch pricing power. If PNC’s wealth clients adopt the service despite costs that may exceed ETF access, it would imply that the real barrier has never been fees, but the procedural drag of opening outside accounts or maintaining separate crypto wallets. However, the scale of this experiment should not be overstated relative to the ETF market. The spot ETFs are highly liquid instruments integrated into the daily workflows of thousands of Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) and institutional trading desks. A private bank offering, by definition, is a “walled garden.” It is an additive channel, likely serving a specific demographic of wealthy investors who prefer relationship-based management over self-directed trading, rather than a direct challenger to the ETF complex’s dominance. The strongest argument for the bank model lies in workflow integration. For high-net-worth individuals, financial fragmentation is a genuine risk. Holding assets across a constellation of fintech apps, legacy brokerages, and bank accounts creates “dashboard blindness,” making it difficult to assess total liquidity or rebalance risk effectively. By folding Bitcoin execution into the primary banking interface, PNC addresses this visibility gap. It allows wealth advisors to view the client’s digital asset exposure in real-time alongside real estate, cash, and fixed income. This could theoretically elevate the conversation from simple access (“How do I buy Bitcoin?”) to strategic allocation (“How does this position affect my overall portfolio volatility?”). The integration also leverages a “trust premium.” While trust in crypto-native intermediaries has fluctuated, the banking sector retains a perceived safety advantage for older and more conservative capital. Although PNC’s arrangement is strictly agency-based, keeping Bitcoin off the bank’s balance sheet, the institution’s imprimatur still carries weight. Clients are, in effect, leaning on PNC’s vendor-risk machinery to assess Coinbase, shifting the due diligence burden that often keeps family offices and endowments at a distance. Structurally, the deal highlights the pragmatic path US banks are carving through a complex regulatory landscape. Direct balance sheet exposure to Bitcoin remains expensive under current Basel III capital rules, which assign punitive risk weights to crypto assets. Consequently, PNC has adopted an agency model, effectively white-labeling Coinbase’s infrastructure while retaining the client relationship. The arrangement suggests that US regulators, specifically the OCC, are willing to tolerate banks acting as gateways to the asset class, provided strict separation exists between the bank’s deposits and the crypto assets. Meanwhile, this is not an endorsement of crypto by federal regulators, but rather an acknowledgment that consumer demand is persistent and perhaps safer when routed through regulated banking entities. For Coinbase, this reinforces a strategic pivot from a consumer-focused exchange to a B2B infrastructure utility for traditional finance. If this model proliferates, liquidity could increasingly concentrate among a few massive custodians serving a network of bank front-ends. While the launch is significant, the utility of bank-held Bitcoin remains constrained compared to the crypto-native ecosystem. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, observed that while the current functionality is limited to buy, hold, and sell, “eventually PNC clients will demand deposit and withdrawal.” Currently, the product’s “walled garden” nature means assets cannot be easily moved on-chain or transferred to self-custody without liquidation. Furthermore, while the narrative of “bank-grade” Bitcoin implies future utility, such as collateralized lending, no major US bank currently offers Bitcoin-backed lines of credit, and regulatory clarity on such products is nonexistent. For now, PNC has opened a new door for a specific type of capital—money that was never going to navigate a crypto exchange or perhaps even a self-directed brokerage account. As Bitwise analyst Juan Leon termed it: “[This is the] Mainstream era: crypto x tradfi integrations.” Whether that integration generates meaningful volume or remains a niche service for the ultra-wealthy will depend entirely on whether the bank’s convenience can justify the price of admission.

Today’s top news: Bitcoin has been sliding, sentiment has been deep in Fear mode, and Crypto Twitter has been panicking. But one major bank isn’t concerned. JPMorgan analysts published new guidance pushing back against the idea that the latest drawdown marks a return to crypto winter. In fact, the bank says this is just a “meaningful correction,” not the start of a new bear market. They pointed to several short-term drivers behind the recent sell-off: The bank stressed that none of these dynamics signal a structural breakdown in crypto demand. And importantly, they noted that institutional interest, real-world adoption, and tokenization efforts remain intact. “The sell-off this past month triggered worries throughout crypto media and markets that the crypto ecosystem may be entering the next crypto winter. While we don’t anticipate the end of the current bull cycle, we do acknowledge this November pullback as meaningful.” “Overall, we struggle to see these recent market pullbacks as emblematic of broader structural degradation within the crypto ecosystem, and thus we continue to be positive on the space.” - JPMorgan analysts “This time really is different. We think crypto winters are a thing of the past.” - Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets JPMorgan’s overall message is pretty simple: prices may have dropped, but the crypto bull thesis hasn’t changed. They remain laser-focused on the major forces playing out in the crypto sector - ETF inflows, tokenization initiatives, bank participation, stablecoin growth. All of those big-picture fundamental indicators are still moving forward (and one could argue that they’re accelerating). And more broadly, both JPMorgan and BlackRock are bullish stocks (especially AI) into 2026, with BlackRock going full risk-on mode. So their macro view is bullish as well. That means the only real crypto bear case remaining is four-year cycle seasonality. Unfortunately, this latest drawdown lined up nearly perfectly with a 4-year cycle view and thus bears are in control. Until they aren’t. If/when prices do grind back up to near ATHs, the bull case that JPMorgan (and many others) has laid out will be shining brighter than ever. And 4-year truthers will have a hard decision to make. And with the Fed meeting on deck today, that catalyst to ignite the run back to ATH could be here sooner than later.

Enjoy your Fed interest rate cut today—it may be the last one for a while. There is a 90% certainty that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will announce a 0.25% cut to the base rate this afternoon, bringing it down to the 3.5% level, according to speculators on the CME FedWatch Fed funds futures index. But after that, the FedWatch index is indicating no certainty for any further cuts in 2026.Here are what the levels of certainty for keeping the rate at 3.5% look like for 2026, per FedWatch: Only in June does a plurality—41.9%—emerge for a further cut, to 3.25%. Analysts are all over the place in their guesses about how many further rounds of cheaper money the Fed will deliver next year, and with good reason: President Trump is set to replace Powell with a new Fed chair in May. “We see the Fed cutting rates twice in 2026, with moves in March and in June,” ING’s James Knightley et al. argued earlier this month. Plus, “the potential for a more dovish FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] tilts the risks toward additional rate cuts later in the year. “But does this matter, given that we know the Federal Reserve’s structure is changing?” Knightley wrote. At Deutsche Bank, the forecast is “one further 25 bp cut in each of 2026 and 2027.” Pantheon Macroeconomics’ guess is for three cuts: “We expect 75 bp of easing in 2026, but fiscal policy and FOMC personnel changes cloud the outlook.” The presumed favorite candidate for Fed chair is Kevin Hassett, widely regarded as a “dove” who will follow Trump’s preference for lower rates regardless of rising inflation. But there are three others in the running: Fed governors Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller, and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder. It’s not certain if the new appointee will tip the FOMC into a more dovish position (favoring more cuts) or whether the Fed’s institutional commitment to apolitical economics will prevail, which would imply a slower schedule of cuts or perhaps—if inflation continues to rise—none at all. ING’s Knightley noted that by the end of 2026 it is possible that “five of the seven members of the Board of Governors are Trump appointees.” The Fed is about to become much more unpredictable, in other words. Stock markets are largely in a holding pattern today as investors wait for the rate decision. It will be Powell’s commentary—and whether he says or doesn’t say certain words—that move markets this afternoon. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning prior to the open after the index closed flat yesterday. Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

Title: Bitcoin treasury rout deepens as Jack Mallers’ new firm falls 20% in trading debut
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-treasury-rout-deepens-as-twenty-one-capital-falls-in-trading-debut/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T12:41:27Z
Full Content:
About us Copy link Shares in the highly anticipated Bitcoin treasury firm Twenty One Capital plummeted 20% on its listing debut on Tuesday. Jack Mallers, the plucky Bitcoin evangelist running the venture, vowed in April to best the sector’s biggest Bitcoin buyers, including Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Wall Street titan BlackRock. Tuesday’s double-digit crash on the New York Stock Exchange has since dampened the excitement. The problem? Once invincible, Bitcoin treasury firms such as Twenty One have faced increasing pressure in recent months as cryptocurrencies plummet in value. Since Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,080 in October, it has fallen by some 27%, dragged by macroeconomic factors and market anxiety over the US Federal Reserve’s lack of interest rate cuts. Now, companies that raised capital to buy Bitcoin over $100,000 — thinking the asset would never drop below six-figures — are sitting on massive unrealised losses while their equity premiums have simultaneously evaporated. Metaplanet, a Japanese hotel operator turned Bitcoin treasury firm, has swung from over $600 million in unrealised profits in early October to around $530 million in unrealised losses as of December 1, per Galaxy Research data. Other firms with substantial Bitcoin positions, such as Trump Media and Technology Group, GD Culture Group, and Empery Digital, are also staring down tens of millions of dollars in unrealised losses as their share prices plummet. Twenty One’s trading debut makes it the third-largest Bitcoin treasury firm behind Saylor’s Strategy and MARA Holdings, a Bitcoin mining firm. The firm owns around 43,500 Bitcoin worth just over $4 billion. Yet its shares trade at a $3.85 billion market capitalisation. Such discounts often signal market pessimism, underperformance, or a lack of investor confidence in the firm’s strategy or management. Still, Twenty One is well-connected in both the crypto industry and the broader financial sector. The firm was formed through a merger with Cantor Equity, a special purpose acquisition company backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, an investment banking and brokerage firm chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Tether, the firm behind USDT, the largest stablecoin with over $185 billion in circulation, owns more than 50% of the venture, while SoftBank Group, one of the world’s biggest investment holding companies, also owns a significant minority stake. Mallers, too, is well-known in the industry for his Bitcoin fervour. The 31-year-old has been tinkering with Bitcoin since at least 2016. Before taking on the role of CEO at Twenty One, he founded Zap, the parent company of Strike, an app which lets users send and receive payments over Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Yet his brash, unapologetic attitude has also divided opinions. “I don’t give a fuck that you’re rich or popular,” Mallers said in a 2021 spat with Elon Musk over Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings. “You clearly know nothing about Bitcoin or you’re more egotistic than we all thought.” Tim Craig is DL News’ Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Title: Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital explores tokenized private market access

Mubadala Capital teams up with Kaio to test tokenized access to private market strategies, signaling growing sovereign interest in onchain real-world assets. Update Dec. 11, 7:06 am UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from a Kaio spokesperson. Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Capital has partnered with institutional real-world asset (RWA) infrastructure provider Kaio to explore tokenized access to private market investment strategies, marking a push from sovereign-linked capital into blockchain rails. The companies said on Tuesday that the initiative will assess how Kaio’s digital framework can enable institutional and accredited investors to access Mubadala Capital’s private market products onchain. The move signals interest in using RWA tokenization as a technological upgrade and a distribution layer for alternative assets traditionally gated behind high minimums, multi-year lockups and geographic limits. While no product is being launched yet, the collaboration marks a step toward digitizing fund structures and potentially opening global access channels to one of the region’s largest asset managers. Mubadala Capital manages, advises and administers over $430 billion in assets across private equity, credit, real estate and alternative strategies through its asset managers and investment platforms. It’s a subsidiary of Mubalada Investment Company, one of the sovereign wealth funds of the government of Abu Dhabi. On Nov. 19, Bloomberg reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), another Mubadala subsidiary, held at least $500 million in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Fatima Al Noaimi and Max Franzetti, the co-heads of Mubadala Capital Solutions, said in the announcement that the goal is to leverage regulatory-aligned infrastructure to test how digital rails can broaden access to institutional-grade products. Kaio, which previously supported tokenized feeder structures for asset managers like BlackRock, Brevan Howard and Hamilton Lane, brought over $200 million in institutional assets onchain. The company said the collaboration with Mubadala reflects momentum toward tokenized investment vehicles across public and private markets. “This launch demonstrates how traditional institutional capital is now scaling onchain,” said Kaio CEO Shrey Rastogi. A Kaio spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they will be tokenizing Mubdala Capital’s private market investment strategies. They expect to start the project in the first quarter of 2026 and will communicate specifics next year. Related: Tether’s USDt awarded key regulatory status in Abu Dhabi By engaging with tokenization infrastructure, the company joins a growing group of institutional players exploring whether onchain mechanisms can simplify processes, reduce friction and eventually widen participation. Digital asset investment company CoinShares previously reported that RWAs saw strong growth in 2025, led by tokenized US Treasurys. The report said that onchain Treasurys increased from $3.9 billion to $8.6 billion this year. The company predicted that this trend will continue through 2026, as global demand for dollar yields is expected to continue growing. Apart from asset managers, infrastructure providers are also preparing to meet a surge in tokenized RWAs. On Wednesday, Polygon deployed a hard fork that aims to reinforce its infrastructure and improve performance. The move seemed like a prerequisite for high-frequency use cases, such as stablecoin and RWA tokenization.

Title: Private Equity’s Utility Spending Spree Threatens New Mexico
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/12/10/private-equitys-utility-spending-spree-threatens-new-mexico/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T10:15:00Z
Full Content:
New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by landmass. With its abundance of sunshine and wind, the Land of Enchantment is “a natural location for renewable energy production and clean energy jobs,” the New Mexico State Land Office explains on its website. This ample renewable generation capacity has positioned New Mexico well to supply clean energy to Western states. According to Mariel Nanasi, executive director and president of New Energy Economy (NEE), “New Mexico can not only meet all of its energy needs through renewables and storage but could also produce electricity for the highly consumptive and populous states of Arizona and California.” Using transmission interties and wholesale market arrangements, it often does just that. More from James Baratta But Nanasi and her organization have sounded the alarm on a bid by Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, to acquire TXNM Energy for $11.5 billion. Announced in May, the deal would give Blackstone control of TXNM subsidiaries Texas-New Mexico Power and the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), which serve 800,000 customers. Unlike a leveraged buyout, the acquisition would be fully funded with equity. For Nanasi, the proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. “Blackstone sees this purchase as a very important strategic foray into the West,” she told the Prospect. Before obtaining TXNM, Blackstone must secure regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, or PRC. Blackstone also finds itself at the center of an ongoing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding, the outcome of which will determine whether the world’s largest alternatives asset manager can acquire TXNM without undermining wholesale competition or transmission service, causing undue cross-subsidization, or adversely impacting consumers. NEE has intervened in the PRC proceeding. The proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. Blackstone is not the only private equity player carving up New Mexico’s utility infrastructure. Bernhard Capital Partners, a smaller private equity firm based in Louisiana, has been seeking regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of New Mexico Gas Company (NMGC), the state’s largest natural gas utility. Bernhard reached an agreement with Emera, the utility’s parent company, to acquire NMGC for approximately $1.3 billion last year. The firm also owns traditional energy assets in Louisiana and Mississippi, after acquiring CenterPoint Energy and Entergy’s natural gas distribution businesses earlier this year. For its part, Blackstone has a 5 percent stake in the embattled Ohio-based electric utility FirstEnergy, and 20 percent of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which is reportedly planning to expand its natural gas power plants to meet electricity demand from data centers. Acquiring TXNM would be a first for Blackstone, as the $1 trillion private markets manager has never owned a regulated utility outright. A spokesperson for Blackstone told the Prospect the firm is “the right partner to support PNM’s long-term growth” and that PNM would operate as a stand-alone business with its own leadership, with strictly regulated rates from the PRC. But the Center for Biological Diversity, an intervenor in the FERC case, recently argued that Blackstone’s application neglects the anti-competitive effects of acquiring TXNM on customers, as the company could leverage its ownership of the utility in its continued pursuit of data center investments. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) acknowledged as much in their December 4 letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman. “Private equity’s money-extracting playbook isn’t anything new, and the consequences that usually follow aren’t either,” the senators wrote. BLACKSTONE HAS OFFERED TO PAY a 23 percent acquisition premium, or about $2 billion more than TXNM’s book value at the time the agreement was announced. The firm has proposed a $105 million rate credit to be distributed over a four-year period, equating to $3.51 a month for the average residential ratepayer. But NEE argues the rate credits on the table “are highly likely to prove illusory,” in large part because of the rate shock customers could face if the deal goes through. Blackstone has also announced a $10 million Good Neighbor Fund to assist low-income ratepayers over a ten-year period. The firm has demonstrated its willingness to lay out $25 million in investments for innovative technologies related to grid modernization, as well as $35 million to support economic and workforce development. “As part of the regulatory process, which includes further engagement with parties to the case, there will be opportunities for further discussions around the different ways affordability can be addressed with the benefits proposed in the application,” a TXNM spokesperson told the Prospect. The PRC and most state-level utility commissions have made it clear that customers cannot be charged any acquisition-related transaction costs, but critics say Blackstone could try to recover those costs indirectly by requesting a higher return on equity (ROE) in future rate cases, or by increasing capital spending, both of which are part and parcel of the investor-owned utility financial model. Blackstone disputes this, stating that the PRC and FERC “determine returns on equity and have oversight over capital spending; Blackstone Infrastructure and PNM do not control the authorized return on equity and PNM cannot recover capital spend in customer rates without commission approval.” (Bernhard Capital, in its attempted takeover of NMGC, has explicitly stated that customers “will not, directly or indirectly,” bear the costs of the acquisition.) Apart from customer benefits, there’s also the question of whether Blackstone would allow the PRC to preserve its jurisdiction over TXNM. Nanasi asserts it would not. “Blackstone has more money than the state of New Mexico,” she said. “They’re paying $2 billion more than the company’s worth because their plan is to get that back and then make some more money on it, so that’s how confident they are that they’re going to sweep us clean.” Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. The thrust behind her concern is the potential for affiliate transaction risk. Blackstone could leverage its ownership of PNM to benefit its investments in data centers and other businesses throughout the state. The firm owns three companies that already do business in New Mexico, including data center developer QTS. Under the PRC’s six-part test, Blackstone must demonstrate that it will not use PNM to give preferential treatment to its portfolio companies or cross-subsidize non-utility businesses like data centers. As a regulated utility, PNM has a monopoly on the delivery of electricity in its service area, which is why the burden is on Blackstone to prove that the company will not force ordinary ratepayers to pay more for electricity as a result of its non-utility activities. NEE has suggested that “Blackstone’s opaque corporate structure and history of self-dealing through affiliate transactions undermine transparency and regulatory oversight.” Conversely, Blackstone argues that “any interactions between affiliates are subject to adherence to local and federal regulations that focus specifically on avoiding unfair advantages or disadvantages.” But private equity firms should be expected to use every tool in their arsenal to influence regulatory decisions. One example comes from the Bernhard-NMGC case, which is further along in the PRC process than the Blackstone bid. On October 20, Bernhard and NMGC filed a motion to exclude the direct testimony of NEE witness Jesse George. In addition to his work as an attorney focusing on utility regulation in Louisiana, he serves as New Orleans policy director at the Alliance for Affordable Energy. The PRC hearing examiners disqualified George as an expert witness, based on the apparent lack of evidence for his qualifications to “testify on New Mexico regulatory law or policy,” per the November 3 ruling. “Blackstone is offering a Trojan horse to ratepayers; it’s a deceptive gift.” George’s testimony focused on utilities Bernhard has owned, including National Water Infrastructure (NWI), one of the largest sewer utility companies in Louisiana. According to the Energy and Policy Institute, an inspection by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality “revealed a large amount of sludge build-up, with bloodworms observed throughout the sludge—indicative of stagnant water containing organic matter often associated with sanitary waste.” Bernhard denied any wrongdoing, though it paid a small settlement to the department. In his testimony, George urged the PRC to consider Bernhard’s track record at NWI in its application of the six-factor test. “I think this sort of reducing of his status is pretty unusual,” said Keriann Conroy, research associate at the Energy and Policy Institute. “The only detail that we get from the hearing examiners [is that George] is not qualified because they couldn’t find evidence that he has other significant regulatory experience, so that seems sort of like a denial of his experience in Louisiana in some ways.” At a November 25 hearing, numerous public commenters expressed opposition to Bernhard’s proposed acquisition of NMGC. Among them was Patricia Brown, a longtime Sante Fe County resident and member of the New Mexico Energy Policy Research Advisory. She argued the PRC’s constitutional duty to regulate the state’s public utilities “was effectively subordinated when the hearing examiners barred from the record the history of fines, violations, audits, investigations and settlements associated with Bernhard Capital Partners and its affiliates.” Brown said that information “is directly relevant to whether the firm can be trusted to operate New Mexico’s gas systems safely, prudently and honestly.” These types of maneuvers were also seen the last time TXNM tried to sell itself. In November 2021, the New Mexico PRC rejected the company’s proposed merger with Avangrid, an energy services company and subsidiary of the Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola. The ruling concluded nearly two years of regulatory proceedings that exposed the prospective buyers’ “record of poor service, high rates, safety violations, bad faith contracts and market manipulation,” according to NEE. The following year, PNM and Avangrid appealed the PRC’s decision to the New Mexico Supreme Court. NEE described the move as “an effort to circumvent the authority and oversight of the Commission in their failed attempt to establish a ‘beachhead’ for domination of the energy generation potential in New Mexico at the expense of New Mexico electricity customers.” The group also alleged that “Avangrid and Iberdrola engaged in back door ex-parte communications” to convince the PRC to remand the case. The prospective buyers also threatened legal action against NEE, the only intervenor in the proceeding to oppose the deal, before abandoning their acquisition bid in January 2024. While that had a favorable outcome from NEE’s standpoint, the persistence shows the disadvantage of public-interest organizations relative to private buyers. PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS in New Mexico are appointed by the governor to serve six-year terms. In 2020, voters approved a constitutional amendment that restructured the PRC to be governed by three appointees rather than five elected commissioners, who previously served four-year terms. New Mexico has since counted itself among states like Minnesota where the governor is responsible for appointing public utility commissioners. The Prospect previously chronicled BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ efforts to manufacture support for its ultimately successful acquisition of ALLETE, detailing how the Minnesota Department of Commerce consulted with local environmental groups that came out in support of the deal. A similar saga is playing out in New Mexico. As The Candle reported, Dominic Gabello, a former senior adviser to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) and independent consultant, arranged a meeting between his clients at Bernhard and Grisham to “talk about their vision for the company and how the acquisition is progressing.” Both Gabello and Grisham have been silent on the meeting, which reportedly occurred on the morning of October 11, 2024. The Candle also observed that Gabello has yet to register with the New Mexico secretary of state as a lobbyist for Bernhard. NEE has been leaning on its twofold outreach strategy to educate New Mexicans about the implications of taking New Mexico utility companies private. “We have a legal strategy, and we have a political strategy, and we at all times try to marry those,” Nanasi told the Prospect. “Our jobs are to be translators.” As part of its political strategy, NEE has taken to highlighting the inherent irony of the name Blackstone gave to the holding company it will use to acquire PNM: Troy ParentCo. “The mission of the Trojan horse, a ruse, was to destroy Troy from the inside,” Nanasi said. “Blackstone is offering a Trojan horse to ratepayers; it’s a deceptive gift, and one that will ultimately dominate and destroy us if we allow them to enter New Mexico.” Correction, December 11, 2025 9:46 am: This article has been updated to reflect the fact that NEE has only intervened in the PRC proceeding. If folks in the business of writing, editing, and curating quality reporting and analysis can only make the math work by putting their work behind a paywall, we’re in trouble. Journalism is so critical to democracy that a free press is literally safeguarded in the Constitution. But it doesn’t say, “a free press only for those who can afford it.” Information is becoming available more as a luxury good than the basis of a free society. We will never put the Prospect behind a paywall because we think information should be free. But we need you to be a part of this project.Help keep the Prospect free and available to everyone, not just the few. Can you chip in to support our December fundraising campaign? We need to raise $100,000 by the end of the year to power our journalism in 2026. David DayenExecutive Editor James Baratta is a writing fellow at The American Prospect.
