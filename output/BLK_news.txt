Bitcoin led the $716 million of inflows to crypto ETPs last week, while Chainlink saw record gains, accounting for more than 50% of its AUM. Cryptocurrency investment products maintained upward momentum last week, logging two consecutive weeks of gains following substantial outflows. Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted $716 million in inflows, adding to the previous week’s gains of $1 billion, European crypto asset manager CoinShares reported on Monday. “Daily data highlighted minor outflows on Thursday and Friday in what we believe was a response to macroeconomic data in the US alluding to ongoing inflationary pressures,” CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, said in the update. The new inflows pushed total assets under management (AUM) above $180 billion, marking an 8% rebound from November lows following $5.5 billion of outflows in four weeks. However, AUM remained well below its all-time high of $264 billion, Butterfill noted. Bitcoin (BTC) led crypto ETP gains last week, attracting $352 million in inflows, followed by XRP (XRP) funds with $244 million. Chainlink (LINK) stood out with a record inflow of $52.8 million, which represented 54% of its AUM. Ether (ETH) funds saw minor inflows of $39 million, while short Bitcoin ETPs posted around $19 million in outflows, potentially indicating a lessening of negative sentiment. Among issuers, ProShares led inflows with $210 million, while BlackRock — the largest issuer by AUM — experienced $105 million in outflows. Cathie Wood’s ARK and Grayscale Investments also saw outflows, recording $78 million and $7 million, respectively, last week. Geographically, almost all regions globally saw inflows, with the most notable being the US, Germany and Canada, with inflows of $483 million, $97 million and $80.7 million, respectively.

Title: NTA says council sought more money for Deer Park steps due to ‘challenges on site’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/12/08/nta-says-council-sought-more-money-for-deer-park-steps-as-it-faced-challenges-on-site/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
The National Transport Authority (NTA) has said a local authority in south Dublin approached it for additional funding for the controversial construction of a new entrance to a suburban park at Mount Merrion as it had encountered challenges on the site and design issues. The Irish Times reported last month that the works, which involved the provision of 14 steps and a ramp at Deer Park, had cost a total of €753,528.43 inclusive of VAT. Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil subsequently that the cost involved in the project was “excessive by any yardstick”. Sinn Féin contended that it represented another example of a waste of public money. The park at Mount Merrion is run by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council but funding for the project was provided by the NTA. The NTA did not directly answer questions about whether it had raised concerns with the local authority about the cost of the renovation of the entrance to the park. The NTA said that in 2023 Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council had applied for “active travel” funding to improve the access to Deer Park from North Avenue in Mount Merrion as the existing steps were unsuitable for those with mobility impairments, cyclists or those using buggies or push chairs. It said the project aimed to construct a ramp and replace the existing steps to improve accessibility for all to the park and between the park, the adjacent primary school and local church. The NTA said in addition, “this link formed part of a wider 6.2km ‘Sea to Mountains’ active travel route, which connects Blackrock to Kilmacud” in south Dublin. It said this provided safe and inclusive access for walking, wheeling and cycling to neighbourhood schools, shops and community facilities. “Following funding approval, a contractor was appointed and works began in October 2023. In 2024, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown requested additional funding due to challenges on site and design issues. The NTA requested detailed cost reports as the project progressed and conducted a site visit in August 2025. Additional funding was approved to allow the project to be completed, ensure the site was safe and that the link to and through the park was accessible to the community. The project was substantially completed in January 2025”, the transport authority said. The NTA said “as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council were the project managers and are responsible for ensuring the project was progressed in accordance with applicable legislation and standards, any detailed information on these costs should be directed to them”. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council told The Irish Times last month that the works at Deer Park represented “a significant engineering project that encountered many challenges during the construction including the discovery of previously unidentified electrical cables”. It said these had to be relocated. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said in the Dáil: “Access to public spaces for people with disabilities is very important, but for €750,000 I was expecting a breathtaking feat of engineering. There is nothing spectacular, however. In fact, it is very ordinary, literally just steps and a ramp. The only breathtaking thing about this is the cost,” she said. Ms McDonald said the money involved “would pay the salaries of 20 new special needs assistants or 20 new nurses for a year”. “Instead, the money is spent on a few steps and a ramp that surely could have been built for a fraction of that cost. It is scandalous.” Mr Martin said: “First of all, I do not believe €750,000 is right, proper or appropriate in terms of 14 steps, but it seems to me the scheme that was completed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was not just about 14 steps. Nonetheless, the cost is excessive by any yardstick.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: What bubble? Asset managers in risk-on mode stick with stocks
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/07/stock-market-outlook-risk-on-ai-bubble-asset-managers/
Time Published: 2025-12-07T23:55:22Z
Full Content:
There’s a time when investments run their course and the prudent move is to cash out. For global asset managers who’ve ridden double-digit gains in equities for three straight years, that time is not now. “Our expectation of solid growth and easier monetary and fiscal policies supports a risk-on tilt in our multi-asset portfolios. We remain overweight stocks and credit,” said Sylvia Sheng, global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are playing the powerful trends in place and are bullish through the end of next year,” said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS. “For now we are not contrarians.” “Start the year with sufficient exposure, even over-exposure to equities, predominantly in emerging market equities,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, EMEA chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “We don’t expect a recession in 2026 to unfold.” Those assessments came from Bloomberg News interviews with 39 investment managers across the US, Asia and Europe, including at BlackRock Inc., Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Franklin Templeton. More than three-quarters of the allocators were positioning portfolios for a risk-on environment through 2026. The thrust of the bet is that resilient global growth, further developments in artificial intelligence, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus will deliver outsize returns in all fashion of global equity markets. The call is not without risks, including simply its pervasiveness among the respondents, along with their overall high degree of assuredness. The view among the institutional investors also aligns with that of sell-side strategists around the globe. Should the bullishness play out as expected, it would deliver a stunning fourth straight year of bumper returns for the MSCI All-Country World Index. That would extend a run that’s added $42 trillion in market capitalization since the end of 2022 — the most value created for equity investors in history. That’s not to say the optimism is without merit. The artificial intelligence trade has added trillions in market value to dozens of firms plying the industry, but just three years after ChatGPT broke into the public consciousness, AI remains in the early phase of development. The buy-side managers largely rejected the idea that the technology has blown a bubble in equity markets. While many acknowledged some pockets of froth in unprofitable tech names, 85% of managers said valuations among the Magnificent Seven and other AI heavyweights are not overly inflated. Fundamentals back the trade, they said, which marks the beginning of a new industrial cycle. “You can’t call it a bubble when you’re seeing tech companies deliver a massive earnings beat. In fact, earnings from the sector have outstripped all other US stocks,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, global co-chief investment officer at Northern Trust Asset Management. As such, investors expect the US to remain the engine of the rally. “American exceptionalism is far from dead,” said Jose Rasco, chief investment officer at HSBC Americas. “As artificial intelligence continues to spread around the globe, the US will be a key participant.” Most investors echoed the sentiment expressed by Helen Jewell, international chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BlackRock, who suggested also searching outside the US for meaningful upside. “The US is where the high-return high-growth companies are, so we have to be realistic about that. But those are already reflected in valuations, and there are probably more interesting opportunities outside the US,” she said. Profits matter above all else for equity investors, and huge bumps in government spending from Europe to Asia have stoked estimates for strong gains in earnings. “We have begun to see a meaningful broadening of earnings momentum, both across market capitalizations and across regions, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea,” said Wellington Management equity strategist Andrew Heiskell. “Looking into 2026, we see clear potential for a revival of earnings growth in Europe and a wider range of emerging markets.” India is one of the most compelling opportunities for 2026, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions. “We see real potential for India to become the Korea-like re-rating story of 2026, a market that transitions from tactical allocation to strategic core exposure in global portfolios,” she said. Nelson Yu, head of equities at AllianceBernstein, said he sees improvements outside of the US that will mandate allocations. He noted governance reform in Japan, capital discipline in Europe and recovering profitability in some emerging markets. At the sector level, the investors are looking for AI proxies, notably among clean energy providers that can help meet the technology’s ravenous demand for power. Smaller stocks are also finding favor. “The earnings outlook has brightened for small-capitalization stocks, industrials and financials,” said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of Franklin Templeton Institute. “Small-cap stocks and industrials, which are typically more highly leveraged than the rest of the market, will see profitability rise as the Federal Reserve trims interest rates and debt servicing costs fall.” Over at Santander Asset Management, Francisco Simón sees earnings growth of more than 20% for US small caps after years of underperformance. Reflecting the optimism, the Russell 2000 Index of such equities recently hit a record high. Meanwhile, the combination of low valuations and strong fundamentals makes health care one of the most compelling contrarian opportunities in a bullish cycle, a preponderance of managers said. “Health-care related sectors can surprise to the upside in the US markets,” said Jim Caron, chief investment officer of cross-asset solutions at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “This is a mid-term election year and policy may at the margin support many companies. Valuations are still attractive and have a lot of catch up to do.” Virtually every allocator struck at least a note of caution about what lies ahead. The top worry among them was a rekindling of inflation in the US. If the Fed is forced by rising prices to abruptly pause or even end its easing cycle, the potential for turbulence is high. “A scenario — which is not our base case — whereby US inflation rebounds in 2026 would constitute a double whammy for multi-asset funds as it would penalize both stocks and bonds. In this sense it would be much worse than an economic slowdown,” said Amélie Derambure, senior multi-asset portfolio manager at Amundi SA. “The way investors are headed for 2026, they need to have the Fed on their side,” she added. Another worry is around President Donald Trump’s capriciousness, particularly when it comes to trade. Any flareup in his trade spats that fuels inflation through heightened tariffs would weigh on risk assets. Oil and gas producers remain unloved by the group, though that could change if a major geopolitical event upends supply lines. While such an outcome would bolster those sectors, the overall impact would likely be negative for risk assets, they said. “Any geopolitical situation that can affect the price of oil is what will have the largest impact on the financial markets. Clearly both the Middle East and the Ukraine/Russia situations can impact oil prices,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Multiple respondents flagged European autos as a “no-go” area for 2026, citing intense competitive pressure from Chinese carmakers, margin compression and structural challenges in the transition to electric vehicles. “Personally I don’t believe for a minute that there will be a rebound in the sector,” said Isabelle de Gavoty at Allianz GI. Outside of those worries, most asset managers simply believe that there’s little reason to fret about the upward momentum being interrupted — outside, of course, from the contrarian signal such near-uniform bullishness sends. “Everyone seems to be risk-on at the moment, and that worries me a bit in the sense that the concentration of positions creates less tolerance for adverse surprises,” said Amundi’s Derambure.

Title: The Ways the AI Bubble Might Burst

[Editor's Note: this piece previously said "Blackstone" instead of "Blackrock," which has now been fixed.] I've been struggling to think about what to write this week, if only because I've written so much recently and because, if I'm honest, things aren't really making a lot of sense. NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs in the last four quarters — as I went into in my last premium piece — working out to somewhere between 10GW and 12GW of power (based on the power draw of B100 and B200 GPUs and GB200 and GB300 racks), which...does not make sense based on the amount of actual data center capacity brought online. Similarly, Anthropic claims to be approaching $10 billion in annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a month — which would make it competitive with OpenAI's projected $13 billion in revenue, though I should add that based on my reporting extrapolating OpenAI's revenues from Microsoft's revenue share, I estimate the company will miss that projection by several billion dollars, especially now that Google's Gemini 3 launch has put OpenAI on a "Code Red," shortly after an internal memo revealed that Gemini 3 could “create some temporary economic headwinds for [OpenAI]." Which leads me to another question: why? Gemini 3 is "better," in the same way that every single new AI model is some indeterminate level of "better." Nano Banana Pro is, to Simon Willison, "the best available image generation model." But I can't find a clear, definitive answer as to why A) this is "so much better," B) why everybody is freaking out about Gemini 3, and C) why this would have created "headwinds" for OpenAI, headwinds so severe that it has had to rush out a model called Garlic "as soon as possible" according to The Information: Right, sure, cool, another model. Again, why is Gemini 3 so much better and making OpenAI worried about "economic headwinds"? Could this simply be a convenient excuse to cover over, as Alex Heath reported a few weeks ago, ChatGPT's slowing download and usage growth? Experts I've talked to arrived at two conclusions: I don't know about garlic or shallotpeat or whatever, but one has to wonder at some point what it is that OpenAI is doing all day: So, OpenAI's big plan is to improve ChatGPT, make the image generation better, make people like the models better, improve rankings, make it faster, and make it answer more stuff. I think it's fair to ask: what the fuck has OpenAI been doing this whole time if it isn't "make the model better" and "make people like ChatGPT more"? I guess the company shoved Sora 2 out the door — which is already off the top 30 free Android apps in the US and at 17 on the US free iPhone apps rankings as of writing this sentence after everybody freaked out about it hitting number one. All that attention, and for what? Indeed, signs seem to be pointing towards reduced demand for these services. As The Information reported a few days ago... Microsoft, of course, disputed this, and said... Well, I don't think Microsoft has any problems selling compute to OpenAI — which paid it $8.67 billion just for inference between January and September — as I doubt there is any "sales team" having to sell compute to OpenAI. But I also want to be clear that Microsoft added a word: "aggregate." The Information never used that word, and indeed nobody seems to have bothered to ask what "aggregate" means. I do, however, know that Microsoft has had trouble selling stuff. As I reported a few months ago, in August 2025 Redmond only had 8 million active paying licenses for Microsoft 365 Copilot out of the more-than-440 million people paying for Microsoft 365. In fact, here's a rundown of how well AI is going for Microsoft: Yet things are getting weird. Remember that OpenAI-NVIDIA deal? The supposedly "sealed" one where NVIDIA would invest $100 billion in OpenAI, with each tranche of $10 billion gated behind a gigawatt of compute? The one that never really seemed to have any fundament to it, but people reported as closed anyway? Well, per NVIDIA's most-recent 10-Q (emphasis mine): A letter of intent "with an opportunity" means jack diddly squat. My evidence? NVIDIA's follow-up mention of its investment in Anthropic: This deal, as ever, was reported as effectively done, with NVIDIA investing $10 billion and Microsoft $5 billion, saying the word "will" as if the money had been wired, despite the "closing conditions" and the words "up to" suggesting NVIDIA hasn't really agreed how much it will really invest. A few weeks later, the Financial Times would report that Anthropic is trying to go public as early as 2026 and that Microsoft and NVIDIA's money would "form part of a funding round expected to value the group between $300bn and $350bn." For some reason, Anthropic is hailed as some sort of "efficient" competitor to OpenAI, at least based on what both The Information and Wall Street Journal have said, yet it appears to be raising and burning just as much as OpenAI. Why did a company that's allegedly “reducing costs” have to raise $13 billion in September 2025 after raising $3.5 billion in March 2025, and after raising $4 billion in November 2024? Am I really meant to read stories about Anthropic hitting break even in 2028 with a straight face? Especially as other stories say Anthropic will be cash flow positive “as soon as 2027.” And if this company is so efficient and so good with money, why does it need another $15 billion, likely only a few months after it raised $13 billion? Though I doubt the $15 billion round closes this year, if it does, it would mean that Anthropic would have raised $31.5 billion in 2025 — which is, assuming the remaining $22.5 billion comes from SoftBank, not far from the $40.8 billion OpenAI would have raised this year. In the event that SoftBank doesn't fund that money in 2025, Anthropic will have raised a little under $2 billion less ($16.5 billion) than OpenAI ($18.3 billion, consisting of $10 billion in June split between $7.5 billion from SoftBank and $2.5 billion from other investors, and an $8.3 billion round in August) this year. I think it's likely that Anthropic is just as disastrous a business as OpenAI, and I'm genuinely surprised that nobody has done the simple maths here, though at this point I think we're in the era of "not thinking too hard because when you do so everything feels crazy.” Which is why I'm about to think harder than ever! I feel like I'm asked multiple times a day both how and when the bubble will burst, and the truth is that it could be weeks or months or another year, because so little of this is based on actual, real stuff. While our markets are supported by NVIDIA's eternal growth engine, said growth engine isn't supported by revenues or real growth or really much of anything beyond vibes. As a result, it's hard to say exactly what the catalyst might be, or indeed what the bubble bursting might look like. Today, I'm going to sit down and give you the scenarios — the systemic shocks — that would potentially start the unravelling of this era, as well as explain what a bubble bursting might actually look like, both for private and public companies. This is the spiritual successor to August's AI Bubble 2027, except I'm going to have a little more fun and write out a few scenarios that range from likely to possible, and try and give you an enjoyable romp through the potential apocalypses waiting for us in 2026.

When people started experimenting with digital representations of real-world assets years ago, they eventually came to realize that the technology has little bearing on the ability to sell investments quickly, with minimal loss in value, he told Decrypt in an interview. “Providing liquidity to the asset class is as important as providing accessibility,” he said. “And there was a perception that tokenization was going to make those illiquid assets liquid, and that didn’t happen, because an illiquid asset is illiquid whether you tokenize it or not.” Whether it’s an ownership stake in an apartment building or a tokenized Pokémon card, Domingo said that a digital asset will inherit the illiquidity of its physical counterpart. That means assets could remain difficult to sell immediately without incurring significant losses. Domingo said the dynamic could eventually shift as the technology around tokenization develops, but in the meantime, people are focusing primarily on assets where existing liquidity can be amplified, namely cash and U.S. Treasuries. “We’ve gone in the opposite direction [of illiquid markets], where arguably the most successful tokenized asset is actually the dollar,” he said, pointing to the rise of stablecoins. Stablecoins, which are often backed by a combination of cash and government debt, are a $300 billion corner of the crypto market, according to RWA.xyz. Meanwhile, tokenized U.S. Treasuries dwarf tokenized stocks, at around $9 billion and $681 million, respectively. At present, Securitize is among several players taking tokenization to Wall Street, after helping issue BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (or BUIDL). The money market fund, which exists across several blockchains, has become a $2 billion product since its debut last March. In an article published in The Economist on Monday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein highlighted tokenization’s potential to “greatly expand the world of investable assets.” They described the technology’s adoption as notable in emerging markets. Asset classes like real estate are dominated by large institutions today, but the financial giant’s most senior executives posited that “smaller, more accessible units” could broaden access.

On November 10th, Tiffany Hsiao rejoined Matthews Asia after leaving the firm in August 2020 to join Artisan Partners to launch a China-focused private fund. Prior to her departure, Tiffany managed the firm’s China Small Companies, former Asia Small Companies (now Emerging Markets Small Companies), and Asia Innovators strategies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the way for Dimensional Fund Advisors to launch an exchange-traded fund share class on 13 of its existing mutual funds (see the November Commentary for the 13 funds) on November 17th. On or about January 28, 2026, CrossingBridge Pre-Merger SPAC ETF will change its name and its investment objective. The new name will be CrossingBridge Ultra-Short Duration ETF with a new investment objective to offer a higher yield than cash instruments while maintaining a low duration. The current ETF advisers allow that “the investor base interested in a very narrow pre-merger SPAC arbitrage strategy has diminished and the cost to acquire new potential clients is high.” First impressions aside, the Pre-Merger SPAC ETF is a low volatility strategy (maximum lifetime drawdown of 0.4%, annualized returns of 5.3%), which is consistent with CrossingBridge’s corporate ethos: “Return of capital is more important than return on capital. CrossingBridge seeks high current income and capital appreciation consistent with the preservation of capital.” Five of their six older funds have earned MFO’s Great Owl designation for having consistently top quintile risk-adjusted returns over all trailing measurement periods; the seventh fund, Nordic High Income, is fascinating but too young to qualify. Brown Advisory International Value Select ETF is in registration. Expenses have not been stated. Brown Advisory LLC serves as the investment adviser. FPA Queens Road Value ETF is in registration with the intent of reorganizing FPA Queens Road Value Fund into an ETF. Expenses have not been stated. Steve Scruggs, CFA, will remain the portfolio manager and has served as the portfolio manager of the predecessor fund. T Rowe Price has announced four new active fixed income exchange-traded funds: T. Rowe Price Short Municipal Income ETF (TMNS), T. Rowe Price Long Municipal Income ETF (TMNL), T. Rowe Price High Income Municipal ETF (THYM, Snowball begins humming about parsley, sage, rosemary, and …), and the T. Rowe Price Multi-Sector Income ETF (TMSF). Vanguard has launched three new actively managed ETFs: Vanguard Wellington U.S. Growth Active ETF (VUSG), Vanguard Wellington Dividend Growth Active ETF (VDIG), and Vanguard Wellington U.S. Value Active ETF (VUSV). VUSV’s strategy and management are similar to the Wellington Management portion of the Windsor Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.30%. VUSG’s strategy and management are similar to the Wellington Management portion of the Vanguard Global Equity Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.35%. VDIG is managed by the same team that is responsible for the Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.40%. Clearbridge Small Cap Growth fund is reopening to new investors on December 1st. The fund has been soft-closed since October 2013. Vanguard has trimmed its fees on its Primecap Funds: Additionally, Vanguard has eliminated its longstanding fee agreement with Primecap. Primecap will be paid a base fee plus (when it exceeds its benchmark) or minus (when it underperforms its benchmark). Previously, PRIMECAP was paid a simple, asset-based fee: a set percentage of each fund’s assets, billed quarterly. Bumpkus. DoubleLine Floating Rate Fund and DoubleLine Select Income Fund will, pending shareholder approval, be subject to a “Plan of Reorganization and Termination” through which they’ll become American Beacon funds on February 6, 2026. In each case, the change will involve stapling the words “American Beacon” to the front of the current name. If shareholders approve, the $23 million Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund is expected to reorganize into the $1.5 billion Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on or about May 8, 2026. If they don’t approve, their fund will be liquidated and the orphans cast out into the street. Laffer | Tengler Equity Income ETF will be reorganized into the Wedbush LAFFER|TENGLER New Era Value ETF. abrdn Bloomberg Industrial Metals Strategy K-1 Free ETF will liquidate on or about December 5, 2025. Fascinating factsheet: the fund has $23,214,433.06 in assets – presumably for about a 12-second window, has been in operation since 9/23/2021, and seems to have returned 0.43% since inception. The Acclivity Mid Cap Multi-Style Fund has closed and will discontinue its operations effective December 22, 2025. AB Sustainable US Thematic Portfolio will be variously terminated, liquidated, and dissolved on or about January 16, 2026. The two-year-old, $31 million American Beacon AHL Multi-Alternatives Fund has closed and will liquidate and terminate on or about December 30, 2025. BlackRock U.S. Insights Long/Short Equity Fund will close to new and subsequent investments on December 31, 2025, in anticipation of a January 30, 2026, liquidation. City National Rochdale U.S. Core Equity Fund will be liquidated on December 22, 2025. Decent fund with nearly $200 million in assets, but it appears that it lost a single large shareholder recently, with assets dropping by $199.46 million (per Morningstar) all at once. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF (BTFX) will be dissolved on December 16, 2025. Apparently, the advisor wasn’t able to find enough adrenaline junkies who wanted to take a ride in a vehicle twice as volatile as Bitcoin itself. How volatile? Ummm … on 10/6/2025, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC) hit $55.96/share. Six weeks later, it visited $36.42, a 35% drawdown. Year to date, BTC has lost 4% and BTFX has booked a 37% loss. Conestoga Mid Cap Fund will be liquidated on or about January 31, 2026. Cromwell Balanced Fund (formerly Cromwell Sustainable Balanced Fund) terminated the public offering of its shares and discontinued its operations on November 17, 2025. The microscopic DailyDelta Q100 Upside Option Strategy ETF, which pursues short-term upside bets on the NASDAQ 100, and its evil twin DailyDelta Q100 Downside Option Strategy ETF, both disappear on or about December 8, 2025, after just eight months of operation despite high nominal returns for QUP and correspondingly large losses for QDWN. Following the resignation of Raymond James as the fund’s subadviser, the FT Raymond James Multicap Growth Equity ETF will be liquidated on January 16, 2026. Goose Hollow Multi-Strategy Income ETF was liquidated on November 28, 2025. Lazard Global Equity Select Portfolio disappears on or about December 30, 2025. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be reorganized into the Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. The $16 million Rice Hall James Micro Cap Portfolio will liquidate on or about December 29, 2025. State Street Nuveen Municipal Bond ESG ETF, State Street SPDR S&P SmallCap 600 ESG ETF, State Street SPDR MSCI USA Climate Paris Aligned ETF, and State Street SPDR MarketAxess Investment Grade 400 Corporate Bond ETF are slated to undergo a singularly slow unwinding, with the funds closing on May 12, 2026, and liquidating on May 18th. Texas Capital Texas Small Cap Equity Index ETF, which promised you the opportunity to “harness the potential of small companies benefiting from the business-friendly Texas economy,” will be liquidated on or about December 15, 2025. Based on a simple comparison with Mairs & Power Small Cap, it appears that the “economic, regulatory, taxation, workforce, and other benefits” of operating in Texas might be just a little less compelling than those of operating in Minnesota. The $14 million Touchstone Climate Transition ETF (HEAT) will be liquidated on December 23, 2025, a decision attributed to the fund’s limited growth potential. The #1 and #2 holdings are NVIDIA and Facebook / Alphabet, dubious champions of the climate transition. Sanford C. Bernstein Emerging Markets Portfolio will be reorganized into an ETF through a merger with the AB Emerging Markets Opportunities ETF. While Bernstein is the investment adviser for both the fund and the ETF, the ETF is managed by a different portfolio team, one that employs an integrated approach that combines both fundamental and quantitative research to identify attractive investment opportunities to manage risk. The acquisition “is expected to be consummated on or about January 23, 2026.” (That sounds creepily like the description of some feudal lord’s wedding night, by the way.” Sterling Capital Short Duration Bond and Sterling Capital Ultra Short Bond Funds will be reorganized into the Sterling Capital Short Duration Bond ETF and Sterling Capital Ultra Short Bond ETF, respectively. The reorganizations are expected to occur on or about March 30, 2026. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: AIL wrap: UCD defy expectations with rip-roaring win over Lansdowne

Just when it looks as if the wheat was being sorted out from the chaff and one thinks Division 1A the form lines are possibly becoming set in Division 1A, along comes a weekend threat shreds such notions. The tone of round 8 had been set on Friday night when UCD defied form and expectations with a rip-roaring 43-38 win over Lansdowne on the Aviva Stadium back pitch, and that surprising tone rippled into Lakelands Park on Saturday when Young Munster stormed into a 29-0 lead against Terenure College before withstanding a late comeback for an overdue second win of the season. UCD had lost a week previously by 36-12 in Old Belvedere and after their summer exodus again fielded a team with no player older than 23. But they roared into a 28-17 interval lead after Max Doyle opened the scoring, Daniel Hurley struck twice, and Thomas Quinn added a crucial first-half stoppage-time try for the students before they capitalised on another hanging restart by Paddy Clancy for Evan Moynihan to score at the start of the second half. Even so, Lansdowne stayed in contention through tries by Bobby Sheehan, Jack Matthews, Greg McGrath and Harry Van Eaden before James Kenny’s score put them 38-36 ahead inside the last ten minutes. Whereupon, UCD’s Under-20 hooker Matthew Furlong, on debut, gathered an overthrow and followed up his own long punt with a tap tackle in the lead up to centre Ben Brownlee scoring under the posts. “I’m very proud of the fight shown by the boys after a week when we showed a great reaction to what had been a poor performance,” said head coach Emmet MacMahon. “It was a wild game but we managed to score different types of tries, which is always very pleasing.” In many respects, Young Munster were due a significant win after so many near misses. Terenure won the toss and elected to play into the wind, as Munsters would have done, but the home side were pinned in their own half as the Cookies built a 22-0 lead and had their fifth attacking bonus point by the interval through tries by Shay McCarthy (two), Luke McCready and the prolific Sligo winger Hubert Gilvarry – his ninth try in eight games. A penalty try after the break put them 29-0 lead, and two tries from Aran Egan and another from Caspar Gabriel, who converted twice, was not enough for ‘Nure to extract anything from the game, as Lansdowne’s two bonus points ultimately moved them up to third. “We definitely deserved to win and it was our most complete performance of the season,” said a relieved and happy Munsters head coach Ger Slattery. St Mary’s stayed top with a 14-0 win in Ballynahinch, Ronan Watters scoring in each half; Cork Constitution moved to fifth with a 21-15 win at Old Belvedere, Danny Sheahan scoring twice early and David Good adding a decisive 62nd minute try; while Clontarf made it seven wins in a row with a 28-12 victory at Nenagh Ormond through Alex O’Grady, Alex Usanov, Sam Owens and a penalty try.

Title: Texas Buys $5M in BTC ETF as States Edge Toward First Government Crypto Reserves
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/texas-buys-5m-in-btc-etf-as-states-edge-toward-first-government-crypto-reserves/
Time Published: 2025-12-07T17:00:00Z

The effort is starting small, but Texas made an opening foray into a state-based crypto reserve — getting closer to the first government stockpile in the U.S. Texas took a step toward building a state-based crypto reserve, grabbing $5 million of BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund, officials told CoinDesk, though the state is still setting up its Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The state recently gathered information from the crypto industry on a proper approach to building its bitcoin stockpile, and it passed legislation earlier this year appropriating $10 million to fund it, leaving only a few last steps before it potentially becomes the first of the U.S. states to begin long-term crypto investments in earnest, though others would be expected to soon join it. A few weeks ago, Texas moved past its deadline to “capture the industry’s best practices so it can utilize these practices in the implementation and management” of its bitcoin reserve, according to its formal request for information issued in September. Entities across the industry provided input on how it could set up and manage the stockpile conceived of in the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act. Last week, the state comptroller’s office moved to secure $5 million in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a placeholder, a spokesman for the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts told CoinDesk on Tuesday. It’s an opening move as the state continues to work toward a contract with a custodian, he said, which will take place after it develops its formal request for proposal. That’s not a pure bitcoin stake, and it’s not the first state entity to put government money into a crypto ETF, with other states having previously invested in such funds with public-employee retirement money. (Michigan has been building such an investment, and Wisconsin sold its $350 million pension-fund stake in the BlackRock ETF in May.) ETF purchases remain just a step removed from direct crypto holdings. New Hampshire and Arizona are also running their own efforts to stand up reserves, well ahead of the U.S. government that started the ball rolling with President Donald Trump’s rhetoric on making a long-term federal crypto investment, which started as a campaign promise and developed into an executive order. The Trump administration remains in the planning stage, and the officials assigned with pursuing the reserve are also waiting for Congress to provide some formal powers to back the effort. Though New Hampshire was first in the nation to pass legislation, it’s still working on its reserve project. “No moves have been made as of today,” said New Hampshire state Representative Keith Ammon, who has been a leading crypto advocate there, but the state has been pursuing other crypto avenues, including authorizing a $100 million bitcoin bond through the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority last week. It’s a private-sector project, but the effort is also meant to fund a crypto-backed economic development fund. Arizona has also made initial moves toward reserving crypto, with legislation earlier this year that would devote state-collected unclaimed crypto properties to build a stockpile. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, has been among those pursuing reserves across the U.S., even providing legislative frameworks state lawmakers can use. He said in an interview with CoinDesk that his group is trying to play the long game, taking incremental wins and not overreaching. “We are one of those organizations that is happy to meet lawmakers where they’re at, and if they’re not ready for it, to work on what they are ready to work on,” he said. The efforts to get states to establish crypto reserves will surge again early next year, when many of the legislatures get back to work. “You’re going to see a bunch of these states pop up when they try to do these efforts again,” he said, though a few have already been mulling proposals, such as those in Michigan and Massachusetts. Porter said he’s not yet worried that the sharp digital assets market decline will get in the way, because it hasn’t reached a “red alert” level. “I just don’t think that this drawdown is big enough for lawmakers to even have paid attention to it,” he said. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, congratulated the state in a Tuesday post on social media site X for having “bought the dip” — getting its bitcoin at an $87,000 price point after it dropped from more than $120,000.

The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals views the current environment—with Bitcoin falling back below $90,000 going into the weekend—as an opportunity to buy the asset before it inevitably regains momentum. “Right now, the message is simple and compelling,” he recently told Decrypt. “If you liked Bitcoin at $100,000 or $125,000, you have to love it at $85,000. This is the same message that advisors give their clients anytime the stock market declines, and we have seen 20%-30% declines in the S&P 500 as well.” He added: “We know that market periods of significant decline represent buying opportunities for long-term investors. The same is true here for crypto.” In a white paper released in June, Edelman recommended a 10% crypto allocation for conservative investors and up to 40% for more aggressive portfolios, shaking up a financial advisory world that has been slow to embrace digital assets. The co-founder of Edelman Financial Engines—a nearly $300 billion asset manager—had previously advocated for “low single-digits” investments in crypto, but said he had been swayed by “dramatically improved regulatory clarity and institutional engagement in crypto.” Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called Edelman’s remarks “the most important full-throated endorsement of crypto from [the] TradFi world since Larry Fink.” Holy smokes. This is the arguably the most important full throated endorsement of crypto from TradFi world since Larry Fink. This guy is Mr RIA. Manages $300b for 1.3million clients. Tops the Barron’s list of America Advisors regularly. https://t.co/3GlOpmB03z — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 30, 2025 At the time of the paper’s release, Bitcoin had surged more than 32% over a 10-week period on its way to multiple record highs, as the Trump administration’s digital asset policies reshaped the investment landscape, BTC exchange-traded funds mushroomed, and treasuries gobbled up the asset. But the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently struggled to break $90,000, falling as low as $81,000 in November as investors wrestled with macroeconomic turmoil that has weighed on risk assets. Edelman, though, has remained unbowed. He said that institutional investors’ ongoing optimism about cryptocurrencies and the widening adoption of blockchain networks underpinning these assets trumped concerns about crypto markets’ price swoon. He noted Harvard University’s regulatory filing last month showing a $116 million position in the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest ETF tracking the market, among other institutions investing in crypto and related products. “We are seeing massive levels of engagement and adoption, not just by traditional finance, but the entire Fortune 500,” Edelman said. “This can only serve to support and increase prices over the next several years.” Edelman called current price trends “routine” and no different than for other assets vulnerable to wider forces that prompt investors to take profits after lengthy price climbs. He concurred with other market observers who believe BTC sank as some early whales looked to cash in on early bets. In his white paper, Edelman predicted that Bitcoin would reach a $19 trillion market capitalization—up more than 955% from its current value of nearly $1.8 trillion—and that given rising life expectancies, even 90-year olds should consider exposure to digital assets with their decisions based on risk tolerance, not age. He said that Bitcoin’s struggles are, if anything, a sign of its maturing. “It's testimony to the fact that being lumped together with all other asset classes demonstrates better than ever that Bitcoin has become a mainstream asset, and that institutional investors are now treating Bitcoin the same way they're treating everything else,” he said. “That would not have been the case five, 10 years, or 15 years ago. The fact that it's the case today demonstrates the stability, permanence, and continued growth of crypto adoption by the institutional market.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Nearly 50% of Americans in Their Peak Earning Years Admit They Worry About Retirement Every Single Day

For many Americans, retirement is a constant worry. According to BlackRock, 47% of Americans between the ages of 45 to 54 worry about their retirement savings at least once a day. These financial moves will help to assuage some of those worries. "It’s common for Gen Xers to feel squeezed between saving for retirement and living a meaningful life now. The good news is that they are achieving peak incomes," said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Wealth. Here's how Gen Xers can move into greater retirement savings and less worry. When it comes to retirement savings, young investors have an advantage because the money they invest has the advantage of growing with compound interest over several decades. Assuming average stock market returns of 6% to 7%, every dollar you invest now can triple or quadruple by the time you retire. People in their 40s and 50s have shorter time horizons, but investing 10 to 20 years out from retirement can still make a difference in their retirement savings. If you aren't already doing so, automate your retirement savings strategy. Put aside money with each paycheck or each month, even if it's only a small amount. These steady payments can help your retirement savings grow, and they can also help to calm some of the panic you may be feeling about retirement. You should also establish an emergency fund. Put three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account, and only reach for it in times of an emergency. This will reduce the temptation to tap your retirement funds for surprise expenses, which can potentially incur hefty penalties. A 401(k) or similar tax-advantaged plan is a great way to build up your retirement savings, especially if it comes with a matching contribution from your employer. As a rule of thumb, investing 10% to 15% of each paycheck is a good goal. In 2025, you can contribute as much as $23,500 in a 401(k). This amount goes up to $70,000 when your contributions are combined with your employer's contributions. If you are in your 50s, you may invest in a catch-up contribution of $7,500 into your 401(k). Individual retirement accounts—like a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA—are other great ways to save for retirement. Both have contribution limits of $7,000 for 2025. Those age 50 older can make a catch-up contribution of $1,000. Cherry encourages Gen Xers to align their financial plans with their values, lifestyle needs, and long-term goals. "This is what I call lifestyle-aligned wealth planning. It’s not just about how much you save, but how intentionally you save," Cherry advises. "When you know your retirement rate—which is how much you need to fund [your retirement] annually—your retirement date, when you want to be work-optional, you’re no longer guessing. You’re designing your life with clarity and confidence." To get started, you'll need to be honest with yourself about the state of your retirement savings and where you would like to be headed. "The keys are being honest, giving yourself grace for where you are, being confident, and committing to where you want to go," Cherry said. For most people, the years between ages 45 and 54 are peak years for income, but many still worry about being able to afford retirement. The best way to beat these worries is through action. Start saving regularly, and contribute as much as you can to tax-advantaged retirement plans, like 401(k)s and IRA accounts. Taking charge of your investments and savings is the best way to ease your concerns about retirement.

With the rupee slipping to a record low of ₹90 against the dollar, the need to hedge your investment portfolio against currency depreciation is back in focus. This matters even more today, as Indians spend increasingly in foreign currency — on overseas vacations, education and other big-ticket needs. While the rupee has depreciated 5% against the dollar, it has historically depreciated 2.5-3% annually. Global diversification benefits from rupee depreciation, as a weakening rupee enhances the value of returns earned abroad. With mutual funds still constrained by overseas investing limits and international exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading at premiums on domestic exchanges, the usual paths to global diversification remain limited. Here’s a look at some options. Feeder funds Among domestic mutual funds, there are some feeder funds that remain open for subscription. These are funds that invest in international funds. Hence, these are called fund of funds. “However, the underlying funds are actively managed and do not offer the same comfort as investing in a broad index, where there is no risk of a fund manager underperforming the benchmark," said Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. “Earlier, investors could rely on funds tracking broad-based ETFs and indices, but those options are currently limited due to overseas investing restrictions." Also Read | Why finance keeps confusing investors: The everyday words that mislead us Remember, funds that are still open have limited headroom to invest overseas, so keep an eye out for fund announcements that indicate any breach of this headroom. Through foreign-broker routeForeign broker platforms provide an alternative path to investing in US equities and ETFs. Here, client holdings—fractional or whole—sit in pooled omnibus accounts under global custodians. Platforms such as Vested and INDMoney operate on this model. These platforms also provide access to exchange-traded funds listed on overseas exchanges, allowing investors to track a diversified index. Fractional shares work differently in this route. Investors buy a fraction of the stock’s value directly. For instance, if a share trades at $270, an investor can buy one-tenth for $27 or any other fraction. The platform aggregates investor orders, buys full shares through a US brokerage account and allocates proportional fractions to each investor. These fractions are reflected in the investor’s account, and any dividends are credited in proportion to the fraction held. This structure allows investors to participate in price movements and corporate actions without buying a full share. However, note that the underlying investments are not held in the investor’s own demat account, but in the accounts of the platform’s foreign broker partners, with the investor being the beneficiary. But, these investments are insured in US by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) up to $500,000. Gift City fundsAs of now, there is only one retail outbound fund on Gift City, which was launched by DSP MF. The minimum investment in DSP’s retail fund is $5,000 (around ₹4.5 lakh), with incremental investments of $500. This fund is available on Vested and IndMoney. However, it differs in terms of taxation. The tax impact occurs at the fund level, not the investor level. For example, if a dividend is received from an investee company, the fund must pay tax at a marginal tax rate of 35.88%. If there is a short-term gain from an investment (when the holding period is less than two years), the fund will pay a short-term capital gains tax rate of 42.74%. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate of 14.95% at the fund level. To mitigate this tax impact, the fund will maintain a cash reserve of 4-5% to facilitate exits, thereby avoiding the need to sell investee shares in the short term to meet investor redemptions. The fund will also levy an exit load on investors exiting before two years, which will be added to the fund. Recently, PPFAS received approval to launch two new retail passive funds, Gift City-based outbound funds—Parag Parikh IFSC S&P 500 FOF and Parag Parikh IFSC Nasdaq 100 FOF, but the fund house is yet to officially launch their funds. Global fundsAnother route for global exposure is through international mutual funds. These are professionally managed funds that invest across various markets, including the US, Europe, Asia, and emerging economies. Vested has begun offering global funds that are domiciled in regulated jurisdictions, such as Ireland and Luxembourg, which are widely used for cross-border fund distribution. These structures allow Indian investors to participate in global equity or fixed-income strategies without the complexity of selecting individual stocks. Also Read | RBI crafts a Goldilocks moment with surprise rate cut The process is digital: investors complete a one-time KYC, link a bank account and remit money in dollars. “Global managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity and Pimco are available, and investors can start with small ticket sizes—some as low as $10," pointed out Viram Shah, founder of Vested Finance. Stocks via Gift CityThe National Stock Exchange (NSE) IFSC provides access to only the top 50 US stocks, and the structure differs from buying a full share. Investors receive a depository receipt that represents a fraction of the underlying stock. Each stock has a depository receipt ratio that determines the minimum investment. For example, if a stock trades at $210 and the DR ratio is 1:25, investors can buy one-twenty-fifth of the share for $8.40. Corporate actions are passed on in proportion to the fraction held. On the BSE Gift City INX platform, fractional ownership is not available. India INX does not list US stocks on its exchange in the same manner as NSE IFSC does through depository receipts. Instead, India INX provides investors with access to US markets through its Global Access Program, which operates on a broker-tie-up model. Under this arrangement, India INX acts as an introducing broker. Key Takeaways International investing serves as a hedge against the rupee's historical annual depreciation of 2.5-3%. With domestic MFs hitting overseas limits, Gift City and direct foreign brokers are becoming the alternative entry points. Investments in Gift City don't require reporting under ‘Schedule FA’. Direct US investing platforms allow ‘fractional shares,’ making high-priced stocks accessible to retail investors. Advisors recommend a 10-30% global allocation, built gradually to avoid buying into market peaks. When an investor wants to buy a US stock or ETF through the platform, the order is routed to international broker partners who are licensed to execute trades on global exchanges. The shares are then held in custody through these foreign intermediaries, not as listed instruments on the India INX itself. This structure is fundamentally different from NSE IFSC, where select US stocks are made available in the form of unsponsored depository receipts that trade directly on the IFSC exchange. India INX, by contrast, provides a gateway to global markets rather than running a separate listing framework for foreign equities. TaxationAll foreign investments—except those made through Gift City—must be reported under Schedule FA (Foreign Assets) in the income-tax return. “Gift City is considered Indian territory for tax purposes. Hence, the requirement doesn’t apply to resident Indians," pointed out Harshal Bhuta, partner at P. R. Bhuta & Co. Chartered Accountants. Outside of the distinct tax rules that apply to Gift City—domiciled retail funds, foreign investments are taxed using the standard framework: gains on assets held for less than two years are treated as short-term capital gains and taxed at the investor’s slab rate, while holdings beyond two years are taxed as long-term capital gains at 12.5%. What should investors do?International exposure is crucial for mitigating the impact of the rupee’s depreciation on your investments, but it should be built with a measured approach, according to financial advisors. “While the global funds being launched in Gift City offer a useful avenue for diversification, analysing and selecting the right fund manager may be challenging for retail investors. Those who prefer a simpler route may instead consider broad-based ETFs or index funds listed on foreign exchanges, which are available on the platforms that allow foreign investments," said Dhawan.

"An ideal exposure typically ranges between 10% and 30% of the portfolio, but as US markets have already rallied sharply, investors may choose to start with a lower exposure and build it gradually," he added.

Foreign broker platforms provide an alternative path to investing in US equities and ETFs. Here, client holdings—fractional or whole—sit in pooled omnibus accounts under global custodians. Platforms such as Vested and INDMoney operate on this model. These platforms also provide access to exchange-traded funds listed on overseas exchanges, allowing investors to track a diversified index. Fractional shares work differently in this route. Investors buy a fraction of the stock’s value directly. For instance, if a share trades at $270, an investor can buy one-tenth for $27 or any other fraction. The platform aggregates investor orders, buys full shares through a US brokerage account and allocates proportional fractions to each investor. These fractions are reflected in the investor’s account, and any dividends are credited in proportion to the fraction held. This structure allows investors to participate in price movements and corporate actions without buying a full share. However, note that the underlying investments are not held in the investor’s own demat account, but in the accounts of the platform’s foreign broker partners, with the investor being the beneficiary. But, these investments are insured in US by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) up to $500,000. Gift City fundsAs of now, there is only one retail outbound fund on Gift City, which was launched by DSP MF. The minimum investment in DSP’s retail fund is $5,000 (around ₹4.5 lakh), with incremental investments of $500. This fund is available on Vested and IndMoney. However, it differs in terms of taxation. The tax impact occurs at the fund level, not the investor level. For example, if a dividend is received from an investee company, the fund must pay tax at a marginal tax rate of 35.88%. If there is a short-term gain from an investment (when the holding period is less than two years), the fund will pay a short-term capital gains tax rate of 42.74%. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate of 14.95% at the fund level. To mitigate this tax impact, the fund will maintain a cash reserve of 4-5% to facilitate exits, thereby avoiding the need to sell investee shares in the short term to meet investor redemptions. The fund will also levy an exit load on investors exiting before two years, which will be added to the fund. Recently, PPFAS received approval to launch two new retail passive funds, Gift City-based outbound funds—Parag Parikh IFSC S&P 500 FOF and Parag Parikh IFSC Nasdaq 100 FOF, but the fund house is yet to officially launch their funds. Global fundsAnother route for global exposure is through international mutual funds. These are professionally managed funds that invest across various markets, including the US, Europe, Asia, and emerging economies. Vested has begun offering global funds that are domiciled in regulated jurisdictions, such as Ireland and Luxembourg, which are widely used for cross-border fund distribution. These structures allow Indian investors to participate in global equity or fixed-income strategies without the complexity of selecting individual stocks.

Stocks via Gift CityThe National Stock Exchange (NSE) IFSC provides access to only the top 50 US stocks, and the structure differs from buying a full share. Investors receive a depository receipt that represents a fraction of the underlying stock. Each stock has a depository receipt ratio that determines the minimum investment. For example, if a stock trades at $210 and the DR ratio is 1:25, investors can buy one-twenty-fifth of the share for $8.40. Corporate actions are passed on in proportion to the fraction held. On the BSE Gift City INX platform, fractional ownership is not available. India INX does not list US stocks on its exchange in the same manner as NSE IFSC does through depository receipts. Instead, India INX provides investors with access to US markets through its Global Access Program, which operates on a broker-tie-up model. Under this arrangement, India INX acts as an introducing broker. Key Takeaways International investing serves as a hedge against the rupee's historical annual depreciation of 2.5-3%. With domestic MFs hitting overseas limits, Gift City and direct foreign brokers are becoming the alternative entry points. Investments in Gift City don't require reporting under ‘Schedule FA’. Direct US investing platforms allow ‘fractional shares,’ making high-priced stocks accessible to retail investors. Advisors recommend a 10-30% global allocation, built gradually to avoid buying into market peaks. When an investor wants to buy a US stock or ETF through the platform, the order is routed to international broker partners who are licensed to execute trades on global exchanges. The shares are then held in custody through these foreign intermediaries, not as listed instruments on the India INX itself. This structure is fundamentally different from NSE IFSC, where select US stocks are made available in the form of unsponsored depository receipts that trade directly on the IFSC exchange. India INX, by contrast, provides a gateway to global markets rather than running a separate listing framework for foreign equities. TaxationAll foreign investments—except those made through Gift City—must be reported under Schedule FA (Foreign Assets) in the income-tax return. “Gift City is considered Indian territory for tax purposes. Hence, the requirement doesn’t apply to resident Indians," pointed out Harshal Bhuta, partner at P. R. Bhuta & Co. Chartered Accountants. Outside of the distinct tax rules that apply to Gift City—domiciled retail funds, foreign investments are taxed using the standard framework: gains on assets held for less than two years are treated as short-term capital gains and taxed at the investor’s slab rate, while holdings beyond two years are taxed as long-term capital gains at 12.5%. What should investors do?International exposure is crucial for mitigating the impact of the rupee’s depreciation on your investments, but it should be built with a measured approach, according to financial advisors. “While the global funds being launched in Gift City offer a useful avenue for diversification, analysing and selecting the right fund manager may be challenging for retail investors. Those who prefer a simpler route may instead consider broad-based ETFs or index funds listed on foreign exchanges, which are available on the platforms that allow foreign investments," said Dhawan.

Title: Bitcoin hits 171 red days – What that means for 2026

Corporate treasuries now hold more BTC than major exchanges. Bitcoin’s [BTC] 2025 story isn’t quite the thriller anyone expected. But, there’s just enough to keep the market from looking away. The year looks set to stay mostly sideways, with rising volatility and sentiment stuck in fear. However, major institutions now hold over a million BTC, creating a strong floor. Sometimes, mixed signs are where the real plot twists start. Bitcoin has already logged 171 negative days in 2025, crossing its long-term average of 170 days. As Joao Wedson, CEO, Alphractal, noted in an X post, years that hit this threshold usually drift sideways into December. Source: X The data backed it up. So, the real volatility may be waiting for 2026, which isn’t too far away. Source: X But that doesn’t mean the market is quiet right now. Bitcoin’s 30-Day Volatility has jumped to 0.024, pushing above the upper band of its 1-year range for the first time since early 2024. Analysts note that this may be the start of a proper volatility expansion after months of stagnation. Building on this, the drawdown picture added good context. Source: X Bitcoin’s yearly drawdown was 25.3% at press time, far from the deep 70% to 80% corrections seen in past cycles. Here’s a potential reason why: public companies now hold 1,059,453 BTC, with Strategy alone controlling 650,000 BTC. Source: bitcointreasuries.net This level of corporate ownership effectively acts as a liquidity floor. Severe drawdowns become harder to trigger when balance sheets hold more Bitcoin than most exchanges. Even if sentiment goes weaker, the downside simply doesn’t behave the way it used to. With the structural support already in place, here’s the last piece of the puzzle. The Fear and Greed Index has been held in “fear” at 21 score for five straight weeks, similar to the eight-week fear stretch in Q1 2025 that was eventually followed by a move higher. Source: X Even with price drifting near the $84K-$90K range during these periods, sentiment hasn’t broken into panic. If anything, the chart showed Bitcoin pulling back without slipping into “extreme fear” like the reading seen on the 22nd of November. For now, the market may be anxious… but it isn’t hopeless. AMBCrypto previously reported that despite the turbulence, institutional positioning hasn’t completely retreated. Bitcoin ETFs show weak inflows, with daily net flows at just $54.8 million. This is far below previous accumulation phases. There’s also mounting pressure on giants like MicroStrategy and BlackRock, even as major players such as the National Bank of Canada increased exposure by acquiring 1.47 million MSTR shares.

Title: Letters: Ending long sponsorship link with Allianz would be an own-goal for the GAA

Insurance giant Allianz has sponsored the GAA National Leagues since 1993. Photo: Sportsfile Madam — Offaly GAA and, more recently, Roscommon GAA have submitted motions seeking to end all commercial involvement with Allianz. Several other counties, including Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone, have also passed motions urging the GAA to cease its commercial relationship with the insurance company. These developments reflect a growing movement driven by concerns over Allianz’s financial links to Israel, which has prompted a review by the GAA’s Ethics and Integrity Commission. Last March, the Institute for Palestine Studies released a report highlighting major insurance companies’ links to firms operating in Israel. The top insurers named — Allianz, Aviva, Axa, Zurich Insurance Group and RSA (Intact) — collectively channelled an estimated $1.7bn (€1.46bn) into 15 companies associated with Israeli activities. The report underscores a truth many may prefer to ignore: the world has changed so profoundly that it is virtu­ally impossible to find a multinational enterprise untouched by global geopolitical connections, including those involving Israel. If we choose to boycott these companies while simultaneously insuring our homes, cars and livelihoods through the same underwriters, and then demand that the GAA sever ties with them, are we not facing a deep contradiction? Is this not a form of self-sabotage, a gesture that makes us feel righteous while achieving nothing of substance? Ireland has zero influence over the outcome of a jihadist conflict in the Middle East. We were not at the negotiating table. We were not invited to the peace talks. Our diplomatic weight in this matter is, at best, symbolic. Given this reality, are we truly prepared to cancel our life assurance, pensions and motor and home insurance in a grand attempt to force geopolitical change? Are we genuinely that principled, or merely selectively outraged? Before we risk shooting ourselves in the foot, we must ask who exactly is driving this agenda. Allianz has been a committed sponsor of the GAA for over three decades, supporting clubs and communities in every county. Who benefits from pushing the GAA, its clubs, managers and players into a political theatre where they do not belong? Our athletes should not be distracted by global entanglements far beyond their control. They should be allowed to focus on what unites us — the joy, community and pass­ion of Gaelic football. That is where the heart of the GAA truly lies, and where it should remain. Dan Finn, Strokestown, Co Roscommon Madam — Paul Kearns cites “a report being compiled by the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland (JRCI) that details a significant rise in antisemitic incidents” (‘Swastikas in the classroom: the rise of antisemitism in Ireland’, November 30). He fails to specify what proportion of these incidents related to the state of ­Israel and not to Jews in general, a ­necessary clarification in view of the ­JRCI’s tendency to equate ­anti-Zionism with ­antisemitism. Boasting of having been “fiercely critical of the [current] Israeli government’s actions in Gaza”, Mr Kearns rejects ­descriptions of Israel as “a ­genocidal state”. However, the disenfranchisement, ethnic cleansing and “incremental genocide” (Israeli historian Ilan Pappe’s term) of Palestinians did not begin with the present government. Israel’s foundation in 1948 coincided with the Palestinian nakba, when 400 Arab-­majority villages and towns were depop­ulated. At least 750,000 Palestinians were ­expelled from their homes and denied their inalien­able right of return, which is guaranteed under international law. Mr Kearns might ponder the words of the Israeli-born author and essayist Avi Steinberg, who renounced his citizenship last year because, he said, “citizenship, of the kind I hold, has been a material piece of a long-standing genocidal ­process. The Israeli state, from its inception, has relied on the normalisation of ethnically determined supremacist laws to bolster a military regime whose clear colonial goal is the elimination of Palestine”. If Ireland is noting a rise in antisemitism, Mr Kearns should not use this to exonerate an outlaw state and to ­disparage its critics. Raymond Deane, Broadstone, Dublin 7 Madam — Paul Kearns lists the “discomforts” of antisemitism in Ireland, with Jewish people being “scared” and “afraid” and children not getting birthday party invitations. Let’s compare these “discomforts” to those of the Palestinian people: since October, 2023, the Israeli military has killed 21,263 children. None of them will ever attend a birthday parties. Tom Harper, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — The testimonies of Jewish people in Ireland quoted by Paul Kearns are disturbing. A society in which swastikas keep reappearing even after they are scrubbed off has a deeper problem than graffiti. When political tribes polarise around foreign conflicts, they import the rhetoric wholesale and apply it to neighbours who have nothing to do with the battlefield. Ireland risks drifting into that trap. The trouble with importing other people’s ­hatreds is that they often refuse to leave. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — To learn that Dublin city councillors even sugg­ested renaming Herzog Park because of its Jewish heritage is a step too far. Have they no shame? What sort of message does this send to the world? Thank you, Micheál Martin, for standing up to the councillors who, in endorsing this proposal, have shown ­ignorance and a lack of respect towards Irish Jewish ­people. Úna Heaton, Co Limerick Madam — Last Saturday, I raised the Palestinian flag on a building I own in ­Listowel to signal my support for the International Day of ­Solidarity with the Palestinian People. Meanwhile, more than 470 staff at Beaumont Hospital and 250 medical consultants across the State have backed a boycott of Teva Pharmaceuticals, an Israeli company that is a major drug supplier to the HSE. Five GAA county boards have passed motions against Allianz sponsorship because of that company’s links with Israel. Sally Rooney has said she will continue to use proceeds from her works to support Palestine Action, a proscribed organisation in the UK, even if the sale of her books could be outlawed. Rooney, along with Bob ­Vylan, Kneecap, Liam Cunningham, Naoise Dolan and others, are doing what our political leaders and some sycophants in the press are unwilling or afraid to face up to. Yet Eilis O’Hanlon says if Sinn Féin wants to be taken seriously as a party of government it “needs to grow up and start acting like one” (‘Sinn Féin has the political personality of a stroppy student’, November 30). With all due respect to your columnist, she is way behind the curve on this one. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Full marks to RTÉ and the other national broadcasters that have decided to boycott next year’s Eurovision Song Contest because of Israel’s participation. I hope the Irish Government will follow RTÉs principled action and stop stalling over the Occupied Territories Bill. Breasal Ó Caollaí, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Madam — By boycotting Eurovision, RTÉ is exceeding its legislative authority. Its all-out political stance on Israel participating in a song contest is far beyond its role. RTÉ is a public service broadcasting monopoly and it is incumbent upon it to provide unbiased and impartial journ­alism and coverage. That has gone completely out the window with the Eurovision. Maurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork Madam —Peter Vandermeersch was so right about Donald Trump (‘Journalists must always challenge Trump’s cynical shrug in the face of evil’, November 23), and the response by your reader Paul Byrne was also totally correct (Letters, November 30). The US is a huge country in every way. Every other nation is ­required to pay close attention to what is happening there. Nowadays, it has gone beyond that. We now see national leaders as supplicants, metaphorically on their knees to stay in favour with the US president. His personality requires ­constant praise. If democratic leaders demur, he will get it from despots and autocrats and will overlook their behaviour, no matter how egregious. Anthony Hanrahan, Salruck, Renvyle, Co Galway Madam — Colin Murphy laments the “growing gap between citizens and their political representatives (‘MetroLink showdown exposes the missing connection in our public life’, November 30). He should take account of the Constitution, which refers to separation of powers within our democratic structures: the Government legislates and the courts adjudicate. Would he prefer Ireland did away with this to follow the example of autocratic and authoritarian states? Sean Darcy, Celbridge, Co Kildare Madam — Willie O’Dea’s column (‘Defence Forces’ decline is a global embarrassment that must be reversed’, November 30) brought a wry smile. Better that, I decided, than a fluster of frustration at my time of life. First, as this article related to the Defence Forces and nat­ional defence issues, it should have been stated that Mr O’Dea is a former defence minister (September 2004 to February 2010). He is among a long line of ministers who have left the Def­ence Forces, “by increments”, to use his phrase, with a weakened and limited capacity in a world where the rule of law is constantly being diminished. It is regrettable that Mr O’Dea, rather than being infam­ously remembered for being photographed in November 2005 jokingly aiming a pistol at a press photographer, didn’t bring some of his current thinking to the cabinet table some years ago. He could have helped to rev­erse the decline of the Defence Forces, which was obvious at the beginning of the millenni­um and during his time as minister. Michael Gannon (Defence Forces, retired), St Thomas Square, Kilkenny Madam — Reading Willie O’Dea’s article on the weakening of the Defence Forces, I must agree with his sentiments. If the problem isn’t add­ressed, we could find ourselves staring down the barrel of a gun. Sorry, Willie. Noel Kelly, Doonbeg, Co Clare Madam — Roslyn Dee’s article (‘Trespasses brought back the division, violence and killing of my homeplace’, People & Culture, November 30) took me back to May 17, 1974. I refer, of course, to the Dublin bombings. I was working in a shop on Capel Street and at close of business, as a colleague and I left, we heard a dreadful muffled boom, the site of the atrocity being but a 15-minute walk from where we stood. To this day, I can clearly hear my colleague say: “Jesus, Tom, that sounds like a bomb.” We hastened to my Austin Mini and headed off up Dorset Street as fast as the traffic allowed. Thankfully, I did not lose a relative or friend that day, but later learned that a gentleman who worked for the same company suffered the heartbreaking loss of his daughter. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Madam — “Beannachtaí an tSéasúir” said no one ever ­(‘Furore over festive lights name can’t dim my love of winter’, ­November 30). This “blessing” may exist in the imagination or the vast vault of Naoise Dolan’s wishful thinking, but it’s not real. Among Irish language speakers, you will sometimes hear “Beannachtaí na ­Nollag”. This too, is not top-drawer Irish, but at least it is in popular use. P Kelly, Carraroe, Co Galway Madam — With the departure of Paschal Donohoe and before him Michael McGrath, there have been many commentators bemoaning the loss of these two highly rated ministers. I would humbly suggest using the ­Seanad to attract more talent into national politics. Every political party and Dáil grouping could create a list of people with specialist expertise along the lines of Seanad election panels, such as agriculture. The election of people from this list would be based on the overall percentage that a party or ­Independents as a whole ­received in a general election. Inclusion on the list would be based on regional caucuses and votes by party members or registered independent citizens. This could attract the kind of people we need to scrutinise and improve legislation and give ­citizens a real involvement in the make-up of the Seanad. I believe this or a form of a list system could offer the Seanad far greater relevance. Criostoir McGrath, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — The UK’s National Energy System ­Operator has ­reported “an emerging risk to gas supply security from 2030 to 2036”. By the 2030s, we will be nearly wholly reliant on the UK for natural gas. In this context, Eoin O’Malley’s column (‘Reaction will be harsh, but it’s time our energy went nuclear’, November 30) was a timely reminder that we need a contingency power source. Is the Government being reckless by not putting in place an energy strategy that includes nuclear? Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Shane Ross admits Simon Harris was a good councillor and a diligent TD, then resorts to the same old criticism (‘How Harris can escape last-chance saloon’, November 30). I wonder what Mr Ross was like as a TD, but can draw my own conclusions from the fact the voters of Dublin Rathdown dismissed him at the 2020 general election. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo

Title: Bitcoin enters extreme volatility – Why institutions refuse to back down

Heavyweights under pressure: Why institutional moves are key for BTC. The crypto market is swinging hard between fear and extreme fear. December came in hot, with Bitcoin [BTC] ripping +8%. However, the momentum rolled over almost instantly. Now HODLers are trying to figure out whether this is just a liquidity sweep or the start of a deeper trend breakdown. Bulls completely lost the $90k support block, which basically shows how thin BTC‘s bid side is right now. And the volatility is echoed in BTC ETF flows, showing no sustained inflow trend, no real directional conviction. Source: SoSo Value Notably, this is where the real divergence kicks in. In previous accumulation phases, BTC pullbacks were backed by solid ETF demand. As the chart shows, daily net inflows usually started around $500 million and eventually ramped to $1 billion as BTC pushed toward the top. But this cycle is a different story. Daily net flows are sitting at just $54.8 million, which signals how weak the current demand side really is. Given this setup, how are institutions positioning themselves to stay resilient? Recent market FUD hasn’t spared Bitcoin’s heavyweight holders. MicroStrategy [MSTR] is the standout example here. Ever since it lost the $450 level back in mid-July, the stock has been stuck in a steady downtrend. At press time, MSTR was trading around $178. Notably, MSTR isn’t the only one under pressure. BlackRock has unloaded 26k BTC since October, marking its most aggressive sell phase on record. In short, the recent FUD has put a strong share of institutions under stress. Source: TradingView (MSTR/USD) The result? Bitcoin HODLers are basically stuck in indecision. In this setup, the billions flowing out of BTC ETFs aren’t random. With weak bid support, slipping stock performance, and broad FUD, investors are clearly sitting on the sidelines instead of backing Bitcoin heavyweights. The logic is simple: Unlike private HODLers, public firms feel the pressure much harder. As these BTC-heavy companies keep bleeding capital, the risk of a wider sell-off can’t be ignored. That’s why tracking their moves is critical. As volatility ramps up, all eyes are on the big leagues. But recent moves suggest BTC heavyweights might be weathering the market chop more smoothly than many expect. Case in point: The National Bank of Canada just made a big splash. In a strategic move, the $398 billion institution scooped up 1.47 million shares of MSTR, worth about $273 million, boosting its BTC treasury exposure and showing confidence in navigating the turbulent market. Source: SoSo Value Notably, BlackRock isn’t far behind. A prominent analyst recently highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT generated $245 million in revenue despite $2.7 billion in outflows over five weeks, clearly showing how the firm is capitalizing on market swings. Why does this matter? Sustained revenue lets BlackRock keep scaling positions. In short, despite the Bitcoin crash, its heavyweights are strategizing, showing they are navigating Bitcoin volatility strategically.

Title: Citadel pushes SEC to classify open-source developers as unregistered stockbrokers – Uniswap fires back

Citadel's Dec. 2 filing urges the SEC not to grant broad exemptions for tokenized-equity trading on DeFi, Hayden Adams says TradFi is coming for open-source builders. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Dec. 2, Citadel Securities filed a 13-page letter with the SEC arguing that decentralized protocols facilitating tokenized US equity trading already meet statutory definitions of exchanges and broker-dealers, and regulators should treat them accordingly. Two days later, the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee convened a panel on tokenized equities that made clear the question is no longer whether stocks can move on-chain, but whether they can do so without dismantling the permissionless architecture that built DeFi. The gap between those two positions now defines the most consequential regulatory fight in crypto since the Howey test debates. Citadel’s letter arrived at the moment when tokenized equities stopped being a thought experiment. The firm welcomes tokenization in principle but insists that realizing its benefits requires applying “the key bedrock principles and investor protections that underpin the fairness, efficiency, and resiliency of US equity markets.” In other words, the document suggests that companies seeking to trade tokenized Apple shares must comply with Nasdaq rules, including transparent fees, consolidated tape reporting, market surveillance, fair access, and registration as an exchange or broker-dealer. The filing warns that granting broad exemptive relief to DeFi platforms creates a shadow US equity market in which liquidity fragments, retail investors lose Exchange Act protections, and incumbents face regulatory arbitrage from unregistered competitors. Within hours, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams fired back on X, calling Citadel’s position an attempt to “treat software developers of decentralized protocols like centralized intermediaries.” He invoked ConstitutionDAO, the 2021 crowdfunding effort that pooled $47 million in Ethereum to bid on a first-edition Constitution at Sotheby’s, only to lose to Griffin’s $43.2 million bid. Additionally, Adams zeroed in on Citadel’s fair-access argument, calling it “actual nerve” from the dominant player in retail order flow. The exchange captured crypto’s core narrative of permissionless code versus gatekeeper control and set the terms for the Dec. 4 panel. Citadel walks through the Exchange Act’s definitions to make its case. An exchange is “any organization, association, or group of persons” that “provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities.” Rule 3b-16 clarifies that a system operates as an exchange if it brings together orders using established, non-discretionary methods and if buyers and sellers agree to trade. Citadel argues many DeFi protocols meet all three prongs: there is a “group of persons” behind the protocol (founding designers, governance organizations, foundations), the protocol brings together buyers and sellers via non-discretionary code (automated market makers, on-chain order books), and users agree to trade when they submit transactions. The same logic extends to broker-dealer status. Citadel catalogs DeFi trading apps, wallet providers, AMMs, liquidity providers, searchers, validators, protocol developers, and smart contract developers. For each, it lists transaction-based fees, governance-token rewards, or order-routing payments. The implication is that protocols that collect revenue tied to securities trading, even through code, must register. That framing aligns with the SEC’s 2024 enforcement action against Rari Capital, which charged a DeFi lending protocol and its founders with acting as unregistered brokers. Citadel wants Rari to serve as the template. The fair access requirement became the flashpoint. Exchanges and ATSs must apply objective criteria to all users, removing discrimination in who can trade and the fees they pay. Citadel’s letter notes that there are “no equivalent requirements for unregistered DeFi trading systems, enabling them to limit access arbitrarily or preference certain members over others.” Adams chose that paragraph for his screenshot, arguing that Citadel cannot credibly claim DeFi lacks fair access when the firm itself dominates retail order flow from brokers like Robinhood. Armani Ferrante, founder of Backpack, added: “‘DeFi’ is not well defined and so all of these conversations are an apples to oranges comparisons. There’s CEXs. Unregulated CEXs. DEXs. And unregulated CEXs pretending to be DEXs.” The SEC Investor Advisory Committee meeting framed tokenized equities within a mainstream market structure rather than treating them as a crypto novelty. The panel, moderated by Andrew Park and John Gulliver, brought together representatives from Coinbase, BlackRock, Robinhood, Nasdaq, Citadel Securities, and Galaxy Digital. The agenda tested how issuance, trading, clearing, settlement, and investor protections could work under existing rules, with an explicit focus on native issuance versus wrapper models, Regulation NMS applicability, interoperability across chains, and settlement and short-selling mechanics. Commissioner Crenshaw delivered the skeptical case. She noted that many tokenized equity products marketed as wrapped exposure are not one-to-one replicas of the underlying shares, with ownership rights and entitlements that can be unclear or disconnected from issuers. Additionally, she questioned whether relaxing requirements simply because a product sits on a blockchain invites regulatory arbitrage. That framing dovetails with the agenda’s emphasis on distinguishing true equity-like rights from lookalike tokens. Chairman Paul Atkins countered by pitching tokenization as a modernization project for US capital markets, arguing the Commission should enable markets to move on-chain while keeping US leadership in global finance. Outside the meeting, incumbent resistance sharpened. The World Federation of Exchanges warned the SEC against broad relief that would let crypto firms sell tokenized stocks without the traditional regulatory perimeter. SIFMA echoed a technology-neutral line, supporting innovation but arguing that tokenized securities should remain subject to core investor-protection and market-integrity rules and that any exemptions should be narrow. Nasdaq’s earlier proposal to treat qualifying tokenized shares as fungible with traditional shares on the same order book, with the same CUSIP and the same material rights, aligns with the direction Atkins appears to favor. Citadel’s theory holds that a security is a security, regardless of the ledger. If you bring together buyers and sellers of Apple shares, even tokenized, using automated code and collecting fees, you perform exchange or broker-dealer functions and should meet those obligations. This view treats code as infrastructure, not ideology. It assumes that investor protection flows from intermediary accountability rather than from technical design. Adams’s theory treats open-source code as distinct from intermediaries. A smart contract does not have customers, does not take custody, does not exercise discretion, and does not fit the Exchange Act’s mid-20th-century model. Treating protocol developers as brokers conflates writing software with operating a business and hands incumbents veto power over which technologies can exist. This view assumes protection flows from transparency and permissionlessness: anyone can audit the code, fork it, or build competing infrastructure. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, has staked out a position closer to Adams. In a February statement, she stated that ordinary DeFi front-end builders and open-source developers should not automatically be held to exchange and broker standards just for publishing code or running a non-custodial UI. Yet Citadel’s letter explicitly lists “DeFi protocol developers” and “smart contract developers” as potential intermediaries who design, deploy, and maintain infrastructure while collecting fees for executing trades, exercising governance rights, and prioritizing network traffic. If deploying a smart contract that lets users trade tokenized stocks makes someone a broker-dealer subject to net-capital rules, custody requirements, and know-your-customer obligations, then open-source protocol development becomes legally untenable. The signal for 2026 is that the SEC will test whether tokenized equities can exist inside the same investor-rights and market-integrity architecture that governs today’s equities. Atkins has floated an innovation exemption, a supervised sandbox that would let some tokenized equity platforms operate without full registration while the agency studies the risks. The Dec. 4 panel framed that exemption as a compliance stress test, not a blanket waiver. The big unresolved fight is whether innovation pathways will be tightly tethered to Regulation NMS and existing intermediary obligations, or whether the SEC will entertain broader experimental carve-outs that TradFi groups fear could fragment liquidity and weaken protections. If the SEC sides with Citadel, DeFi protocols handling tokenized equities face compliance burdens designed for Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, driving activity offshore or into gray-market wrappers. If it sides with Adams, traditional participants will argue that the agency created regulatory arbitrage, and litigation from SIFMA and the World Federation of Exchanges will follow. The outcome decides whether tokenized US equities can trade on public blockchains under the permissionless ethos that built DeFi, or whether opening the stock market to on-chain settlement means closing DeFi’s open architecture in America.

Title: VUSLAT BAYOGLU | Follow the money, not Trump & Co
URL: https://www.sundaytimes.timeslive.co.za/business/news/2025-12-06-follow-the-money-not-trump-co/
Time Published: 2025-12-06T18:00:25Z
Full Content:
The year 2025 began with two important developments that tell a story about the complex relationships — political and commercial — between the US and South Africa. Donald Trump was inaugurated on January 20. Three days later, Coca-Cola, America’s largest soft drink multinational, and South African Rugby announced an investment in the form of sponsorship for the Springboks. Coincidentally, the four-year deal corresponds with Trump’s presidential four-year term. Since his inauguration, Trump has earned a reputation in South Africa as a racially divisive figure who lies about white genocide. He even invented an exclusive refugee programme for the imaginary “victims”. On the other hand, by striking a partnership with the Springboks, Coca-Cola has taken a positive stand not only about South Africa but about its own corporate aspirations. It sees immense value in associating with our world rugby champions, who are the symbol of the country’s rich talents, pooled from diverse communities. The Springboks bust the myth of racial intolerance and genocide that Trump and his South African right-wing supporters are peddling. They symbolise national unity. Trump’s attempt to undermine South Africa is in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm expressed by Coca-Cola and other US multinationals that have shown confidence in South Africa. BlackRock, the largest US investment firm, now holds the biggest share of Eskom’s foreign bonds. US retail giant Walmart has begun rolling out stores in South Africa, having acquired wholesale group Massmart a few years ago. It has stated that it seeks to champion “inclusive growth”. The big US banks are also rooting for South Africa with their money. Citigroup has increased its stake in Absa to 5%. Goldman Sachs, which held an investment conference in South Africa, has increased its client base. While Trump talks and acts negatively, even going as far as withdrawing his administration from the G20 summit, US companies act positively. The country’s corporate diplomacy differs sharply from Trump’s arbitrary politics And automaker Ford is expanding its production line in Pretoria. These and other US companies are led by smart leaders who see mutually beneficial value in South Africa. They are not saying we are perfect. No country is. While Trump talks and acts negatively, even going as far as withdrawing his administration from the G20 summit, US companies act positively. The country’s corporate diplomacy differs sharply from Trump’s arbitrary politics. Trump is not alone in his misguided views. He is in the company of a small but loud group of white Afrikaners who moan about the democratic dispensation while displaying unashamed apartheid nostalgia. They refuse to acknowledge that the political deal that Nelson Mandela and the ANC struck with their apartheid-era oppressors protects property rights, including land ownership. Expropriation for various legitimate purposes is a tried and tested method of acquiring land all over the world, including in the US. In South Africa, we have the advantage of an independent judiciary to adjudicate disputes that may arise regarding the quantum of compensation. It’s ironic that AfriForum and Solidarity would choose to lobby Trump’s America to take a stance against South Africa by spreading lies about land expropriation as if it were some random thing that can be done outside judicial review. There has never been arbitrary expropriation in South Africa, and it’s not about to happen. The right-wing groups even went to the extent of erecting banners for G20 visitors to see, claiming that South Africa was governed by race-based policies. Instead of blaming the apartheid regime for saddling democratic South Africa with racial imbalances — economic, social and access to opportunities — the right-wing lobby groups are condemning the democratic state for attempting to address the apartheid legacy. Yes, the redress mechanisms aren’t perfect. But leaving the apartheid legacy intact would be dangerous. It could fuel resentment and contribute to instability. Is this what the Right wishes? How else can we explain the glee with which it exaggerates South Africa’s problems by peddling lies and campaigning against its interests? Despite South Africa’s problems, many of which the country has the capacity to solve, it remains a relatively stable country. It is one in which US companies and others around the world can invest and get returns. Many problems persist — unemployment, crime, corruption and bureaucratic red tape. Yet they do not justify racist and unpatriotic campaigns that seek to divide rather than build. By campaigning against South Africa, and going around complaining about the mild transformation programmes of the ANC, the right-wing groups are inviting more trouble than they realise. Their campaigns could trigger the emergence of an extreme version of Julius Malema, who they despise for talking about the nationalisation of land and for occasionally singing “kill the boer”, an old song that democratic South Africa is happy to ignore in favour of fashionable amapiano, gospel and other genres. The right-wing groups must not make “kill the boer” fashionable again with their apartheid nostalgia. We must build on the constitutional foundation of nonracialism. The good thing is that US corporate leaders appear to be ignoring the right-wing groups. By cutting through the clutter of lies peddled by Trump and his fanatical supporters in South Africa, by building bridges and making objective investment cases on behalf of their clients and shareholders, US multinationals are showing the way. • Bayoglu is MD of Menar, an investment company with interests in mining and ferromanganese production Would you like to comment on this article?Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.

Title: Wall Street will be dragged to blockchain ‘kicking and screaming,’ Fidelity CEO says

Time Published: 2025-12-06T15:56:45Z

About us Copy link The CEO of a $15 trillion Wall Street giant just called traditional finance “really kind of scary.” Abigail Johnson, who runs Fidelity, says the current financial system is the most complicated web of basically reconciliation processes built on “primitive technology” — and that blockchain will eventually replace it. But it won’t be an easy path. “It’s got to be an evolutionary process and it’ll be some combination of competitive forces and regulatory standards that will kind of push it kicking and screaming along,” Johnson said at an A16Z crypto event on December 4. Johnson’s critique reveals how even traditional finance leaders see the current system as fundamentally broken. The industry is trapped at the “lowest common denominator” of decades-old technology, with a combination of inertia and the inability of smaller players to upgrade that’s keeping everything intact. Cue blockchain, a technology that Johnson has been betting on since 2013. But enthusiastic blockchain adoption alone won’t push the industry, according to Johnson. Instead, it will be a forced migration. For one, competitive forces means that institutions who don’t upgrade lose market share to those that do. If one bank offers instant settlement with a blockchain while competitors take three days using legacy systems, customers will move their business. If one brokerage can custody Bitcoin while another can’t, advisors and clients interested in crypto assets will go elsewhere. Fidelity, with Johnson at the helm, experienced those headwinds firsthand. The firm faced “surprisingly immature but very loud” anti-crypto sentiment from traditional finance leaders for years, Johnson said. “I just had to be patient and keep going and that the noise would pass.” Indeed, the noise has passed. In the past year, some of Wall Street’s biggest banks have begun to experiment with crypto, while digital asset treasuries and exchange-traded funds have deployed billions to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. Then there’s regulatory standards. These mean governments mandate improvements for the characteristics that blockchain enables — be it transparency, settlement speed, or interoperability. Across the world, regulation is already coming into effect. In the US, the Genius Act is already operating while the market structure bill, dubbed Clarity Act, awaits approval from the Senate, hopefully by early 2026. And in Europe, MiCA has been active since late 2024. At its core, the problem isn’t necessarily that financial institutions don’t want to upgrade. It’s that they can’t. “There’s a real kind of existential challenge for the industry because at least some of the bigger players would like to upgrade the broader infrastructure a little faster,” Johnson said. “But the industry is a democratic place and there’s a lot of small players who just don’t have the wherewithal to participate in that kind of an upgrade.” Since everything is interconnected, the weakest link determines the system’s overall capabilities. And that weakest link is stuck on decades-old technology. Fidelity has been betting on blockchain for over a decade. In 2013, the firm pioneered Bitcoin custody services for its clients, while setting up mining operations. Fidelity’s Bitcoin mining outlet, in fact, has given the firm “probably the highest single highest ROI business” Johnson said. The company’s ETF, FBTC, holds the second most Bitcoin after BlackRock, with around $20 billion in assets under management, according to Dune Analytics. Fidelity recently launched a tokenised money market fund designed to interoperate with stablecoins, allowing clients to earn yield then flip into crypto when needed. And in mid November, the firm saw its new Solana ETF debut. Still, Johnson admitted she underestimated how long the transition would take. “I didn’t fully appreciate how slow change really is in our traditional business because there’s just so many forces that keep everybody kind of together and tight doing what they’ve always been doing,” she said.

Title: Crypto Sell-Off: Binance, Coinbase, Dump Over $2 Billion In Bitcoin As Prices Dip Below $90,000
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sell-off-binance-dump-over-2-billion-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-12-06T12:00:54Z

The cryptocurrency market experienced another wave of liquidations on Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) prices dipping below the critical support level of $90,000. This decline followed a brief rally that had seen its price rise approximately $3,000 above this threshold earlier in the week. Data from CoinGlass reveals that nearly $430 million in liquidations occurred across the crypto market over the past 24 hours, predominantly affecting leveraged long positions, which accounted for about $350 million. During this period, Bitcoin underwent a 3.5% retracement, with its price settling at just above $89,120—a stark 29% below its all-time high of over $126,000 reached in October. Market expert OxNobler recently highlighted the role of both retail and institutional investors in this downturn. In a post on social media platform X, OxNobler detailed the reason behind Bitcoin’s decline: significant sell-offs by major players. According to the analyst, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, sold 4,000 BTC; U.S.-based Coinbase (COIN) liquidated 5,675 BTC; and traditional finance giant Fidelity sold 3,288 BTC. Additionally, market maker Wintermute offloaded 1,793 BTC. Notably, the analyst pointed out that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which is the largest public company holder of Bitcoin with over 650,000 coins, has also sold over 3,820 coins in this same time frame. The firm’s sell-off comes on the heels of speculation regarding Strategy’s potential to liquidate some of its holdings due to the substantial losses affecting its financial performance amid declining Bitcoin prices. When Strategy CEO Phong Le was questioned about the possibility of selling off Bitcoin, he acknowledged that while the firm’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, has consistently opposed selling, circumstances may change if the company’s stock trades below the net value of its Bitcoin holdings, which aligns with the recent actions taken by the firm. Interestingly, while these institutional sell-offs have contributed to the current market dip, Coinbase’s institutional division has projected a potential recovery for the crypto market in December, citing improving liquidity, a 92% probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting rates, and supportive macroeconomic conditions. Analysts have pointed out several reasons for optimism, including the recovery of liquidity, the resilience of the “AI bubble,” and the attractiveness of short US dollar trades at current levels. However, OxNobler warned that the situation may not be so straightforward. Alongside the activities of major institutions, he noted that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had recently sold $130 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, seems to have resumed selling Ethereum, with millions of ETH being moved from the foundation’s wallet through Gnosis Safe. Ultimately, OxNobler asserts that these institutional activities may have a hand in manipulating crypto prices and preventing them from climbing to higher levels and key resistance points.

Title: Why BlackRock’s $125M Bitcoin move has BTC traders on edge

Time Published: 2025-12-06T11:00:02Z

BlackRock’s routine transfers mask bearish signals as RSI and MACD confirm short-term selling momentum dominance. The crypto market is showing strain. After failing to stay above $94,000, Bitcoin [BTC] fell 2.6% to a low of around $89,596, as of press time. At the same time, Ethereum [ETH] mirrored the move with a 3.72% drop to $3,038. This sharp correction has fueled fear among retail investors. Yet, behind the panic, institutional giants are increasing their commitments and doubling down. On the 5th of December, BlackRock deposited $125.5 million in BTC and $2.5 million in ETH to Coinbase. Analyst Ted Pillows warns that this could precede an institutional selling wave, potentially adding further instability. He said, “More selling?” And, hence, a question arises: Is the current dip a signal for deeper selling, or is it simply smart money quietly defining the new, higher floor of this ETF-driven cycle? The recent price drop, following Bitcoin’s inability to hold the $94,000 level, has inevitably focused attention on large institutional movements, specifically, BlackRock’s multi-million dollar deposit of BTC and ETH to Coinbase. In the crypto market, large transfers to exchanges are quickly seen as bearish, mainly due to liquidation risk, since they increase the supply that could be sold. With ETF outflows and macro uncertainty already heightening nerves, the market reacts sharply to such movements. So, if institutions did liquidate, the added supply could push prices lower, a fear reinforced by past cases where big deposits preceded corrections. For retail investors, seeing major funds move assets onto trading platforms often signals trouble ahead. However, this panic misses a key point: managing multi-billion-dollar ETFs often requires routine transfers that have nothing to do with imminent selling. However, a deposit alone does not automatically equate to further sales. For an ETF issuer like BlackRock, such fund movements often reflect routine operational needs, custody adjustments, redemption processing, rebalancing, or other internal workflows. BlackRock relies on Coinbase Prime for institutional custody and high‑volume trading, reflecting a systematic strategy rather than panic selling. Often, such large transfers are routine steps in ETF creation and redemption processes designed to keep prices aligned. Even so, technical indicators continue to suggest a bearish outlook in the short term. At the time of writing, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) were lying below their neutral levels, confirming the dominance of selling momentum in the short-to-medium term. Source: Trading View To decisively flip the market narrative from “bear in control” to “bullish breakout,” Bitcoin must successfully cross and hold the key resistance level at $98,000. Until then, the market remains technically subdued and vulnerable to volatility.

Title: ‘You can hear the stress in people’s voices’: St Vincent de Paul’s 900 calls for help in a single morning

A single mother with three young children is “struggling with food costs and very anxious about Christmas”. A father of four young children is “very upset” because his €244 weekly disability allowance has been cut by €80. An elderly woman who has custody of her two grandchildren has “nothing left for food” after paying her bills. These are among the stories heard on more than 900 calls for help made during a single morning this week to the St Vincent de Paul eastern region call centre in Dublin. The centre, on Sean McDermott Street in the north inner city, takes calls from counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. It will receive about 1,500 by the day’s end from households “desperately struggling and stressed”, says Sinead Gill, the information lead for the region. “We are up 7 per cent on the number of calls since last year. Nationally, there were 250,000 calls in 2024 and, as usual, we are exceptionally busy at Christmas,” she says. “People are finding it really, really tough, especially without the extra double-payments. They were a huge help last year, but they’re gone,” she adds, referring to the two double-payment child benefits paid in late 2024 but not repeated in this year’s budget in October. [ Saint Vincent de Paul expects over a quarter of a million Christmas calls for helpOpens in new window ] The housing crisis and the “inadequacy” of social welfare rates to meet basic needs are key drivers of poverty, says Gill. “You can hear the stress in people’s voices. People are finding it so, so hard to cover the costs of basics like food, heat and even winter clothes for their kids.” Kate Darcy, one of five information support officers on duty, takes 13 calls over a 25-minute period. If a caller is on her database, she checks their details before reassuring them a volunteer will contact them to arrange a visit before Christmas. If someone is a first-time caller, she takes details of their situation. “You’re a couple with four children?,” she asks a mother. “You are all right. No don’t apologise,” she adds “Look, I have you down for the Christmas help. We don’t have a date yet for that area but they will be out and they will call you. Keep your phone on. God bless.” Another mother calls. “It’s three children you have? And you are struggling in general? I know, I know. I really do ... No problem at all, love; don’t be worrying.” An older woman in north Dublin calls. “Are your grandchildren still there with you? They are. And how can I help you?” Darcy explains after the call that the woman missed a visit from volunteers the previous evening. “I will get them to give you a ring back ... No problem at all. Take care,” she tells the woman, On her screen a log of locations from which calls have come this morning includes areas all over Dublin: Cherry Orchard; Tallaght; Swords; Crumlin; Rathmines; Chapelizod; from Priorswood on the north side of the city to Rialto on the south side; and from Malahide in north Co Dublin down to Bray in Co Wicklow, and as far as Athy in Co Kildare. “You get calls from every area – most are from the more struggling areas, but we get calls too from Foxrock, Ranelagh, Blackrock, Killiney,” she says, referring to areas of Dublin known for their affluence. “There isn’t an area we haven’t had a call from.” Jackie Ryan, who is logging email requests for help, has had more than 1,000 since last week. “All need help with food – that or electric, or gas.” She reads some out, withholding names of senders. A mother in Dublin 10 writes: “I am looking for help for myself and my two boys. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.” Another mother, in Dublin 8, says: “Dear Vincent de Paul, I am writing to yous to request help. I am struggling immensely keeping up with bills and groceries. I am very concerned with how I am going to afford to buy my son’s presents this year considering I have not been able to save due to being so tight on money. [ ‘Why shouldn’t everyone have some nice things at Christmas?’: A day on a charity food runOpens in new window ] “I have applied for a part-time job to suits my son’s hours in school to no avail. I am under so much pressure. Any help would be highly appreciated.” “She is struggling big time,” says Ryan. “God love her.” A man in his 70s, living alone, writes: “My wife died last year. I am finding it hard on my income.” A single mother is in homeless accommodation with her daughter. “She will be three in January. I was looking for any sort of help possible for Christmas, anything at all would be greatly appreciated, so much.” Appeals for help also come in by post. Darcy reads one, written on a page torn from a child’s school copybook. “I am a full-time carer. My son has [a] disease and my grandson [lives with us]. I would greatly appreciate any help or a food voucher. I have an open fireplace if you could help me with some coal or turf. Thank you kindly.” Some of the calls can be “very distressing” for call-takers says Margo Duffy, who has been with the society for more than a decade. “There will be the odd one that just gets you. It is only when you are working in a job like this that you realise there is so much stress out there, so much poverty,” she says. The charity continues to welcome donations, of money and new toys, says Gill. “We also need more volunteers. Unfortunately, we cannot visit everyone who calls for help this Christmas because we just don’t have enough volunteers,” she says. “That is very hard.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s $28.7M ETH buy signals a new era – What’s cooking?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551532
Time Published: 2025-12-06T03:00:25Z
Full Content:
Why are giants like BlackRock and BitMine racing to amass millions of ETH? BlackRock’s latest $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum is drawing global attention. However, its true significance is being missed. This move is not a speculative gamble on a token’s price. Instead, it is a strategic signal about Ethereum’s established role as critical financial infrastructure. Moving beyond Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, BlackRock is classifying Ethereum as a key platform. It also means that BlackRock is not simply investing in a token. Instead, it is actively validating Ethereum’s role as the world’s leading financial ledger for tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs). The company must have acquired $28.78 million worth of ETH to support its growing digital products, particularly the BUIDL fund. Especially since this fund operates entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, running such a large on-chain product requires BlackRock to maintain a deep, continuous supply of Ethereum’s native gas – ETH. According to Arkham Intelligence data, BlackRock now holds a massive position of 3,944,794 ETH – Making it the third-largest holder globally after the Eth2 Beacon Deposit Contract and Binance. This institutional focus is juxtaposed against the aggressive accumulation strategy of corporate treasuries like BitMine Immersion. The firm, which is the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, recently added 69,822 ETH. In doing so, it boosted its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, while hitting 60% of its “Alchemy of 5%” supply target. Meanwhile, on the price front, ETH was trading near $3,123.46 on the charts. This, after a minor downtick at press time. However, the momentary price action may have been overshadowed by the long-term bullish sentiment fueled by these institutional moves. BlackRock recently made news for its latest buy-in, confirming that Ethereum is evolving as the active foundation for mainstream, on-chain finance. The simultaneous on-chain movement of $589 million in BTC and ETH (received from Coinbase) does not reflect a “market flush.” Instead, ETF redemption mechanics directly drive these transfers. These large transfers, even with BTC near $90,898 and ETH above $3,000 at press time, reveal a key truth. They show that visible crypto movements often represent capital exiting the ETF system, rather than entering it. This resulting market volatility does not signal weakness. On the contrary, they highlights how crypto is transitioning into a mature, institutionally-plumbed financial system.

Title: Will Solana’s price hit $500 after Vanguard’s SOL ETF decision?

Time Published: 2025-12-06T01:00:43Z

Vanguard’s SOL ETF – Betting on fundamentals amid volatility? With back-to-back ETFs, the crypto market is entering one of its most aggressive adoption phases yet. Notably, this momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin [BTC]. Instead, institutions are finally diversifying into altcoins too. Even without a confirmed “altcoin season,” the data has been seeing steady institutional demand. Solana [SOL] is leading the charge, having rolled out six spot SOL ETFs in Q4 and pulled in about $622 million in inflows so far. Notably, almost 95% of that capital has gone into Bitwise’s BSOL ETF, effectively positioning it as the BlackRock-tier heavyweight of the Solana ecosystem. In short, 2025 has finally brought altcoins into the spotlight. Source: Farside Investors Building on this momentum is Vanguard Group. For context, Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, managing over $11 trillion and serving more than 50 million investors. In a significant policy shift, the firm has opened its platform to crypto ETFs. Announced on 02 December, this move reverses Vanguard’s long-held position against crypto ETFs. This is a clear nod towards growing institutional demand for crypto. Among top-caps, Solana is also part of the mix. Vanguard’s move to support a SOL ETF isn’t just bullish for Solana. Instead, it also highlights a broader shift in institutional focus toward altcoins. Until Q4 2025, Ethereum [ETH] was the only altcoin with Spot ETFs in the U.S. However, that’s changing fast. In this context, Vanguard’s adoption of SOL marks a turning point. Even former skeptics are starting to diversify into a market once considered too volatile. Given SOL’s price action, that caution is understandable though. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) Notably, this policy shift comes at a particularly volatile moment too. On the charts, Solana is still one of the “worst-performing assets” across multiple timeframes. In fact, zoomed out, SOL is down about 28% on the year – Marking its worst annual performance since the -95% drop in 2022. The weekly and daily charts tell a similar story. So, what exactly is Vanguard betting on? Looking at the price alone, the ROI isn’t compelling. So, is this move driven more by Solana’s fundamentals than by short-term gains? No doubt, Solana has lived up to its “Ethereum killer” tag. While price action hasn’t always reflected it, the fundamentals tell a different story. Notably, Chainspect data makes that clear, explaining why Vanguard’s bet on SOL matters. According to Chainspect, Solana’s scalability metrics revealed a 4.78% jump in real-time TPS [1H] to 798.5 txs/s and transaction finality at 12.8 seconds. This puts it among the most-efficient high-cap blockchains currently. Source: ChainSpect Against this setup, Vanguard’s bet on Solana clearly looks long-term. As a result, a $500-target (Roughly a 270% rally from SOL’s press time price) can’t be entirely ruled out. The upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, slated for Q1 2026, is expected to give Solana’s fundamentals an additional boost. Combined with growing institutional adoption, these developments will position SOL for potentially substantial upside over the coming year. Especially as improvements in scalability strengthen its long-term fundamentals.

Title: Netflix Deal for Warner Bros. Pushes Global M&A Toward 2021 Peak

(Bloomberg) -- Global mergers and acquisitions are on pace for their best year since 2021, as a spate of late-year deals pushes deal volumes to well over $3 trillion. Netflix Inc.’s $72 billion pact for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the year’s biggest acquisition including debt, underscores how corporate titans are swinging for bold, game-changing M&A under the deal-friendly Trump administration. Dealmakers are betting that they have a once-in-a-generation chance to usher through their dream deals with little or minimal pushback from antitrust regulators. Companies have been able to tap record-breaking financing packages, including Netflix’s loan of $59 billion, which would rank among the biggest of its type. That thinking also helped foster Kimberly-Clark Corp.’s $40 billion deal for Tylenol-maker Kenvue Inc. in November and the BlackRock Inc.-led purchase of Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion in October. Then there’s Union Pacific Corp.’s deal for railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. for more than $80 billion including debt in July, a transaction that would have been unimaginable under the previous administration. As of Thursday, global M&A volumes for the year stood at $3.3 trillion, up 37% from 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts 2025 on track to have the best year for dealmaking since 2021, when there were $3.8 trillion in transactions announced. The increase is even sharper in the US, where deals for companies based in the country are up 53% to almost $1.8 trillion, just short of the 2021 high-water mark, the data show. In addition to 32 deals topping $10 billion this year, the US totals have been driven by almost 300 deals of $1 billion or more. Those included transactions such as Friday’s almost $4.8 billion acquisition of industrial equipment maker SPX Flow Inc. by ITT Inc., which confirmed a Bloomberg News report. The enterprise value of the Netflix deal totals about $82.7 billion. The transaction, which also confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report on the deal being imminent, comes as Wall Street advisers and their clients dash to wrap up deals before the traditional holiday slowdown period.

Title: AIL previews: Big weekend for Ballynahinch in push to keep ground with leaders

Nearing the halfway point and festive mid-season break, the top flight of the Energia All-Ireland League is starting to take shape. The next two rounds could go a long way toward determining whether there will be a breakaway group atop the table. Going into the weekend’s fixtures, Lansdowne had opened up a five-point gap on Ballynahinch in fifth, by dint of last week’s 18-10 win which denied the Ulstermen even a bonus point. Hence, after three fifth-placed finishes in a row, ‘Hinch host leaders St Mary’s acutely mindful of not falling adrift of the leading quartet. The home side retain key men such as Ulster duo Marcus Rea, who shifts to number eight, and outhalf James Humphreys, as well as Conor Rankin and Aaron Sexton. They also appear strengthened by the return of hooker Zack McCall, ex-captain Bradley Lumey and former Irish Under-20 backrower Reuben Crothers. Then again, St Mary’s are flying high and welcome back hugely influential outhalf Conor Dean after he was rested for last week’s big win at home to Nenagh. The meeting of Terenure and Young Munster also looks significant in the playoff picture. Young Munster, who did the double over Terenure last season, sit an unlucky eighth. They have slipped 12 points off their hosts, who are third, after last week’s sixth one-score defeat of the season in their epic derby with Cork Con. Hubert Gilvarry’s hat-trick took his tally to eight tries in seven games, making the Sligo man the division’s leading try scorer. Ger Slattery shifts Munster’s Shay McCarthy to the other wing in a reshuffle and, adding to the attacking talent out wide in this game, Leinster’s Joshua Kenny makes his long-awaited debut for Terenure. Carlos Spencer also promotes Austrian-born outhalf Caspar Gabriel in a reshuffled backline and welcomes back Leinster hooker John McKee after last week’s loss in Clontarf. Cork Con and Old Belvedere renew acquaintances at Temple Hill for the first time in eight years, both sitting mid-table with identical records and both needing a win to stay within sight of the frontrunners. After last week’s big win over UCD, Old Belvedere welcome back Josh Ericson at number eight following his debut for Leinster last week. At the bottom of the table, Nenagh Ormond look to have a daunting task as they continue to search for their first points of the season at home to Clontarf. The champions make their first visit to Tipperary on the back of six successive wins and growing momentum. Nenagh have picked a new backrow and have shuffled their backline, with the 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran starting at outhalf. ‘Tarf are without Jordan Coughlan, but their injuries in midfield are offset by the return of Hugh Cooney, as well as Leinster prop Alex Usanov.

Title: Polymarket plans to use in-house market maker to trade against users: Report

The company has approached traders, including sports bettors, about joining the effort as it expands in the US; rival Kalshi faces scrutiny over similar practices. Polymarket is recruiting staff for an internal market-making team that may trade against users on its platform. The company has recently approached traders — including sports bettors — about joining the group, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the discussions. The initiative comes as Polymarket expands its US presence after resolving regulatory issues stemming from a 2022 case, when it paid a $1.4 million penalty to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi, a Polymarket competitor, already operates an internal unit known as Kalshi Trading, which places bids on its exchange to help support liquidity. The arrangement has drawn criticism from some users, and a proposed class-action lawsuit filed last month alleged that the desk sets betting lines that disadvantage customers. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have also sought external participants to supply liquidity on their platforms. On Kalshi, companies such as Susquehanna International Group have taken on market-making roles. Cointelegraph reached out to Polymarket for comment but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Polymarket is opening US app to waitlisted users after CFTC green light Prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have experienced significant growth in recent years, with both companies securing new partnerships and reaching high private-market valuations as the sector expands. The platforms enable users to bet on a wide range of events, from sports to predicting the next day’s weather in New York City. During The New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Thursday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued that prediction markets’ trading desks could strengthen such markets’ accuracy. “If your goal is for the 99% of the people trying to get a signal about what’s going to happen in the world […] you actually want insider trading,” he said, adding that traders would benefit from “really good information” and “get a higher quality signal out of them.” He added: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who was also part of the discussion, was not so enthusiastic about prediction markets. “We try to help people navigate a 30-year outcome,” Fink said. “I don’t really care about what happens in the next moment. I’m aware in the betting market, in football, you can bet every play, but to me, this is not how I’m going to live my life.” In the third quarter of 2024, prediction markets saw a combined volume on the three largest platforms increase by 565% to $3.1 billion, up from $463.3 million in the prior quarter.

Title: State Street still using DEI to curry favor with leftist state officials — despite Wall Street clampdown
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/business/state-street-still-using-dei-to-curry-favor-with-leftist-state-officials/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T14:50:28Z
Full Content:
Woke investing has faced a clampdown on Wall Street, but if its critics are to be believed State Street – one of the biggest asset managers in the US – is still using it to curry favor with leftist state and local officials who control hundreds of billions of dollars in pension money, The Post has learned. State Street’s work involving controversial Diversity Equity and Inclusion and green energy policies — where it facilitates woke shareholder votes on behalf of some of its big, public pension clients — has sparked chatter on Wall Street and Washington following New York City Comptroller Brad Lander’s move last month to block rival BlackRock as a manager of the city’s pension fund. In a recent posting on X, Alabama GOP senator Tommy Tuberville said State Street, which manages $8 billion in city pension money overseen by Lander, is “already caving to the WOKE Mamdani climate agenda before he has even taken office.” Lander is a key supporter of the socialist New York City mayor elect Zohran Mandani, who himself supports policies such as DEI and green energy. For its part, State Street says it’s getting a bad rap — and it has some strong evidence suggesting as much. The bank offers nearly a dozen such proxy-voting frameworks for pension funds, including those that appeal to Red State public officials that steer clear of anything woke. It doesn’t engage directly with US companies to push stuff like Diversity Equity and Inclusion employment policies or green energy. Rather it facilitates shareholder votes on these measures for progressive pension-fund clients, people like Lander — the fiduciary of the city retirement funds — during what’s known as “proxy season,” when big investors get to vote on corporate governance proposals. Yet the controversy is real. Lander isn’t looking to ditch BlackRock – headed by investing prodigy Larry Fink – because it has done a bad job managing the retirement funds of the city’s firemen, teachers and police. Rather, Lander’s beef is that BlackRock has gone non-woke in recent years. After fully embracing corporate government policies like Environment Social Governance investing, the big asset manager no longer demands strict adherence to so-called carbon-neutral edicts, meaning it won’t force ExxonMobil to invest in windmills versus drilling. It also won’t demand strict gender and racial preferences in appointing board members. State Street, meanwhile, offers something known as the “Sustainability Stewardship Service Proxy Voting and Engagement Policy.” The policy, reviewed by The Post, dictates how the firm will push proxy or shareholder votes on shares it holds for its woke clients on a range of corporate governance edicts, including those, critics say, that are on dubious legal grounds. Those include “progress made against deforestation- and other land use-related targets and commitments” and whether portfolio companies “regularly identify whether there are risks related to human rights in their operations and value chain.” Most controversial, critics say, are the firm’s “Diversity” standards, which hold that “Effective board oversight of a company’s long-term business strategy necessitates gender diversity, and the level of such diversity depends on various factors including culture and progress made.” The standards also require board-level “racial/ethnic diversity in select markets.” State Street’s moves appear to run counter to the recent corporate shift away from DEI. Most large companies, even such diversity stalwarts as JPMorgan and BlackRock, have sought to roll back strict adherence to DEI in hiring and in business dealings – including asset management. Trump later doubled down on ending DEI, issuing an executive order that “directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations.” Press officials from State Street say there is nothing improper about how it handles DEI and other progressive shareholder votes because it’s doing so at the behest of their clients, like Lander, when they demand it. It also facilitates votes for conservative public officials who run pension assets in Middle America and the south. “The sustainability policy that you’re referencing is a policy that our clients can choose or not choose … our voting and engagement policies and practices comply with US law,” wrote spokesman Mark LaVoie. He declined to comment on Tuberville’s social-media commentary. Officials at rival banks suggest otherwise. “What they’re essentially doing is laying such mandates on clients that they are enforcing on their portfolio companies,” said a senior executive at a major money management firm.

One reason is that it is also a federal government contractor, one of the primary targets of Trump’s executive orders ending DEI on both the federal level and in the private sector. It manages a 25% chunk of the so-called “Thrift Savings Plan,” a $1 billion retirement fund for federal government employees. A White House spokesman had no comment on State Street’s DEI activities.

The funeral is taking place in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos Award-winning architect Hugh Wallace has been described as “honest, passionate and deeply human” during his funeral at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin. Mourners were told how the TV star, who died suddenly at home at the age of 68 last Sunday, and his husband, Martin Corbett, were planning to move to a new home this weekend. His funeral service took place this morning at a packed St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin, where he was baptised. Mourners included presenters Dermot Bannon and Brendan Courtney in attendance.

Photo: Sam Boal/Collins Photos Today's News in 90 - Friday December 5 At the beginning of the service, one of Mr Wallace’s favourite songs, Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, was played. The Dean of the cathedral, the Very Reverend William Morton, who led the service, described Mr Wallace as ”honest, direct, passionate, challenging and deeply human” and as a “man who quite literally shaped the spaces in which others live their lives”. “He lived fully. He lived deeply. He left his mark unmistakably,” he told the mourners. “For the last 10 years, since beginning with the series Home of the Year, television viewers were delighted to welcome Hugh into their living rooms. His endearing and gregarious nature, his good humour and optimism, and the fact that he was always so unassuming meant that we all thought he had been on our screens for far longer than he had,” he said. “He was, as we say, a natural with his characteristic voice, his large spectacles, colourful shirts and jumpers. “Hugh, of course, was known to many through his work on television, knowledgeable, forthright, unafraid to speak plainly and never short of conviction, he understood buildings, but more than that, he understood people.” Martin Corbett leaving after the funeral service of Hugh Wallace who passed away unexpectedly at home. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos “A home is where love abides, and everyone who knew Hugh knows that his true home was found in his life with Martin in shared work, shared laughter, shared dreams and shared courage. Their new home held so much in store for them, yet the love that filled those plans does not vanish with death,” Rev Morton added. The dean said he was “fascinated” to hear about the couple’s new house – located just next door to their current home. "Hugh had successfully sought planning permission to have a window put into his bedroom from which he could see the spire of St Patrick's [Cathedral]. "And now, as the spire he saw from his window still stands over the city, so too does the impact of his life stand as it always will in the hearts of those who knew him and who respected him.” During the funeral, friend John Waters paid a tribute to his late friend by making a speech as if Hugh Wallace himself was speaking to mourners. “I’m afraid I was taken by complete surprise on Sunday. I didn't think I'd get a sudden exit. I had assumed a more flamboyant exit in years to come, after much more TV success and perhaps a couple of Bafta Awards, because the rumours were there. “Things were going so well. Douglas Wallace Consultants were flying. My TV career was flying, and furniture was coming for the house that Martin and I had been working on for three years. “With everything that was going on, I'm afraid the universe took its own decision on Sunday night, and here we all are.” Mr Wallace, who was a judge on every RTÉ’s Home of the Year, was born in 1956 and the only child of Susan and Kenneth. TV personality Dermot Bannon leaving after the funeral of Hugh Wallace. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos He met his husband Martin on Valentine’s Day in 1988 at the George bar in Dublin. "Martin has often accused me of having only child syndrome, and I take that as meaning I'm a special person,” Mr Waters continued, speaking on behalf of Mr Wallace. “Some of you may remember the phrase in Dublin that love stories begin at [nightclub] Zhivago. A lot of fairy tales also began at the George pub in Dublin, and Martin and I were part of a fairytale. It was Valentine's night of 1988, and we lasted together for 37 years, which I'd take again if I could. “Martin never really bought into the celebrity stuff. Martin loved me for me; he became my civil partner in 2012, and he stuck with me to the end, right up until Sunday night. “We really did travel the world together and meet very interesting people, but behind the celebrity and the public persona, Martin and I were really two ordinary guys. We had the same hopes, fears, dreams and wants as everyone else. “I'm just going to ask you to remember I've had some of the best times of my life with most of you, or some of you. It's important that when you think of those, you smile, don't be sad. Give Martin a shoulder to lean on if he needs it, be kind to each other." He later quoted William Shakespeare, and said: “Let thee all remember that a pop of colour will brighten your day.” TV presenter Brendan Courtney arrives for the funeral of tv personality and architect Hugh Wallace who passed away unexpectedly at home on the 1st of Dec 2025. The funeral is taking place in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos Mr Wallace always knew he was going to have a career in architecture and design, he said. “I met a kindred spirit, Alan Douglas, and by the end of 1982, in the face of a biting recession, we set up Douglas Wallace architects from our rented flat in Blackrock. So things were starting to move, and we were starting to be known. It was a mad, busy time. There were ups, there were downs, there were tears, there was laughter, there was building of lifetime friendships. “Then came the 90s, and we got bigger contracts, shopping centres, bars, restaurants. We grew, projects got bigger. Our offices got bigger. We had offices in London, Belfast, Prague. We're doing hotels with designers and hotels with visionaries. “Then came 2008, and we all fell over the cliff. They say you can't keep good men down. And from the ashes of Douglas Wallace Mark One came Douglas Wallace Consultants, a new gang of tightly knit directors, of which I am pleased to say I was still part. ”Later on in my career, I got a real lucky break in relation to the TV programmes. It was such a shock to me that that came at that age, but I really embraced it. "As you all know, I loved it, and I'm chuffed to bits with the feedback that I got in terms of the knowledge that I was able to share. I was privileged to do that in the way I did.” The funeral cortege arrives at Dublin's St Patrick's Cathedral. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos
