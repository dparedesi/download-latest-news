Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out giving more money to Argentina, he told reporters on Air Force One on Monday. The president claimed that the country’s midterm election results on Sunday, which went very well for right-wing President Javier Milei, are good for the United States because bonds have gone up, making “a lot of money for the United States.” When a reporter asked if Argentina would need “more support,” referring to the president’s $40 billion bailout of the country, Trump replied in the affirmative. “They might. Yeah, we would consider it,” Trump said. Trump on Argentina: I think we've made a lot of money based on that election because the bonds have gone up… That election made a lot of money for the US… Reporter: Will they need more support or would you consider it?Trump: They might. Yeah, we would consider it. pic.twitter.com/0YMd750W1Y Trump’s comments come as SNAP funding is set to expire in five days thanks to the government shutdown, with millions of Americans expected to lose food stamps across the country. Health care subsidies are also on the verge of expiring in the U.S., causing health insurance premiums to skyrocket for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, the up to $40 billion bailout for Argentina that Trump has already approved benefited major hedge funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, as well as Robert Citrone, a close friend of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who founded the hedge fund Discovery Capital Management. Thus, when Trump brags that Argentina’s right-wing government is making money for the U.S., he’s not referring to the average American struggling to make ends meet, but rather financial executives and hedge funds. But Trump never was too worried about how the average American is doing. Donald Trump is economically punishing Canada (and the American public) for daring to televise Ronald Reagan’s position on tariffs. The president announced Saturday that America’s northern neighbor would literally pay for Ontario’s decision to air portions of one of Reagan’s 1987 radio addresses, in which the conservative icon argued that tariffs undermine economic prosperity and only serve to “hurt every American.” The 35 percent tariff on Canadian goods would increase by at least 10 percent, Trump said. The advert really irked Trump, who claimed that the very real speech was a “fake.” Trump also cited the advertisement as his reason for canceling trade talks with Canada and then deciding to actually impose more levies on America’s Hat as recompense for the stunt. “Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement on Ronald Reagan’s Speech on Tariffs,” Trump posted to Truth Social. “The Reagan Foundation said that they, ‘created an ad campaign using selective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan. The ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address,’ and ‘did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.’ “The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canada’s hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their ‘rescue’ on Tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States. Now the United States is able to defend itself against high and overbearing Canadian Tariffs (and those from the rest of the World as well!).” While the ad stitched together some of Reagan’s quotes from different parts of the speech, none of the soundbites used in the ad were made up. In fact, the speech in its entirety reveals Reagan was much harsher on tariffs than the ad made him out to be. The ad was developed by Ontario’s provincial government. The goal of the ad, per Ontario Premier Doug Ford, was to reach as many Americans as possible. After a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ford announced the decision to pull the ad, which will officially stop airing on Monday. But ultimately, Trump doesn’t appear able to grapple with the reality that his Republican hero considered his favorite economic stratagem a total dud. “Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy, but Canada said he didn’t!” Trump continued in his post. “Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 percent over and above what they are paying now.” Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump said he had no interest in meeting with Carney to resolve the matter, further elaborating that he wouldn’t be meeting with Carney “for a while.” President Trump on Monday bragged about passing a dementia test, while challenging Democrats decades younger than him to try and do the same. “[We] have a great group of people, which they don’t,” Trump said while taking questions inside Air Force One. “They have Jasmine Crocket, a low-IQ person. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] is low IQ.… Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed. Those are really hard, they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way. But they’re cognitive tests.” The “cognitive tests” that Trump is bragging about so proudly—and condescendingly telling two outspoken, progressive women of color to take—is most likely some variation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The MoCA is a 10-minute assessment designed to identify signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s, and yet Trump talks about it like it was the Graduate Record Examinations or the LSAT. Trump visited Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, raising questions about whether he once again took the dementia test on this visit. The president has been bragging about this test for years now. “It was 30 to 35 questions.… The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It’s, like, you’ll go: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. So they say, ‘Could you repeat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. It’s: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV,’” Trump said back in 2020. “They said nobody gets it in order.… It’s actually not that easy, but for me, it was easy.” “I think it was 35, 30 questions,” he said again last year. “They always show you the first one, like a giraffe, a tiger, or this, or that—a whale. ‘Which one is the whale?’ OK. And that goes on for three or four [questions], and then it gets harder and harder and harder.” The test itself is controversial within the medical community, and Trump’s misrepresentation of it has been thoroughly debunked over the years. “It’s a very, very low bar for somebody who carries the nuclear launch codes in their pocket to pass and certainly nothing to brag about,” Jonathan Reiner, a George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences professor and cardiologist, told The Washington Post last year. And yet Trump, in the midst of a government shutdown, continues to place the MoCA on a pedestal, using it to disparage Representatives Crockett and Ocasio-Cortez even though they could likely pass it with flying colors. Especially if it just consists of “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” President Donald Trump’s administration claims that its hands are tied against funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program while the government is closed, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s own shutdown plan says that’s not the case. The USDA published a memo in August claiming that SNAP contingency funds could not legally be used to cover regular benefits for the 42 million Americans that use them, and that any states trying to cover the cost would not be reimbursed, Axios reported Monday. “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover benefits,” the memo stated. “The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists.” Now the funds could solely be used for so-called contingencies, such as natural disasters, USDA claimed. “For example, Hurricane Melissa is currently swirling in the Caribbean and could reach Florida,” the memo stated. “Having funds readily available allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to mobilize quickly in the days and weeks following a disaster.” But the USDA’s Lapse of Funding Plan, published a month later and which Axios reported has been removed from the agency’s website, stated just the opposite. “OMB’s General Counsel provided a letter to USDA on May 23, 2025 stating that there is a bona fide need to obligate benefits for October—the first month of the fiscal year—during or prior to the month of September, thereby guaranteeing that benefit funds are available for program operations even in the event of a government shutdown at the beginning of a fiscal year,” the disappeared document states. “In addition, Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds that can be used for State Administrative Expenses to ensure that the State can also continue operations during a Federal Government shutdown,” the plan stated. “These multi-year contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.” The memo also claimed that using the contingency funds would prevent additional transfers to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, which has reportedly been funded using Trump’s tariff money during the shutdown. This latest memo from the USDA is part of a wider campaign from the Trump administration to hold the health and well-being of millions of Americans hostage, while suggesting it is the Democrats who are responsible. In fact, the USDA website currently has a banner at the top explicitly blaming Democrats for the shutdown. But in reality, it is the White House that is picking and choosing which projects to fund and what to withhold to make Americans hurt—so it can pressure Democrats into signing a clean continuing resolution. Earlier this month, the USDA sent a letter to states warning that a lapse in appropriations had resulted in “insufficient funds” to pay SNAP benefits through November. Last week, states began to issue warnings to their most vulnerable residents that benefits would be suspended starting in the middle of October. President Trump is doing absolutely nothing to dispel the growing rumor that he will completely disregard the Constitution to run for an illegal third presidential term. “Steve Bannon said in a recent interview that there would be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term in 2028,” a reporter asked Trump on Air Force One on Monday. “Is that something you’d be willing to challenge in court?” “Well, I haven’t really thought about it, we have some very good people as you know,” he replied. “But uh, I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” After saying Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio could run for president in 2028, Trump again brought it back to himself. “I would love to do it,” he emphasized. Asked by a reporter if he wasn’t ruling out a third term, Trump replied, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.” Reporter: Bannon said there could be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term Is that something you'd be willing to challenge at the court to be able to do?Trump: I haven't really thought about it. We have some very good people as you know.. but I have… pic.twitter.com/gNnSAYsOoi The president is wrong about the poll numbers, as they are currently some of the lowest he’s experienced. And more importantly, the president has absolutely thought about 2028—he’s already had the hats made. Steve Bannon, his former right hand, has made the actual plans abundantly clear. “Trump is gonna be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said in an interview with The Economist published last Thursday. “There’s many different alternatives. At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan and President Trump will be the president in ’28.” Trump’s complete nonanswer, combined with everything Bannon and the deep MAGA base has said about it, should raise alarm for anyone still holding onto whatever constitutional values still apply in this country. The most corrupt president in modern history is planning a constitutional coup, and it’s highly unlikely that he’ll let tradition and custom—things he’s never cared about—stop him. The head of CNN reportedly wants his network to tone down its coverage of President Trump destroying the White House’s East Wing as he builds his enormous ballroom. Status reports that CNN CEO Mark Thompson told his staffers on a conference call Thursday to reduce the network’s coverage of the White House’s destruction, one day after he had paid a visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Wednesday meeting at the White House was supposedly about CNN’s upcoming streaming product and an opportunity for Trump administration officials to appear on the network, but Thompson’s words to CNN employees raise the question of whether Trump officials told him to alter the network’s coverage. Staffers at the network are suspicious, according to Status, especially considering that CNN anchor Jake Tapper has been trying to get an interview with the president. CNN has denied the report. “This is reckless and irresponsible conjecture without any fact checking done prior to publication,” a spokesperson said in a statement to The New Republic. The network has a historically bad relationship with Trump, with its correspondents often butting heads with the president going back to before his first term, and its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is up for sale with Trump ally David Ellison among the leading suitors. During his second term as president, Trump has made no secret of his grudges against media outlets, seeking to punish them through the FCC and defamation lawsuits. Despite Thompson’s reported words during the editorial call, the outlet has still covered the destruction of the East Wing since Thursday. Could Trump be trying to take advantage of CNN and engineer softer coverage? Is Thompson trying to save his own job in the event Ellison acquires CNN? Either way, it’s another example of the Trump administration infringing on the freedom of the press. This story has been updated. Senator Rand Paul is on a campaign to knock President Donald Trump off of his warpath. During Paul’s appearance on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked the Kentucky Republican what information he wanted the government to provide about its military strikes in the Caribbean Sea. But Paul said that a briefing wasn’t what he was after. “A briefing’s not enough to overcome the Constitution,” Paul said. “The Constitution says that when you go to war, Congress has to vote on it. And during a war then, [there are] lower rules for engagement and people do sometimes get killed without due process. “But the drug war, or the crime war, has typically been something we do through law enforcement. And so far they have alleged that these people are drug dealers. No one said their name, no one said their evidence,” Paul said. “So, at this point, I would call them extrajudicial killings. “This is akin to what China does, to [what] Iran does with drug dealers; they summarily execute people without providing evidence to the public, so it’s wrong,” Paul said. Both Iran and China have been known to secretly execute drug dealers, without providing due process. Paul, a Libertarian, has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s policy on the strikes, pointing to the military’s likely illegal drones, as well as the statistical likelihood that some of its targets are mistaken. The U.S. conducted its tenth strike on a foreign vessel on Friday, killing another six people without providing any actual evidence linking the boats to any drug cartel. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the ship was operated by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. Trump also ordered an aircraft carrier strike group to the Caribbean, in a major escalation of military tension between the U.S. and Venezuela. Last week, Trump stated his intention to expand his lawless strikes to dry land—bragging that Congress wouldn’t stop him. Donald Trump’s latest doctor visit turned out to be a fairly serious medical evaluation. The president stopped by Walter Reed Medical Center earlier this month, but the president’s team refused for days to explain why. Apparently it was for MRI scans, a medical tool typically used to assess tumors, joint injuries, or heart conditions. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Monday, Trump claimed the visit was little more than a “routine yearly checkup”—despite the fact that he had his annual physical just six months ago. “I got an MRI,” he said before touching down in Japan. “It was perfect.” The president did not elaborate on what the doctors were looking for or what they had found, though the 79-year-old did emphasize that the doctors allegedly told him he had “some of the best reports” they had ever seen. “You can ask the doctors,” he said. “Nobody has ever given you reports like I give you.” Trump then went on to brag about his IQ, claiming that “aptitude tests” he received at Walter Reed proved he was superior to his political opponents—especially compared to a couple of healthy young women. “You give her an IQ test. Have her pass, like, the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed,” Trump said referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “I took—those are very hard—they’re really aptitude tests, I guess, in a certain way.” Trump also derided Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, suggesting that she too should grapple with the “very hard” tests, which he said included questions about “tigers, an elephant, a giraffe.” It’s unclear what test this could be referring to, but it sounds remarkably similar to Trump’s infamous “person, woman, man, camera, TV” test—which health experts have revealed is a test to check for signs of dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other cognitive issues. The White House said that the president was in “excellent overall health” after his October 10 visit, referring to the testing as “advanced imaging.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to clarify that language during a White House press briefing last week, rejecting a reporter’s query as to whether that meant Trump had received MRI scans. “Advanced imaging is something that presidents receive and people receive when they go to the doctor, and so we provided a detailed readout of that physical, and I would encourage you back for that,” she said. When pressed again on the matter, Leavitt said: “I don’t know the exact imaging that took place, but as the physician’s note said, the president is in incredibly good shape and I think that’s evidenced here every single day.” Trump’s health has been a topic of concern since he was on the campaign trail, when reports circulated that he couldn’t remember the contents of the cognitive exams he claimed to ace. Since then, the president has been spotted with odd discolorations on his hand, routinely appears discombobulated and lethargic during critical meetings with world leaders, and had a drooping expression during 9/11 ceremonies in September that onlookers suggested could be a sign of a stroke. It looks like President Donald Trump’s family is once again using the White House as a personal piggy bank. A Florida-based drone manufacturer linked to Don Trump Jr. just received its largest ever contract to supply parts to the Pentagon, the Financial Times reported Friday. Unusual Machines, a company that builds and sells drones, said that the U.S. Army had contracted it to make 3,500 drone motors, among other parts, and the Pentagon indicated that it would order an additional 20,000 components in 2026. CEO Allen Evans said that he believed it was the largest order the company had ever received from the U.S. government, but he did not disclose the value of the contract. The Defense Department appears to have stopped posting daily contract notices since the government shutdown began on October 1. Trump Jr. joined the company’s advisory board in November 2024, shortly after his father became commander in chief of the U.S. military. Trump Jr. previously disclosed that he owned a roughly $4 million stake in the company, although it’s unclear whether he has retained his shares. Earlier this month, Evans told Bloomberg that the president’s son had continued to participate in fundraising rounds. There are obvious conflicts of interest that surround the president’s son being positioned to profit off the defense industry—and the Trump administration has already done plenty to pave the way for buying more American-made drones. In June, Trump signed an executive order to “unleash American drone dominance,” and in July, the Pentagon removed restrictions in order to accelerate drone procurement. Trump Jr.’s involvement immediately boosted Unusual Machines’ beleaguered stock, and Evans said that the first son’s public endorsement made it easier to get meetings with potential partners, allowing the company to raise more than $80 million from investors this year. But Evans insisted that Trump Jr. wasn’t involved in the massive deal, and a spokesperson for Trump Jr. said that “Don has never communicated with anyone in the administration on behalf of Unusual Machines or about the contract in question.” The president’s family has pocketed more than $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since Trump’s return to the White House, according to the Center for American Progress. That figure includes more than $1.2 billion from their cryptocurrency side hustle. On Thursday, Trump pardoned the founder of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, who helped launch his family’s cryptocurrency platform, World Liberty Financial, with a massive $2 billion favor for its stablecoin. The ballroom replacing the White House East Wing will share Donald Trump’s name. The $300 million project has yet to receive a formal designation, but it is already being referred to as the “President Donald J. Trump Ballroom,” a moniker that will likely stick, senior administration officials told ABC News Friday. Practically every detail that has emerged about the ballroom—and the East Wing’s complete destruction this week—has been uncovered by media outlets that refused to take the administration’s plan at face value. After promising Americans in July that his ballroom proposal would “be near but not touching” the historic building, Trump plowed ahead without prerequisite approval from the National Capital Planning Commission (which has been closed since the government shutdown began earlier this month) and without the express permission of Congress. The project’s price tag also inexplicably grew by 50 percent over the last week. What Trump had pitched as a $200 million project was instead referred to this week as a $300 million development plan that the White House suggested would be funded, in part, by some of the country’s wealthiest families and biggest corporations, including the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. Government officials are still trying to ascertain whether Trump’s sudden, unauthorized decision to demolish the White House was legal, but at least two Americans have already opted to sue him over it in an attempt to suspend the construction. The White House’s partial destruction is, ultimately, another illustration that the country’s constitutional system of checks and balances has eroded. The international real estate mogul’s desire to destroy the government—and with it, the architectural face of American democracy—has received practically zero pushback from his allies in Congress, who appear all too willing to sit back as Trump courts billionaires to fund his golden banquet hall. Resisting Trump’s drafts for the East Wing would require someone in power to actually hold the president accountable. But his desire to destroy and redevelop the White House as he sees fit should come as no surprise, since he’s never appeared to be a fan of the national symbol. During his first term, Trump reportedly called the White House “a dump” (an allegation that he has publicly refuted), and he has spent no small part of his second term living and dining at his own properties rather than the executive mansion.

Dublin pub group Grand Slam Bars saw pretax profits nearly double to €983,000, as revenues grew following the group’s midyear acquisition of McSorley’s in Ranelagh. In newly filed financial accounts, the group said its performance “has continued to improve year on year” noting that turnover has increased from €9.4 million to €11.3 million. The bar group is owned by Noel Anderson, the former chairman of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), along with four former Irish international rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, and the Kearney brothers Rob and Dave. Grand Slam Bars owns the Bridge bar in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock in the south Dublin suburb of the same name and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon in the city centre. During the financial year, it bought McSorley’s pub in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, for €5.5 million. The majority of the group’s turnover – €7.3 million, or around two-thirds of revenue – was generated from the sale of alcoholic drinks. This represented a significant increase on drinks sales in the previous year at €5.75 million. Food sales also increased, up marginally to €3.8 million, alongside tea and coffee sales which rose from €44,000 to €133,000. The group saw pretax profits increase by 90 per cent from €518,000 in the financial year ending in February 2024 to just over €983,000 this past year. The group’s assets have risen to €14.6 million from just over €8 million in 2024. Buoyed by the acquisition of McSorley’s pub, the company had an average of 153 employees, an increase of 16 jobs on the previous year. Staff costs also rose to just over €4.1 million from nearly €3.8 million. Borrowings at the firm are up from €2.1 million in 2024 to €7.28 million with a mortgage, which is secured against the group’s pubs, having been added to the company. The former international rugby player investors in the group serve as directors on its subsidiary firms and directors “ambassador fees” during the year came to €55,000. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager, which owed the group early €150,000 at year end.

Title: Standard Chartered Says This Could Be the Week Everything Changes for Bitcoin | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because this week could quietly redefine the tone of the entire market. Between shifting US-China trade winds, a looming Fed decision, and Bitcoin’s tightening grip above six figures, the mood feels different — almost expectant. This could be one of those weeks where the market quietly shifts from uncertainty to conviction. According to Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoff Kendrick, a wave of surprisingly positive US-China developments has turned market sentiment “from fear into hope.” Kendrick highlighted that US Treasury Secretary Bessent signaled an imminent breakthrough over the weekend. He indicated that China is expected to suspend rare earth export controls for a year and increase soybean purchases from the US in exchange for Washington dropping its threatened 100% tariffs. Details of this potential deal will be finalized after the Trump-Xi meeting in Korea later this week. The news has already rippled through the markets, with Bitcoin benefiting from the positive sentiment. In the same tone, the USD-CNH pair has fallen to near year-to-date lows, signaling a stronger yuan and renewed confidence in global trade stability. This easing tension has, in turn, fueled a rebound in Bitcoin’s correlation to risk appetite, as investors rotate away from defensive positions. “The Bitcoin-gold ratio, highlighted last week, continues to push higher,” Kendrick wrote, noting that it now sits just above levels seen before the tariff scare earlier this month. “I’ll watch for this ratio to break back above 30 to signal an end to such fear.” For Kendrick, the coming days may mark a critical turning point for Bitcoin and how investors interpret its long-term cycle. He pointed out that over $2 billion exited US gold ETFs last week, suggesting an appetite shift that could soon favor Bitcoin. “It would confirm a more positive backdrop if even half of that re-entered Bitcoin ETFs early this week,” he noted. The broader setup looks equally intriguing. Wednesday’s FOMC meeting is expected to deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut, despite the Fed operating in what Kendrick described as a “data blackout.” It's FOMC week!There's a 96.7% chance the Fed will cut interest rates by 25bps. What’s your prediction? pic.twitter.com/SRVPczDYcL He also hinted that growing speculation over the next Fed Chair could prove “Bitcoin positive” if it raises concerns about central bank independence. Add to that, the looming earnings releases from five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ — Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, and Amazon — and the macro calendar looks loaded with catalysts. “This week is about to be pure chaos…the government shutdown is about to hit day 30. The Fed decides rates on Wednesday. Powell speaks right after, during a data blackout. Then, we’ve got Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, and Amazon, all reporting earnings. That’s $15.2 trillion in market cap dropping numbers in the same week. And just when you think it’s over… Trump meets President Xi on Thursday, 48 hours before his 100% tariff deadline. Buckle up. This week could move everything,” Mario Nawfal corroborated. Kendrick argues that a fresh Bitcoin all-time high would serve as the “death knell” for those still clinging to the halving cycle as the primary driver of BTC’s value. “ETF flows matter more now…If this week goes well, Bitcoin may never go below $100,000 again,” he said. This statement echoes remarks highlighted in a recent US Crypto News publication. Whether or not that prediction holds, this week’s mix of diplomacy, data, and digital gold could prove decisive for the next phase of Bitcoin’s story.

Title: Saudi Power Broker Pitches Kingdoms AI Pivot to Wall Street

Time Published: 2025-10-27T10:32:59Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s annual investment showpiece kicks off this week against a steady drumbeat of headlines on the kingdom’s strained finances: The deficit has grown as oil prices persist below levels needed to balance the budget, forcing spending to be reprioritized and parts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s trillion-dollar ambitions to be scaled back. At the center of it all will be Richard Attias, who has spent the past decade courting investors to back the kingdom’s economic transformation. The Moroccan-born power broker is ensconced at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s global outreach, often pictured with Prince Mohammed, Yasir Al Rumayyan, who runs the $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, and even US President Donald Trump. “The show must go on,” he said on the sidelines of last year’s Future Investment Initiative that opened under the shadow of war. Tensions shrouding the region may have ebbed, but this year’s event presents challenges of its own — mainly the kingdom’s pivot from being an exporter of capital to a seeker of foreign cash. In an interview in Riyadh, Attias credited the FII with playing a crucial role in driving investment, generating as much as $190 billion in deals since its 2017 launch. He characterized the kingdom’s growing emphasis on domestic investment as “extremely fair” and said financiers’ interest in the country remains strong. “We didn’t create FII for people to come, take the money and run,” Attias said. “We created FII for people to understand where the money should go.” Wall Street is paying close attention. This year’s forum will lean more heavily into technology and artificial intelligence, two industries central to the crown prince’s diversification plan. It will feature marquee names, including Blackstone Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink, who are both vying to invest billions of dollars with Saudi Arabia’s new AI firm, Humain. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon and others will be eying opportunities in the kingdom’s emerging private credit market. The Davos Rival About a decade ago, officials in Riyadh wanted an event to rival Davos as part of efforts to lure foreign investors into an economy long fueled by oil. They turned to Attias, a former World Economic Forum insider, who helped the kingdom set up FII. At its inaugural 2017 edition, MBS — newly elevated as crown prince — laid out his vision for Neom, a planned $500 billion city on the Red Sea that signaled the kingdom’s outsize ambitions. Eight years later, Neom’s costs have ballooned to an estimated $1.5 trillion, and progress has slowed. The ninth edition of the FII comes amid growing scrutiny of those projects and renewed doubts over whether Saudi Arabia can sustain its breakneck development agenda. Even the local stock market — once a regional bright spot — has struggled, with recent listings underwhelming. For Attias, whose eponymous firm counts the kingdom and FII as key clients, the stakes are uniquely personal. Richard Attias & Associates produces dozens of events worldwide in addition to the Saudi confab, and is now preparing for a listing that could earn its founder millions. But those fortunes are tied to the success of the Saudi story Attias helped craft. Get the Mideast Money newsletter , a weekly look at the intersection of wealth and power in the region. The event typically attracts thousands of people each year. Since 2023, attendance requires a $15,000 annual membership with the FII Institute, a nonprofit that manages the Riyadh-based conference and the wider brand. Attias describes the fee as “modest” compared with global peers such as Davos or the Milken Institute Global Conference, where tickets start at around $25,000. Although often dubbed “Davos in the Desert,” Attias rejects the comparison. “Number one, we’re not in Davos, and number two, we’re not in the desert,” he said. “Riyadh today is one of the most developed cities in the world.” In any case, FII has now become an integral part of the kingdom’s broader investment strategy and is expanding its global reach. Attias is helping set up a satellite edition of the conference in Tokyo, on the back of a turn in Miami that marked one of Trump’s first public appearances after being sworn in for a second term. Saudi Arabia’s success snagging Trump to headline the gathering spotlighted the close relationship between the two sides and their growing financial ties. The crown prince is set to meet Trump in the White House in November, in his first visit to the US since 2018. This year’s line-up features dignitaries from about 20 countries ranging from China’s vice president to the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, showing how the kingdom balances competing global interests. Gulf governments are “quite adept at working both ends of the political economy spectrum to advance their interests on the global stage,” said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. The event also places Attias at the highest echelons of power in Saudi Arabia. He says he communicates with world leaders via WhatsApp, and that Crown Prince Mohammed “trusts totally what FII is doing.” For all its successes, the FII has faced its share of crises. The 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi caused top business leaders, including Bill Gates, Jamie Dimon and Richard Branson to distance themselves from the event, citing human rights concerns. Attias said that year’s edition still drew more delegates than before, buoyed by participants from Russia, China, the Middle East and Africa. By 2019, most who had shunned the event had returned, lured by the promise of mega-deals tied to the Vision 2030 economic transformation agenda. Many, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., have since deepened ties to the kingdom. The bank underwrote a $20 billion debt facility to help investors including the PIF take Electronic Arts Inc. private in a $55 billion deal last month, and secured a regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia days before FII. Chief Executive Dimon is scheduled to speak at this year’s event. Global Player Financier Ken Moelis was among dealmakers who stuck it out in 2018. His firm landed major mandates, including Aramco’s record $29 billion IPO, earning him the nickname “Ken of Arabia.” Moelis & Co. is now advising Attias’s firm on its planned listing, expected to involve about 30% of the company’s shares. Both Attias and Sanabil, an investment arm of the PIF, are considering selling part of their stakes. Attias said he expects Sanabil to “make good money” from the offering but insists the goal is to institutionalize the business rather than cash out. He also hinted at the possibility of a future secondary listing. “We have offices in Dubai, Riyadh, New York, Paris and Africa,” he said. “So we’re a global player.” RA&A has evolved beyond producing the FII, which now accounts for only about 10% of its revenue, and organizes more than 50 conferences a year. Ahmad Al-Husseini serves as CEO, though Attias’s personal imprint remains. His wife Cecilia — previously married to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy — and daughter both work at the firm. At the FII Institute, Attias took over as acting CEO after Penny Richards, formerly of the Aspen Institute, resigned just months into the job. A permanent successor is expected by year-end. “It’s not easy to follow the traces of someone who has a very strong fingerprint,” Attias said, acknowledging that his deep involvement makes succession harder. The intensifying competition for events across the Gulf presents another challenge. Dubai plans to launch Future Finance Week with the Institute of International Finance in May 2026. The regional circuit already includes Abu Dhabi Finance Week in December and Doha’s Qatar Economic Forum, a pre-summer fixture. While these events will mean more opportunities for firms that help organize them, it will also mean more competition for existing conferences, including FII. Attias, though, remains confident FII has carved out its own space. “I am told by many people, ‘Richard, give me the dates of FII for the next three to four years,’” he said. The government of the State of Qatar is the underwriter of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: The worst bull run ever? How institutions, memes, and macro turned crypto’s glory cycle into a grind

One frustrated altcoin trader says the quiet part out loud: this isn’t the euphoric bull cycle crypto hoped for; it’s a stripped-down reality check. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For a market supposedly in a bull run, it doesn’t feel like one. Sure, Bitcoin may have set a couple of record highs this cycle, but the rallies have been uneventfully yawn-inducing, and the corrections have been savage. Altcoins are down 90% or more. Retail has vanished. And even the diehards are wondering if this so-called bull cycle deserves the name at all. This is, by many accounts, the hardest bull market crypto has ever seen. Bitcoin has doubled since its 2023 lows, but the soul of the market feels hollowed out. What happened? Altcoin trader “Crypto Birb” breaks it down into three main reasons. Wall Street didn’t just arrive this cycle; it moved in and redecorated. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman didn’t come to speculate; they came to own infrastructure, custody networks, and tokenized real-world assets. Institutional adoption is the tidy headline, but what it really means is extraction at scale. They’re not playing memecoins or hunting airdrops. They bought the pipes, liquidity rails, and compliance corridors that everyone else has to rent. As Telcoin Magazine and Fortune both note, institutional adoption in early 2025 was “foundational, not speculative.” That’s great for Bitcoin, terrible for the culture. As Crypto Birb comments: “Smart money took what’s valuable – good on them.” If the institutions professionalized the space, memecoins disfigured it. What began as satire became the dominant narrative of 2024 and 2025. Every week brought a new “community” token, a new animal, a new political in-joke, and a new wave of burned holders. Memecoins turned crypto into a casino with no exit doors. Token after token pumped on virality alone, then cratered. Even industry veterans who should’ve known better got caught chasing hype over substance. It was the perfect storm of self-sabotage: retail greed met web3 irony, and both got wrecked. Even the macro backdrop worked against risk. President Trump’s trade wars and tariffs, praised by some for protectionism, triggered a 20% drawdown in equities and sapped liquidity. Combined with persistently high interest rates, capital became expensive, speculative flows dried up, and risk assets like crypto flatlined.​ Ironically, the “pro‑crypto administration” ended up freezing the retail comeback. With rates high, consumer spending slowed, and the average investor’s appetite for 100x tokens evaporated. What should’ve been the era of abundance turned into a patience test. And yet, amid all the wreckage, Bitcoin persists, slow, steady, and sovereign. Institutional capital has cemented its legitimacy while everything else burns. As a16z’s State of Crypto report shows, Bitcoin’s strength is underwritten by macro forces and regulatory acceptance.​ This is what maturity looks like: less euphoria, fewer parabolic charts, and a market that’s finally behaving like a financial system rather than a playground. But for those who came here for “number go up,” it feels like a punishment. This bull cycle isn’t exciting; it’s exhausting. Bitcoin’s resilience proves crypto can endure. But the rest of the market, its creativity, its retail energy, and its wild optimism were collateral damage. Maybe that’s the price of progress. Or maybe it’s a sign that somewhere along the way, we lost the script, chasing the meme at the expense of the mission. As Crypto Birb states: “We got played. BY OURSELVES. This is our punishment for choosing hype over utility.” Either way, this bull run will go down in history not for its gains, but for its lesson: not all cycles are meant to make you rich.

October 26, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 26th issue of our Weekly Report. First, let’s go over the key progress made in the EAI Flywheel. On S1 User Ecosystem: Faraday Finance Inc. was officially established and has submitted its auto finance license application to the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The company aims to promote new vehicle sales by soon offering customized finance solutions for FF and FX users — including vehicle financing and leasing services. Through flexible and customer-centric payment options, Faraday Finance could enhance vehicle affordability, improve purchase conversion, and drive substantial sales growth. This is an important step for potentially boosting sales and delivery of models including the FX Super One. In the U.S., most customers either buy cars with a loan or choose to lease them. The progress of our finance company would give our future users more choices and help FF and FX attract new buyers faster. The company could also help manage financial assets and cash flow more efficiently.It will lay the foundation for a fully integrated and dedicated finance ecosystem that supports users through their entire ownership journey. Last weekend, we participated in ComplexCon, one of the world’s most influential pop-culture events, held at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The event brought together hundreds of top streetwear and pop-culture brands and over 50,000 attendees. Both the FF 91 2.0 and FX Super One became spotlight products at the show, attracting significant attention from visitors. On S2-S4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production, and Delivery: As mentioned earlier, the first batch of full-set parts procurement agreement for FX Super One has been signed. This week, key team leaders traveled to the Hanford factory to review preparations for the first vehicle off-line milestone. The whole team is now in full sprint mode for the year-end off-line target for our first FX Super One vehicle. This marks a key milestone for FX, from R&D and design to prototype development, pilot validation, and eventually the potential for mass production, subject to securing necessary agreements, funding and permitting. The entire company — especially the factory team — is now fully mobilized and making thorough preparations to achieve this milestone, which holds great significance not only for the FX brand, but also for the entire company. Moving on to S5 Capital Markets and Finance: The biggest highlight this week is that BlackRock—one of the world’s largest asset managers—increased its holdings in FFAI once again. According to its latest 13G filing with the SEC, as of September 30, 2025, BlackRock owned about 6.8 million FFAI common shares, up from 5.38 million shares at the end of last quarter—an increase of roughly 1.41 million shares, or 26%. Let’s take a look at S6, Middle East progress: We’re now just two days away from the FX Super One Grand Launch in Dubai, which will take place on October 28 at the Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa. We invite everyone to join the live stream and witness this milestone together. I’m also thrilled to share that we have officially signed one of the greatest sports legends of all time — a true GOAT — who will become the first global owner and Co-Creation Officer of the FX Super One. This exciting partnership will be officially unveiled at the Middle East Final Launch this coming week. On Crypto Flywheel: The Crypto Flywheel also saw solid progress this week. QLGN announced a strategic partnership with BitGo and kicked off its first batch of C10 Treasury allocations. The next day, daily trading volume surged to nearly $300 million. Looking ahead to next week’s plan: After the FX Super One Middle East Final Launch, we’ll share more updates on our Middle East operations, first vehicle off-line progress, and details of our partnership with our first global GOAT owner.We’re now entering one of the most important growth phases in our company’s history—and we’re confident in delivering on our commitments to our stockholders, investors, partners, and users. See you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: St Finbarr's pip Nemo in Cork nailbiter

RTÉ Sport contributor St Finbarr's 1-14 Nemo Rangers 1-13 St Finbarr’s are the Cork Premier Senior Football Champions for 2025 following a nail biting 1-14 to 1-13 victory over their great rivals Nemo Rangers at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. Steven Sherlock kicked 0-05 and dual star Brian Hayes was named Player of the Match after tallying 1-02 as the Andy Scannell Cup was draped in blue and yellow ribbons for the first time since 2021. This is the club’s 11th victory overall in the competition and perhaps the sweetest of the lot as it is the first time that St Finbarr’s have beaten Nemo Rangers in the decider, with this being the fifth meeting in the final between the two clubs. The result also marks just the second time in 36 years that the blue and yellow has triumphed over the green and black at senior level. Nemo Rangers had their own demons, as Robbie Dwyer’s side were out to avoid losing three consecutive county finals following successive defeats to Castlehaven. The Barr’s edged it in the second half, despite trailing 1-09 to 0-10 at the break with Kevin O’Donovan’s goal in the 21st minute ultimately the difference after a period of play that saw the two clubs level four times. Things exploded after the restart as Sherlock converted a free and Brian Hayes rifled the roof of the net in the 32nd minute to make the scoreboard read 1-12 to 1-09. Two quick goal chances then fell to both clubs, and good goalkeeping by Darragh Newman and Micheál Aodh Martin increased the tension around the ground as the clocked ticked on. Sherlock followed that up with a point from play, and Mark Cronin immediately replied for Nemo Rangers at the Blackrock End. The corner forward had and opportunity to reduce the arrears down to one with his next touch, but the free for a two pointer hit the post in the 47th minute. Cronin did not miss with his next placed ball, this time from inside the arc, and it was 1-13 to 1-11 with just under five minutes left to play. Both clubs went to their bench in search of something, as the nervous feeling inside the ground seemed to reach new levels. Paul Kerrigan was one of those brought on by Nemo, with the 2010 All Ireland winner entering the pitch seeking his 11th county title. Conor Horgan was the one to equalise with an orange flag, just as the clock turned red, and a grandstand finish was set up. A substitute did decide the destination of the Andy Scannell Cup, and it was Cillian Myers Murray who curled the ball over in the second minute of time added on. Nemo poured forward in search of an equalising or match winning score, but they could not get through the blue wall.

Title: Germany is doing to itself what even its defeat in WWII couldn’t

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory Toward the end of World War II in Europe, the US government pondered a plan to not only demilitarize but also disintegrate and deindustrialize postwar Germany. Named after its main proponent, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, the Morgenthau Plan proceeded from the insane assumption that “it is a fallacy that Europe needs a strong industrial Germany.” If it had been implemented, the remains of defeated Germany would have been deliberately turned into a post-industrial wasteland. But then the Cold War happened, everyone, East and West, wanted their Germans making modern things in factories again, and so it was Marshall Plan in and Morgenthau Plan out. Lucky Germans. Now the US-Soviet Cold War has been over for a third of a century already. You’d think that for the Germans – finally free of the odd obligation to kill each other on behalf of Washington and Moscow in case of World War Three and (sort of) happily re-united – Morgenthau’s dark fantasies would just be a tale of bad times long gone-by. But there you would underestimate the often badly overlooked German gift for eccentricity. In reality, post-Cold War Germany’s governments have set out on a resolute course of self-Morgenthauing economic auto-asphyxiation, adapting and obstinately clinging to policies that look as if they had been deliberately devised to deindustrialize and wreck their own country. How can this be? For starters consider the case of global chemistry giant BASF: “What’s happening to Germany you’ll see first at BASF,” some say. And they have a point. Until recently, the German-headquartered company was considered the “crown jewel” of the country’s industry. Now, Germany is “mired in its longest period of stagnation since the Second World War” – says not Moscow’s RT but London’s FT – and BASF exemplifies much of what went so very, very badly wrong. Like much of German business in general, the country’s traditionally powerful and vital chemical industry “is stuck in the greatest crisis” since, at least, the early 1990s. Since 2019, German industry as a whole has shed a total of almost a quarter-million jobs. Regarding BASF – originally founded in 1865 smack in the middle of modern Germany’s Time of Founders (“Gründerzeit”) as the “Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik” – it is true that it is still the largest chemical industry company in the world with subsidiaries in over 80 countries and 112,000 employees. But in Germany, at its original production site in the city of Ludwigshafen – for now still the largest such facility worldwide – it has been enduring billions in losses for years. As a whole, BASF’s business at home, in Germany, is contributing nothing to the company’s profits, at best. If BASF is still doing alright, then not because but in spite of its historic German base. As its former CEO Martin Brudermuller (now with Mercedes Benz, in the other key German industry) put it in 2024, BASF was “making profits everywhere in the world, except Germany.” And that – together with China’s rise (now constituting half of the global chemical industry market) – is why BASF is reducing operations not only in Ludwigshafen but all of Germany, while building a giant new production site in Zhanjiang in China. An up-to-date “mirror image” of the company’s trademark full-integration or composite production concept (“Verbund”) originally pioneered in Ludwigshafen, BASF Zhanjiang is the greatest single investment in the company’s history. In short, Germany’s chemical giant is cloning and optimizing its historic core – not elsewhere in Germany, not in Europe, and not in the US either, but in China. While Brudermüller, an outspoken man, has been warning of Germany’s comprehensive deindustrialization. And though no one will admit it, it is easy to guess what will happen to the dated, ever less competitive original in Ludwigshafen. The open secret of success of BASF’s Ludwigshafen flagship was two-fold: German science and engineering, management, and work ethic played a key role, but so did inexpensive gas from Russia, used as energy source and raw material. Both the German and the Russian inputs were indispensable. Ludwigshafen’s success, as much of the German economy, was a direct result of successful German-Russian, mutually beneficial cooperation. No longer. The EU and Berlin’s – both, ironically, run by Germans – self-destructive policy of re-defining mutual benefits as oh-so-horrible “dependence” to be replaced with some real dependence on the incredibly reliable US and cutting themselves off from Russian natural gas is the decisive factor in Ludwigshafen’s ongoing decline. There are other problems as well, but without this suicidal strategy, longstanding issues – such as, for instance bureaucracy, a mishandled “green transition,” and US tariff warfare – could be resolved or, at least, managed. Yet without inexpensive energy and raw materials, the decline is irreversible. Indeed, by now, BASF is warning of scenarios in which Ludwigshafen will soon stop its gradual descent, but not with recovery. Instead a total crash may loom. The cause? A massive potential gas shortage. None of the above is exceptional in today’s Germany. Of course, economic sectors and individual companies have their specific features. But what matters is how much BASF’s fate represents that of Germany’s economy as a whole. Except the latter is usually worse, often much worse, as in lethal. Consider a few data points: Germany is experiencing a twenty-year peak of insolvencies, as the co-leader of the AfD (Alternative for Germany) party has recently pointed out. And it’s not just Germany’s opposition (and single biggest party in the polls). Even the thoroughly government-aligned de facto state-TV channel ZDF has to admit that “Made in Germany is crumbling.” From 2024 to 2025 alone, 2.1% of Germany’s industrial jobs have gone missing. If you are one of the many Germans busy developing and assembling cars, your chances of employment survival have been even worse: in that sector, a whopping 51,000 or 7% of jobs were axed in just one year – and there’s no end in sight. Profits have been cratering: by over 50% between January and June at Mercedes-Benz, by over a third in the second quarter of 2025 at VW. And that was before some very stable geniuses in Washington made the Dutch government steal – that’s the correct term – Chinese-owned chip maker Nexperia. Inevitably, China is retaliating. Unlike Germany, it’s not run by strange people who take things such as, say, a terrorist attack by “allies” on vital infrastructure with an obsequious grin and a bow. Nexperia is duly out of action and German car companies are among the worst hit by the resulting supply shortages: Hildegard Müller, the head of their national association, has warned of “significant production restrictions, depending on circumstances even full interruptions.” Slow claps for you again, great master trade war strategists of the West. If BASF’s Ludwigshafen is ground zero for the (still) relatively slow decline of the German chemical industry, Stuttgart is shaping up to be one of the cities most devastated by the more rapid fall of the car makers. With 17%, or a quarter of a million, of Stuttgart’s population earning their living from cars – whether at Mercedes-Benz or Porsche directly or one of the many local suppliers, such as much less well-known Mahle or Eberspächer – the city has reason to be afraid. Some are already talking about a bleak future as Germany’s Detroit, the epitome of US rustbelt deindustrialization and dilapidation. The news is certainly not reassuring: Car parts supplier Mahle has already shed 7,000 jobs, for instance. Multinational engineering and technology company Bosch, originally from Stuttgart and now headquartered just a few kilometers to its West, has put 22,000 on the chopping block in Germany as a whole, including almost 2,000 in Stuttgart. Zoom out again, and the picture remains dismal: The reputable Ifo Institute predicts microscopic growth of 0.2% for this year. Next year, they guess, things may look up a little, with 1.3% growth. But even if that actually happens – downward revisions have happened only recently – it is going to be due to the government’s reckless militarist-Keynesian debt-and-spending splurge. Berlin’s current “elite” may be masochists, delighting in taking rough treatment and insults from the US, Ukraine, and even Poland. But Germans as a whole are, of course, less bizarre. By now two thirds are dissatisfied with the coalition in power. If their national misery has a face it is that of its leader, chancellor Friedrich Merz, an ex-BlackRock cadre who charmingly combines tone-deaf, offensive pep talks implying the nation consists of lazy lay-abouts with rants about Russia, drones, and, of course, the AfD, now also accused of being in cahoots with – drumroll – Moscow. Merz, it must be said in Germany’s honor, is unpopularity personified. Think of a German version of Keir “I work for Israel, not you” Starmer in the UK or Emmanuel “please go, please just go!” Macron in France. And that is a sign of national health. In a country whose rulers are systematically running its economy into the ground via an obviously demented policy of self-crippling, popular discontent stands for hope. Perhaps, at long last, enough Germans will soon have had enough.

St Mary’s moved five points clear of the chasing pack atop Division 1A of the All-Ireland League. Ballynahinch, Terenure College and Clontarf are all on 14 points after statement wins, while Lansdowne beat Young Munster 40-35 in the match of the day at Tom Clifford Park. St Mary’s had a bonus point by half-time at UCD when leading 26-10, including a couple of long-range efforts, ultimately scoring seven tries in a 45-24 win. Ex-UCD and Ulster lock Greg Jones and the hard-carrying Dan Goggin had big games. Conor Dean pulled the strings and Mick O’Gara was influential in midfield. Richie Bergin, Rob Gilsenan and Ruairi Shields all scored against their former club, as Mary’s took their haul to 19 points from a possible 20, with what Mark McHugh said was “a professional and clinical” performance. Ballynahinch moved up to second with the day’s standout result, a 25-12 win over Cork Con in Temple Hill. Conor Rankin converted early tries from Ulster winger Aaron Sexton and Chris Gibson. He also landed penalties either side of a Peter Hyland maul try, converted from the touchline by Darragh French, to leave Ballynahinch 20-7 ahead at the break. After Jack Kelleher’s try on the hour, Con had further chances but the visitors’ defence held firm before outhalf Paul Kerr scored from a five-metre scrum. Terenure moved up to third after a second consecutive bonus point win under Carlos Spencer, beating newly-promoted Nenagh Ormond in their first home game of the season, 40-12. Young winger Dan Griffin scored the first of his brace and had Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver in support for the second, but Nenagh reduced the lead to 14-12 by the break. Replacement Joe Coffey finished off a maul before Munster prop Roman Salanoa, making his first start for Nenagh, offloaded for winger Conor McMahon to score. But Terenure pulled clear after hooker Max Russell’s maul try. Culver set up Leinster under-19 backrower Arthur Ashmore on his debut. Offloads by outhalf Aran Egan and Harrison Brewer created Griffin’s slick second before Connacht backrower Oisin McCormack completed the scoring from Will Reilly’s skip pass. Clontarf laid the foundations for their 34-12 bonus-point win at Old Belvedere through their power game, captain Dylan Donnellan scoring his fourth try in four games and 80th in four seasons. The speedy back three of Peter Maher and the O’Grady brothers, Dylan and Alex, combined for one of three unanswered second-half tries. Lansdowne captain Andy Marks was yet again the star in his side’s dramatic win at Young Munster with another brace, the back three of Tom Roche, Sean Galvin, and Leinster Academy youngster Todd Lawlor also scoring. The Cookies trailed 40-21 before tries by Orin Burke and replacement Arron Roulston had them pounding Lansdowne at the death. “Performances have been very good but we’re coming up short,” lamented coach Ger Slattery. Although winless, Munsters have accrued seven bonus points. Long-serving Ulster hooker John Andrew scored a hat-trick on his Instonians debut as they displaced Old Wesley atop the Division 1B table with a 36-14 win at Shaw’s Bridge. In Division 2B, Buccaneers ended a run of 30 consecutive AIL defeats – dating back to a 26-19 victory away to Blackrock in December 2023 – with a 29-21 win in Enniscorthy.

Title: How JPMorgan’s Bitcoin collateral plan could unlock $20 billion in liquidity

As Wall Street giant JPMorgan recognizably embraces crypto assets as loan collateral, industry observers predict a ripple effect among banking institutions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. After years of tension between crypto and traditional finance, a symbolic shift is taking shape inside the world’s largest bank. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly preparing to let institutional clients use Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral for cash loans. This means the bank’s borrowers can pledge the two top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which would be held by approved third-party custodians like Coinbase. The initiative is expected to roll out by the end of 2025. This move is significantly ironic considering the financial giant’s CEO Jamie Dimon is a renowned crypto critic. Notably, he has previously described Bitcoin as a “fraud.” However, increased demands for the emerging industry has forced his hands to support these product launches by his firm. JPMorgan’s move could quietly rewrite the boundaries between digital assets and regulated credit markets. According to Galaxy Research data, open centralized-finance (CeFi) borrows totaled $17.78 billion as of June 30, up 15% quarter-over-quarter and 147% year-over-year. When decentralized loans are included, total outstanding collateralized crypto credit reached $53.09 billion in Q2 2025. This is the third-highest figure on record. These numbers point to a structural shift where borrowing activity rises as digital-asset prices increases. This results in improved credit spreads making loans more attractive for traders and treasuries. Moreover, corporate firms are also tapping crypto-backed lending to fund operations, replacing equity issuance with secured debt against digital assets. In that context, JPMorgan’s entry looks less like an experiment and more like a decisive institutional catch-up move in the emerging industry. Considering this, crypto researcher Shanaka Anslem Perera estimates the model could unlock $10 billion to $20 billion in immediate lending capacity for hedge funds, corporate treasuries, and large asset managers seeking dollar liquidity without selling their tokens. In practical terms, that means firms can now raise capital against digital assets the same way they would against US Treasuries or blue-chip equities. While crypto-collateralized lending is familiar inside DeFi protocols and smaller CeFi lenders, JPMorgan’s participation institutionalizes the concept. The bank’s entry signals that digital assets have matured enough to meet global finance’s compliance, custody, and risk-management standards. Matt Sheffield, the CIO of Ethereum-focused treasury firm SharpLink, believes the development could reshape balance sheet management across asset managers and funds. According to him: “Many traditional financial institutions who rely on trading with banks to date need to choose between holding spot ETH OR other positions. The largest investment bank in the world is here to change that. With the ability to borrow against positions held in third-party custodians, you can build a more productive portfolio, increasing the value of the collateral asset. “ Meanwhile, the decision also strengthens JPMorgan’s broader crypto posture. Over the past two years, the bank has built out Onyx, its blockchain-based settlement network, processed billions in tokenized payments, and explored digital-asset repo transactions. Accepting BTC and ETH as loan collateral completes the loop: issuance, settlement, and credit, all of which touch the blockchain rails. Considering this, Sheffield predicts the move will trigger a “competitive cascade” among large banks. He noted: “This starts a wave. Being first is what scares large institutions. The rest will follow with the decision de-risked, because no action would leave them uncompetitive.” Already, rivals like Citi and Goldman Sachs have expanded digital-asset custody and repo initiatives. BlackRock, meanwhile, has integrated tokenized treasuries (BUIDL) into its fund ecosystem, while Fidelity has doubled its institutional crypto desk headcount this year. Despite Wall Street’s growing embrace of digital assets, challenges remain. Banks entering this market must navigate the intrinsic volatility of cryptocurrencies, uncertain regulatory capital treatment, and persistent counterparty risk—all of which constrain how aggressively they can expand crypto-backed lending. US regulators have yet to issue clear capital-weighting guidelines for digital collateral, leaving institutions to rely on conservative internal models. Even with third-party custodians managing custody risk, supervisory oversight is expected to remain intense. Still, the trajectory is unmistakable because digital assets are gradually being woven into the fabric of global credit markets. Bitcoin analyst Joe Consoerti said these moves show that: “The global financial system is slowly recollateralizing itself around the highest quality asset known to man.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Anne Enright: ‘I’m in a lull. I’m trying to recalibrate after a long decade of elder care’

Time Published: 2025-10-26T05:31:00Z
Full Content:
“I’m in a bit of a lull,” Anne Enright says when I ask what she’s working on. “You wait for a catch, a snag to your interest. “The wonderful Annie Dillard has a story about an Inuit woman who has a baby to feed and no fish, so she slices tiny bits of her own thigh as bait. ‘This is what a writer does,’ she says. That’s Annie Dillard, though, not me.” But the New Yorker magazine recently published Enright’s short story The Bridge Stood Fast, and Jonathan Cape a brilliant career retrospective of her nonfiction, Attention, reflecting on her life, writers and art, and Ireland and the world, so she has been not idle but taking stock. “I’m in a lull because of the world, probably also because my parents are both gone – and the family home. I’m trying to recalibrate after a long decade of elder care for me and my siblings.” Enright’s mother, Cora, died in November 2023, her father, Donal, in June 2016, a few months before Donald Trump was first elected US president. “I lost a wonderful man from my life while the world gained a terrible one,” she wrote in an essay in No Authority, a collection from 2019 of her writings as the inaugural laureate of Irish fiction, in which she addressed, among other things, misogyny and male privilege. “I knew many good men and very few bad ones. Was this male goodness also illusory? What, I wondered, came between these individual, well-intentioned men and the wider enactment of equality?” She reprises the subject in fictional form in her New Yorker story. “Even though the story is set in the 1980s, you want to feel it is saying something relevant to now. The world is so different, you want to meet that change in some way. The story is very strongly based on me going down to Clare with my dad, picking blackberries and mushrooms. I wanted to capture that fantastic thing of having your dad all to yourself when you were 11. Any girl who is stuck on their da, I had access to that easily.” [ Anne Enright: ‘People that go around complaining they don’t win prizes … I always think of Trump and Georgia’Opens in new window ] In the story, the father suddenly has to leave, and a darker masculinity takes centre stage. It asks, if men are more or less good, how did we get saddled with such a damaged patriarchy? There is also an undercurrent of Ireland’s urban-rural divide. Enright once found the New Yorker’s fiction editors “almost anti-voice”, wanting to turn colourful sentences beige, but she has always admired its editing as “a lesson in clarity, foregrounding things the reader needs to know”, one she passes on to her students at University College Dublin, where she is professor of creative writing. “Don’t be hiding things under your jumper. There’s something you’re not telling.” I realised that the people who didn’t like you weren’t going to like you because you won the Booker: they were going to dislike you more Enright has enjoyed consistent critical success since her debut short-story collection, The Portable Virgin, from 1991, won the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. Winning the Booker Prize, with The Gathering, from 2005, made her name internationally. “It was fantastic timing. It very much did its job for me.” She didn’t think she had written a Booker winner. “I was rearing small kids and locked away for a few hours a day in Bray. I was hauling it out of my guts and thought, No one is going to like this.” The late Irish Times literary critic Eileen Battersby was unimpressed. Enright says, “I realised that the people who didn’t like your work weren’t going to change their minds because you won the Booker: they were going to dislike your work more.” In my view she has reached another level with her three most recent novels, The Green Road, Actress and The Wren, The Wren. But despite being up for the Women’s Prize for Fiction five times, “you just know that’s not going to happen. The magic is moving elsewhere,” with “a shift to a cooler female voice”. “You outgrow ideas of fashionability. Writing the sort of book I write, which is interested in style and language, how the sentences fall, it used to be called literary, but things shift. Style in some mouths is a semi-insult. I’m not second-guessing the market. That is the enemy of good writing and a sure way to fail. “There are times late at night you think you’re no good at all, but you learn to live with the uncertainty. Usually for me it’s a structural flaw or unease. I’d break it up or smooth it out a bit. In The Green Road and The Gathering, there are tensions between the book falling apart and coming together. I sometimes wish I could write a book in one style and one voice the whole way through.” All this made winning the $175,000 Windham-Campbell Prize this year a huge and welcome surprise. “I thought those days were gone.” “You always finish a book too quickly,” she says, although she has never worked to a deadline since her debut novel, The Wig My Father Wore, from 1995, “which I missed by two years. I was very neurotic about it in the early days. I wrote with great difficulty. I wrote every day for 30 years. I need to. I’m slightly obsessive and addicted to it.” She usually has two or three nonfiction deadlines, however – work she takes on if she believes it will bring her fiction or thinking on. [ Anne Enright on Edna O’Brien: She never left Ireland, yet couldn’t live here eitherOpens in new window ] “Stylistically, Wig is not showing its age. Is that a very arrogant thing to say? I noticed my New Yorker story is doing what I do, moving from paragraph to paragraph faster than other writers. On one level it is naturalistic, but I can sense that old energy from the first story in The Portable Virgin is still there. “I thought I want to stop doing that now, but it still is the engine that keeps me going, that movement into surprise, the way that the paragraph ends in a way that you don’t expect from its beginning, so there is a bit of a dance going on. I’m not writing modernism like Tom McCarthy, but I’m not writing like William Trevor, either, so there is a conversation between the two.” Enright recognises that some of her novels are couples: The Gathering and The Green Road; Actress and The Wren, The Wren. “They are bookends. They talk to each other. You realise at the end [of writing a novel] that you haven’t done at all what you meant to – if I knew that’s what I was going to do, I would have started out differently – and so you do start out differently.” I wasn’t expecting to be asked about suicidal thoughts 40 years in my past, but I suppose I have always skirted around the difficult feelings of those years Both Actress and The Wren, The Wren “have mythological, supernormal parents. They have a glow, given them by fame, which is shorthand for how we feel about our parents anyway. In The Wren, The Wren I had the advantage of being able to make [Phil the poet] real by making his work real, and so it was a completely different engagement [than with Actress], more exciting. You could give him go, let him have his say. “I’m a great believer in that, which is one of the reasons why my books tend to not fragment but collate, because they have a democratic impulse behind them. You can demonise Phil – he is every kind of foolish bad man – but once you get him speaking you can also experience him. Maybe 20 per cent of my readers on a good day would be male, but I’ve had a good male response to the Phil chapters. My work is political but not ideological.” In other words, it is polyphonic, not just one point of view. [ Anne Enright: ‘I am a proud Dubliner, born and reared. I spurn these lyrical types yearning for the rural’Opens in new window ] Enright reminds me that during the first pandemic lockdown she surprised me by picking a collection of poetry translated from Irish as her summer read. “Poems like The Yellow Bittern and To a Blackbird were moving and also key to my writing The Wren, The Wren. Now the thickets of misogyny are being cleared from Irish letters, I’ve been going back to Irish poetry, a reclamation. “For decades there was almost a hum off Irish work that was not for or about you. I became tired of having to praise it, the lie that it contains, the women’s lives trapped by that sentimentality. But you can’t be too cross when you sit down to write something. You have to let the feeling settle and then go back to reaccess it.” I ask to see Enright’s writing desk, and she surprises me by sitting cross-legged on the sofa in a basement room, where she types on her laptop: “Slow slow, quick quick slow. It’s more of a rhythm, a rush and a stop. Writing by hand feels like a voiceover; this is more in the moment.” Dialogue, she says, shouldn’t all be the same length unless you’re Beckett or Pinter. There is always a power dynamic or a kind of dance going on. “I am very interested in the pattern of interruptions. Women interrupt to be helpful; men interrupt as a territorial thing.” She writes about Ireland but not for it, she says. “I’m very proud of the fact I had the 46A [bus] in every single book. Now it’s gone, I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can put the E2 in.” To write precisely about the imprecise, often ambiguous nature of things is one of Enright’s gifts, so it is no surprise when I ask where she grew up to learn that it was on the borders of Perrystown, Terenure and Templeogue – “postally Dublin 12, religiously Crumlin, and Terenure for the estate agents” – where the Dublin bus stopped and fields began. [ Goodbye to the 46A: End of legendary Dublin bus route made famous in songOpens in new window ] As for class? “It’s an evolving space for me,” she says. “No one along the Dart line, which is so class-bound, believes this, but we were, as far as I knew, indifferent to class. Possibly because we were an academic family, a lot of investment went into that.” Her parents were both civil servants, but with five children to raise, their house was very modest. “My mother came from a falling class – middle class with no money, because her father died just before she was born. She had a Catholic spiritual sense that people were people and shouldn’t be judged for what they had. A lid would be put on notions. “The English novel of a certain decade is obsessed with class, and I’m not interested – those power relations are not my concern – but I am very interested in people’s notions of themselves, and notions in the Irish sense.” She always does a deep dive into her characters’ backgrounds. “I do know where people come from, how they place themselves socially, but then I lose all that and focus on something else about their lives.” Enright was a precocious child. She won a Kodak Instamatic camera for a national essay competition when she was 11. She preferred Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland to The Wind in the Willows, playful and ludic like her father, but disappointing her mother. “It was news to me that reading could be the wrong sort.” Had she been a boy she wouldn’t have been allowed to be a writer, she has said. “I did cause a lot of maternal anxiety. But my father said, ‘I don’t know what she has, but she has something.’” She passed her Leaving Cert at 16, then won a scholarship to a school in Canada, whose headmaster predicted that she would blow the world up with her writing – an unfortunate metaphor. He was not the last male critic to displease her. “I had absolutely no money, and there were lots of people with lots of money, who dressed with confidence, who had travelled.” She studied English at Trinity College Dublin. She tried her hand at writing monologues and acting with friends – Lynn Parker, Pauline McLynn, Declan Hughes – who would form Rough Magic Theatre Company, and Martin Murphy, whom she would marry. She graduated with a first. “When I was trying to place myself as a future writer, I wasn’t thinking of Irish writers at all, but once you go out in the world you are obliged to talk about nothing else. I read all the Frank O’Connors as a child, just reading for pleasure what was in the house, Robert Coover, Donald Barthelme, Marguerite Duras, the modernists. “I was in a state of contention with writers like John McGahern, a kind of argument which is also a very strong connection. I felt he became a little too like his father even while rejecting him, that he was quite paternalistic. For the most part he rose above his damage with considerable grace, but I have an issue sometimes with how his language is laid on the page.” Enright then started writing fragments, a form that the French literary theorist Roland Barthes writes about as having the constant pleasure of beginnings, without arc or resolution. “It works by juxtaposition. It’s a scrap. Wig narratively relied on collage, the feeling that things are either making new meanings or breaking down.” In 1986 she won a scholarship to the University of East Anglia, or UEA, in Norwich, “the back of beyond, middle-class to the max”, for a master’s degree in creative writing taught by Angela Carter and Malcolm Bradbury. Carter nourished the work but was a little condescending. “She asked why I wanted to go back to Ireland – clearly, for her, a very backward, provincial place. If you wanted to be a writer, go to London. I was a bit too Irish for them, unrepressed, a bit of an alien species. But when I fell apart they were very nice.” [ ‘It’s a phenomenon - we’re very privileged’: Contemporary Irish women writers celebrated at symposium in MexicoOpens in new window ] What went wrong? “Young people nowadays know staying up all night is not a good idea. I lived in an evil little room, never went for a walk. There was a lot of student depression. I worked from 8pm to 4am. I lost words. I had no idea what I was writing.” It sounds a bit like Jack Nicholson in The Shining, I say. She laughs. “There was a bit of Barton Fink going on. I was very isolated. I didn’t go down to London. I had no money – £3,000 to get through the year, totally scraping by. Someone offered me a lift to London, then, like a nice English person, turned round and asked me for petrol money, after leaving me in the wrong part of town. “I was increasingly unwell. There were other difficulties. I wasn’t particularly in touch with my family at the time. I do remember people thought you were funny and therefore couldn’t be sad. My counsellor just laughed and laughed. A lot of my 20s were rocky, one way or another.” Ten pages from the end of Making Babies, her memoir of early motherhood from 2006, she quietly drops the bombshell that on Easter Monday 1986 she attempted suicide. People had been living a false life. Denial makes people strange “The older I get the more political I am about depression, or less essentialist – it is not because of who you are, but where you are placed,” she writes. “Ireland broke apart in the eighties, and I sometimes think that the crack happened in my own head. The constitutional row about abortion was a moral civil war that was fought out in people’s homes – including my own – with unfathomable bitterness. The country was screaming at itself about contraception, abortion, and divorce. It was a hideously misogynistic time. Not the best environment for a young woman establishing a sexual identity.” “My mother was very conservative, Catholic,” Enright says; “I was very oppositional, very strong in my own opinions.” Her parents had had four compliant children and didn’t know what to do with her, an overachiever in the wrong way, clever but maverick. “My mother was, or became, hard to please. That relationship didn’t thrive for a number of years until, reluctantly, she came to an accommodation. “Ireland was changing underneath but not on the surface. I wasn’t the only person who had difficulty in that generation. The stories were legion. People had been living a false life. Denial makes people strange.” Suicide is a sensitive topic, and we leave it there, but the author follows up the next day with an email that clarifies things further. “I wasn’t expecting to be asked about suicidal thoughts 40 years in my past, but I suppose I have always skirted around the difficult feelings of those years. I moved in with Martin after college and my mother took very poorly to our ‘living in sin’, so by the time I left for UEA I wasn’t speaking to my family, and then, for reasons that must have made sense at the time, I broke up with Martin too. I had the feeling I was embarking on my writer’s life completely alone, and when the writing did not come good, everything seemed to fall apart for me. That is the scoop, right there.” I wonder how this trauma fed into her writing, the early work experimenting with fragmentation, that falling-apart impulse. Her debut novel features Stephen, an angel who has died by suicide. The Gathering’s eponymous family reunion is triggered by the suicide of a sibling, Liam. A death wish hangs over her short story Night Swim. Difficult mother-child relationships are a recurring feature in her best work. The fault line in families is often generational as much as gendered. It is no wonder her writing is so charged as she captures this. “It’s great to be asked after a million years of no one asking,” she says. “The Gathering has a suicide in it, and I had written about suicide a few years prior to that. Journalists were not reading the same book I had written. The [Booker] prize skewed their idea of what they wanted to talk about. Nobody asked: that’s the exercise of taboo right there. We will talk about everything else and not even notice it. It’s like Poe’s purloined letter: it’s right there in plain view.” That said, “if I was writing The Gathering as a book about suicide, I would have done it differently. Your questions are more personal and my answers are more social: I talk about the environmental, social factors in my life at the time, in a way because the personal is too personal and also, in a way, not fully true, or not enough. You can become unhinged for any number of reasons. [ Honing the craft of the Irish Writers Centre: ‘It’s a great story to tell, as we are a nation of storytellers’Opens in new window ] “The novel, as a form, is really interested in causation. Liam’s sister Veronica looks for a cause in The Gathering and doesn’t find one, except for the fact that Liam very clearly has been abused as a child. But suicide is absolute, death is so absolute, there is no cause big enough to explain it. “After the Booker, some of the journalistic antagonism was so extreme I woke up 20 years later thinking that [abuse] must have happened to them. Though the book is not about the brother’s abuse so much as Veronica’s problem of witnessing it. All that is one of the slowest burns in Irish life. It is only two years since the Blackrock [College sex abuse] scandal surfaced.” Stephen in The Wig “owes a lot to gay Catholic iconography, Latinx gay culture. It’s more a queer reading.” Again, she follows up the next day: “Two things though. The post-suicide angel in The Wig owes something to the feeling that I was in a ‘second’, somehow magical life now. “I am not sure if the writerly impulse towards fragmentation maps absolutely onto the psychological, though I see how you might want to make the connection. Working with fragments is not so limited as linear fiction when it comes to capturing experience – it mimics the way consciousness works, so is a lot more like life. Joyce used fragments. I am fed up saying I have a problem with authority, and that is why I do not write realism. Naturalistic fiction is a lie – and a dull one at that. This is me changing the narrative from your ‘broken’ to my ‘honest’ or even ‘smart’.” Miraculously, despite everything that had happened and not happened in Norwich, Enright came home that summer and spent six weeks at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, the artists’ retreat at Annaghmakerrig, in Co Monaghan, during which she wrote three stories, which were published in a Faber anthology (alongside Hugo Hamilton). Her mother sent her a clipping of an RTÉ ad: “Producer-director wanted”. She got an amazing reference from Malcolm Bradbury, and next thing she was a trainee director at Montrose, alongside Jim Sherwin and Moya Doherty. At a time in Ireland when most young people didn’t even have a job, she was directing live TV shows such as Nighthawks, making great television with the likes of Kevin McAleer and Arthur Riordan, but it was 85 shows a year with no holidays. It was high cortisone, living on her nerves, anarchic. It ended in a breakdown, “which I would now call a burnout”. “How much time and young energy and talent did I throw into that effing organisation,” she wrote. She quit and became a writer full-time. What sort of creative-writing tutor is she? “I feel we are moving towards the American consumer model of education, the idea that you’re going to get doled-out information that will teach you how to write. I feel that is an illusion; it makes the student satisfied with the service but not good on the page. I’m interested in reversing the polarity. I read the students’ work. They will be read, not taught, and be given line edits, as well as a broader response and editorial guidance. There is nowhere else you can get all of that in one place. “I tell them the structure of a sentence is the structure of the writer’s mind. I show them what they are doing on the page and how to see what the work is requiring of them. Getting a conversation going between the page and the artist. Writing as an act of discovery. I love a fresh text: it makes me recognise the provisionality of everything you are doing on the page, because we are all in the same boat, writing badly and then making it better and, finally, good.” Attention: Writing on Life, Art and the World, by Anne Enright, is published by Jonathan Cape on October 30th You can contact Samaritans on freephone 116 123 or by email at jo@samaritans.ie © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

As a player operating in multiple segments — IT office park, exhibition centre, events hosting, food & beverages — Nesco has delivered on multiple fronts and generated stellar gains in its financials in recent years. We had recommended a buy in the stock of Nesco at ₹888 in August 2024. The price has risen sharply over the past year or so. However, the company still remains an attractive bet on the exhibitions, commercial realty and hospitality spaces and is quite reasonably valued even at the current price. At 1,345, the stock trades at 19 times its likely per share earnings for FY26. Though not strictly comparable, most realty players and those focused on commercial real estate trade over 25 times forward earnings and the BSE Realty index trades at a PE of over 48 times. Most hotels trade at multiples in excess of 35 times. Investors can consider buying the Nesco stock even at the current levels with a three-year perspective, given the reasonably attractive valuations and robust traction in its key segments of operations. The company continues to be debt-free as it has remained for the past several years. In the three years from FY22 to FY25, Nesco’s revenue from operations rose at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.5 per cent to ₹732 crore in FY25, while net profits increased at 25.6 per cent over the same period to ₹375.2 crore. After a moderate FY25 (around 8 per cent topline growth year on year), the company’s revenues and net profits have bounced back in Q1FY26 with revenues and net profits increasing 36.8 per cent and 37.8 per cent, respectively in a YoY basis. A good part of the buoyancy is set to continue for the foreseeable future. A net profit margin in excess of 50 per cent is among the best in the industry. Nesco’s return on equity is healthy at 15.23 per cent in FY25. As mentioned earlier, Nesco operates in multiple segments. The company runs an IT park/commercial realty segment with long-term clients. Then there is the Bombay Exhibition Centre that hosts various events, trade fairs, conferences and concerts/shows of star music performers and the like. The foods division is another key segment spanning corporate catering and private parties, MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions), weddings and social events and outdoor catering. There is a minor engineering division (Indabrator). The Nesco IT Park main segment accounts for 50 per cent of the overall revenue of the company. It earns rentals and income from other value-added services rendered to commercial clients. The company’s realty segment has 17.5 lakh sq ft of chargeable area, with 25,000 employees working in the Nesco IT park across 25 clients. Occupants include the likes of HSBC, KPMG, PWC, MSCI, BlackRock, Here Solution, Framestore, Priceline, Ericsson, Apollo Global, ISS Governance, Sodexo and Ericsson. Despite being a tough year for IT and ITeS segments, clients from other industries made up for the slow traction, as the segment itself grew 15.1 per cent in FY25 over FY24. Even in Q1FY26, the segment has grown at a healthy double-digit space. Occupancies in a couple of its towers are nearing 100 per cent by the end of FY25. The next largest revenue segment is the Bombay Exhibition Centre (BEC: 27.4 per cent of revenues in FY25). IIJS Signature and IGJME 2025, National Garment Fair 2025, Acetech 2024, Automation Expo 2024 and HGH 2024 were some of the mega exhibitions hosted in 2025. With the ability to construct stalls based on varied customised requirements, the BEC is able to accommodate visitors on a large scale. There is an events sub-segment within the BEC that hosts live concerts, spiritual meetings and other shows. Also, as it operates in a prime location – Goregaon, it is able to receive significant traction for all events. BEC’s revenue growth bounced back in Q1FY26 with 67.6 per cent rise year on year after an indifferent FY25. Nesco foods is the third largest segment, accounting for 15.7 per cent of revenues in FY25. This segment grew at a healthy 16 per cent in FY25 over FY24. In Q1FY26, the segment’s revenues rose a strong 147.6 per cent. In FY25 alone, the division had 36 new brand partner registrations and tie-ups with 17 event management agencies. As many as 193 corporate clients and 150 weddings were hosted in FY25. According to a research report from Coherent Market Insights, the India meetings, conferences and exhibitions market, which is valued at $4.59 billion in 2025, would grow at a CAGR of 18 per cent from 2025-2032 and reach $14.62 billion by 2032. A reasonably-established player such as Nesco is thus well placed to tap into this growing market over the long term. Its smaller engineering division (6.9 per cent of revenues in FY25), Indabrator, focuses on manufacturing machinery, equipment and capital goods in the surface preparation and allied segments.

Title: Miami’s outgoing mayor warns about what he sees happening in New York and the 2 cities’ different approaches to next summer’s World Cup
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/25/francis-suarez-miami-mayor-interview-zohran-mamdani-world-cup-trump-billionaires/
Time Published: 2025-10-25T13:05:00Z
Full Content:
Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Francis Suarez is proud that an adopted Miamian, FIFA chief Gianni Infantino, will be speaking at the upcoming America Business Forum—as will Infantino’s new chum, President Donald Trump. Suarez, who briefly ran a Republican presidential campaign in 2023, hailed Trump in comments to Fortune, calling the president “one of the most consequential political and business leaders of our time,” adding that his perspective on leadership, global business, and America’s role in the world “will be a defining part of this year’s Forum. We are honored to welcome him to Miami.” Suarez also told Fortune that he’s proud Miami is hosting the second-most World Cup games next summer, including the bronze medal game. After nearly eight years in office, the outgoing mayor is proud of realizing his ambitions to make Miami the “capital of capital,” arguing in an interview with Fortune that it’s “graduated from the capital of Latin America to a truly great global city.” And Suarez has a lot of words for the likely next mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani, including Mamdani’s campaign to force FIFA to change its ticket pricing strategy. “This is sort of government overreach, right?” Suarez said. While offering a significant caveat, noting he is not overly familiar with the specifics of Mamdani’s campaign, which accuses FIFA of “price gouging” and urges it to set aside 15% of tickets at discounted rates for working-class New Yorkers, Suarez pivoted to discussion of housing policy. “You see this in the context of rent controls or price controls,” he said, the first of many broadsides he aimed at what he sees happening in New York City politics. “They seem good in the short run, like it makes you feel good, right? Like, hey, we’re going to control prices.” For his part, Mamdani has framed the issue as one area where government should try to intervene. “Are any working-class New Yorkers actually going to be able to watch any of the matches?” he has asked publicly, accusing FIFA of “pricing working people out of the game that they love” and urging other cities to join his battle against what he described as unchecked greed, as seen in the title of his campaign, “Game over Greed.” ​Mamdani claims FIFA’s dynamic pricing model amounts to “price gouging” as tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup—hosted across 16 cities, with eight matches and the final at MetLife Stadium—will range from $60 up to $6,730, with prices adjusting to demand. In his petition, Mamdani called for caps on resale prices similar to regulations recently adopted in fellow host country Mexico, situating the fight within a broader movement to protect working people from rising costs. ​Mamdani’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment from Fortune. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sat down with Fortune earlier in October at the Most Powerful Women summit in Washington DC, and offered some thoughts on how the business class is regarding Mamdani, weeks out of the mayoral election. Dimon said that if Mamdani is elected, he will offer his help. Calling Mamdani’s Democratic Socialist movement “literally more Marxist than socialist,” Dimon alluded to reports of conversations between the two men and Mamdani’s widely reported charm offensive with New York’s business class. Mamdani is “talking to a lot of people, he’s convinced a lot of people [that] he’s going to change [and] he wants to learn.” As for Suarez, the popular two-term Republican mayor has long insisted on government being open for business and small in scope. “When government intervenes,” Suarez told Fortune, “oftentimes the result is catastrophe, it’s chaos.” He said he sees Miami, on the other hand, as “a city where a rising tide lifts all boats,” noting its exceptionally low unemployment (2.9% as of August) and high median wage growth (Asana found it was the highest in the nation from 2020 to 2023, outpacing inflation). Suarez told Fortune he thinks he’s been a successful mayor because of deliberate policy choices that focused government on narrow quality-of-life issues, a business-friendly attitude, and striking while the iron was hot. He reminded Fortune that it all started with a viral tweet back in December 2020, when he took the idea of transforming South Beach into Silicon Valley seriously. It was far behind his goal coming in, when he merely wanted to help Miami transition away from an industrial economy. That tweet helped him realize, he said, “that there was an inflection point that would allow us to hyperscale.” He said he was an opportunity to squeeze 30 years’ worth of growth into just three or four, and that he’d be proud to be remembered as a social-media mayor. Suarez said he was wary of Mamdani. “My parents came from a country [in Cuba] where a young, charismatic leader made the same promises. And he did create equality: He created equality of misery, suffering, poverty.” Still, Suarez and Mamdani have some things in common, especially their telegenic, social-media savvy rises to fame, albeit from opposing political poles. When this dynamic is pointed out, especially the central role of social media in their campaigning, Suarez says he “thinks that’s true,” while quickly clarifying that “anybody who’s young, presumably, is going to be good on social media, right?” Suarez would rather talk about what he sees Mamdani ultimately selling to likely voters: “Are you selling a future that’s going to make things better, or are you selling a road to perdition? And I think he’s selling a road to perdition, whether he’s doing it intentionally or not, whether he actually believes that he can make things better. I have no idea. I don’t know him personally.” Suarez is eager to reel off the top names he’s recruited to Miami, whether it’s billionaires, celebrities, or major employers. He notes that besides Infantino, the city has attracted Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady, soccer superstar Lionel Messi, and hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin. “These are people that could live anywhere in the world and have chosen to live in Miami.” Suarez notes that he’s an anomaly as the first native-born Miami mayor, and Miami is known for being made up of adopted Miamians. The mayor also listed Miami’s leading lights in business, with firms such as BlackRock, Blackstone, and Citadel all opening local offices or even headquarters locally. “We’ve attracted companies that manage close to $13 trillion in assets,” he said, and it’s adding notable conferences along with attractions like Formula One and the new Inter Miami soccer stadium. This has all put stress on Miami’s infrastructure, Suarez acknowledged, saying Miami is in some ways a victim of its goal to become “Wall Street South.” He said there’s “definitely a gentrification happening in Miami,” and it has gotten expensive. In fact, UBS Global Wealth Management’s annual Real Estate Bubble Index, published in late September, put Miami at the very top spot of its global “bubble risk index,” backing Suarez’s argument that it is truly a global city after explosive growth under his tenure. The nearest American cities to Miami on UBS’ list were Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, respectively. The Swiss bank noted that Miami’s bubble risk had actually decreased since 2024 and over the past five years, Miami and the similarly sunny and wealthy Dubai have led the pack, averaging real price growth of roughly 50%. Among all the bubbly real-estate markets, UBS found Miami posting the strongest inflation-adjusted housing appreciation over the past 15 years. Affordability is still near record lows, but housing inventory has rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels as of 2025. “Miami’s coastal appeal and favorable tax environment continue to attract newcomers from the U.S. West and Northeast,” the report noted, with international demand remaining robust, particularly from Latin America. Suarez blames too many New Yorkers moving in for the inflated real-estate prices. “When people come in, it does put stress on our price affordability. We used to be a lot more affordable than New York, until all the New Yorkers came and now we’re close in price.” He said he sees this continuing under the likely mayorship of Mamdani. “The sense that I have … as interest rates go down, plus people fleeing New York, there will be another wave. You feel it, you sense it, it’s going to have a 20%, 30% impact on values.” Suburban New York realtors say they are seeing a “Mamdani effect” of more moderate and conservative New Yorkers fleeing ahead of Mamdani’s election, with home sales in contract spiking 15% year-over-year per one local firm. Within the city, Alexander Carter, a licensed real-estate salesperson with the Corcoran Group, previously told Fortune that she had “never seen this type of reaction to a mayor,” having worked in real estate for three or four different tenures. “It’s been pretty drastic. After he won the primary we had a companywide call on implications for business because of the ‘rent freezes.’” She said the Mamdani effect comes down to one thing: “People are afraid it will be bad for business.” Suarez insists that he doesn’t want Miami to succeed while New York is failing. “I think you want every great American city to succeed.” New York City, by the way, is the only metro area that will host more World Cup games than Miami—all of them across the river, in nearby New Jersey. Although, President Trump has recently hinted that he’ll seek to strip World Cup games from cities that he doesn’t like. Miami surely wouldn’t be one of those. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: What went wrong in the Heather Humphreys campaign
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2025/10/25/what-went-wrong-in-the-heather-humphreys-campaign/

Heather Humphreys is standing in the paddock of a farm in Slane, Co Meath, recalling a visit “to a lovely restaurant in Singapore to promote Irish duck”. “The best duck in the world, in my view,” Humphreys tells a handful of bored reporters. Over her shoulder, in the field behind her, one amorous bovine mounts another. A rabble of Fine Gael farmers stand with Heather stickers on their lapels, ready to clap. It feels like a Fine Gael event rather than a campaign one. Among supporters such as these, no votes will be lost, but no votes will be won either. Elsewhere, a presidential campaign for the remaining 80 per cent of the electorate is taking place. In the mire of its 1990 presidential election, where Fine Gael came last of three candidates including a Fianna Fáil tánaiste who was sacked mid-campaign, some in the party decried a campaign that sent Austin Currie out to “shake hands with Ireland”. This time around, the Humphreys campaign against Independent rival Catherine Connolly seemed to focus on sending her out to shake hands with the roughly 20 per cent of Ireland that already votes for Fine Gael. [ Follow our Presidential election live blog: Connolly on course for landslide win; huge number of spoiled votesOpens in new window ] This narrow focus cost the party dearly as Connolly romped to victory over Humphreys. During the campaign, there were entire days when reporters following Humphreys wouldn’t see her encounter a single undecided voter. At what felt more like Fine Gael events than general campaign events, Humphreys would meet people who had decided long ago they were voting for her and were wearing the campaign stickers to prove it. The campaign rarely gravitated far from the comfortable terrain of events of Tidy Towns and credit unions. Spontaneous encounters with the electorate became rare. In a breakneck walkabout of Grafton Street in Dublin, the Humphreys campaign took the busy thoroughfare at a canter – effectively meeting no voters at all before retreating into Bewley’s cafe, where supporters waited. On the very last day of the campaign, watching Humphreys charm a delighted crowd of 500 at the Irish Country Living women and agriculture conference in Sligo, her team started to regret that the public still had not seen “the real Heather”. Even before polls had closed, Fine Gael argued Humphreys had been plunged into the bruising election at late notice. But revisionists of the very recent past omit to mention that Humphreys was swept into the race on the crest of an organic wave of support from TDs. Many within the party were so convinced of her broad appeal, they thought they had a better candidate than Mairead McGuinness, the party’s original candidate, who dropped out of the race due to ill-health. On the windy prom in the middle class area of Blackrock, Co Louth on October 1st, former Fianna Fáil TD Declan Breathnach happened to show up to endorse Humphreys in front of the media. Humphreys’s cross-party appeal in the Border counties was never in question. What will be scrutinised now is if it was ever developed beyond. In 1944, the American journalist Franklin P Adams wrote that elections are won “chiefly because most people vote against somebody rather than for somebody”. By the final week of the campaign, a pessimism had calcified within the Fine Gael parliamentary party that this presidential election had become a referendum on the Government and so Humphreys’s candidacy as a former minister was doomed. A minority within the party say their impression was more “genuine disinterest” from the public. Fine Gael’s ground war spent a lot of time trying to make a virtue of Humphreys’s tenure at the cabinet table, with the campaign mapped around projects Humphreys had supported. The internal schedule used by the campaign team often had a note beside each location of how much government funding the venue had received under Humphreys’s tenure as minister for community development. Fine Gael tried to ensure that the proverbial eaten bread was not forgotten. As Connolly’s lead grew, so did Fine Gael’s frustration with the coverage of their “Teflon” rival. “If Heather had been repossessing houses and meeting warlords, we would have had to pull out of the campaign,” one source said. Humphreys’s own media performances could be ropey. She was not prepared for questions about her husband’s former membership of the Orange Order and was hurt by them. Some in Fine Gael feel that there was an immaturity whereby some people failed to grasp that it would have been unusual for a Monaghan Presbyterian family at the time not to have some links with the Orange Order. The presidential campaign was said to be the first time Humphreys had real experience of social media abuse. There were a couple of occasions when it really got to her, according to campaign aides. On the margins of the RTÉ Prime Time debate, the last of the campaign, an adviser sighed in despair: “The same questions again.” Entire days on the campaign trail had been written off by the demands of media debates and interviews. Everyone in the campaign accepted that when the camera was on, their candidate’s personality was off. Her uncertainty fared poorly when compared with Connolly’s assured performances. Senior Fine Gael figures blame the departure of Fianna Fáil’s candidate Jim Gavin for sealing their defeat, and denying Humphreys transfers. Allies are deeply disappointed with Fianna Fáilers who couldn’t countenance supporting her even when their own candidate wasn’t running. Within the Humphreys campaign some called these diehard party members “Black Fianna Fáilers”. With some exceptions, Fine Gael felt its Coalition colleagues were lethargic in their opposition to Connolly. As polling day drew nearer, Fine Gael TDs were fielding more and more complaints from supporters who wanted to know “why our posters aren’t as good”. By Friday, Fine Gael was stressing that Connolly had enjoyed the financial backing of Sinn Féin, “the richest party in the State”. It was only in the final week that Fine Gael started to truly appreciate that its one party press office was competing against the five party press offices supporting Connolly. One night in the second last week of the campaign, a gloom descended on the campaign. Details of The Irish Times/Ipsos B&A opinion poll the following morning had started to leak: Connolly was close to lapping Humphreys at 38 per cent to 20 per cent, the poll showed. Febrile panic was followed by cold certainty: Fine Gael had to arrest Connolly’s momentum. And so came one of the defining moments of the campaign, when a now infamous attack video was released that accused the left-wing candidate of hypocrisy for her role acting as a barrister for banks in repossession cases. [ The three viral moments that swung the election campaign for Catherine ConnollyOpens in new window ] Senior Fine Gael figures outside of the core campaign were somewhat mystified by the decision to focus on repossessions rather than compiling a video of things Connolly has said about the European Union. The video was accompanied by a front-page story in the Sunday Independent, where Humphreys implied that Connolly had made money “out of people’s misfortune”. It didn’t work. And it pushed Humphreys into even more uncomfortable terrain. In the last week of the campaign, what should have been a strong press conference surrounded by independent supporters such as Independents Michael Healy-Rae and Marian Harkin became one of Humphreys’s worst. Asked about her comments just days previously, she tried to resile from them: “No, I did not say that. I did not say that ... no, please, I did not say that.” This weekend, Fine Gael consoled itself by comparing this outcome with the nadir of its presidential elections: the 6.4 per cent result for Gay Mitchell in the 2011 presidential election. Some of Humphreys’s team were emotional on Friday, from the bittersweet cocktail of pride and disappointment. Most people emerge from presidential campaigns destroyed. Her allies at least feel that Humphreys has lost with grace. “She can leave it with her head held high,” one friend said. Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: The 5 unbelievable crypto comeback stories that changed the world forever

Are these the definitive crypto comebacks? Plus some of the most notable failures. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto is nothing if not cyclical. Every cycle births icons, wrecks them, and sometimes resurrects them. What was once written off as dead can roar back to life with a vengeance, reshaped by regulation, technology, or sheer market gravity. From courtrooms to codebases, from bankrupt exchanges to blockchains that refused to quit, the industry’s best comeback stories reveal something deeper than price action, they show crypto’s strange, relentless capacity to rebuild itself. These are the five most extraordinary revivals in crypto history, plus a few spectacular failures that never made it back. The fall. After 2017’s mania, XRP became a regulatory pariah. Major U.S. exchanges delisted it as the SEC’s lawsuit dragged through years of uncertainty, crushing liquidity and sentiment. The turn. Judge Analisa Torres’ July 2023 ruling that programmatic XRP sales weren’t securities reopened the U.S. market. Coinbase, Kraken, and others relisted the token, while 2025 brought closure, final civil penalties and no meaningful appeal path left. The legal fog that defined XRP’s lost years finally lifted. Where it stands today. XRP trades around $2.40 and ranks #5 by market cap, rejoining the upper echelon of crypto assets after half a decade in exile. The comeback isn’t just about price; it’s about legitimacy regained. Forward outlook. What to watch: XRPL volumes vs. stablecoin settlement growth, upcoming ETP approvals in the U.S. or EU, and on-exchange depth and basis spreads versus ETH and SOL. A courtroom comeback matured into a market-cap comeback. XRP is a top-five coin again, this time anchored less by hype than by the vacuum left as regulators inch toward rules for tokenized payments. The fall. In November 2023, Binance’s years-long regulatory standoff climaxed in a $4.3 billion settlement with the DOJ, FinCEN, OFAC, and CFTC. Founder Changpeng Zhao pled guilty to a single BSA violation and resigned, closing one of the most consequential enforcement cases in crypto history. The turn. Two optics shifts defined 2025. First, Binance proved structurally resilient, after ceding BTC-futures volume leadership to CME in 2024, it regained market share across spot and derivatives through mid-2025. Second, Trump’s October 2025 pardon of CZ softened the exchange’s U.S. stigma, hinting at eventual regulatory thawing even as licensing remains complex. Where it stands today. BNB broke through $1,000 on September 18, 2025, setting a new all-time high and delivering a clean, visual narrative of redemption, from legal nadir to renewed dominance. Forward outlook. What to watch: Kaiko market-share data, monitor wind-down timelines, court filings on U.S. operations, and quarterly BNB burns. Regulatory winter melted into political spring, the coin of crypto’s most embattled exchange just printed four digits. The fall. In 2021–22, Solana went from darling to damaged. Outages, congestion, and the FTX collapse left its reputation in tatters. “Ethereum killer” became a punchline as downtime and venture overexposure crushed sentiment. The turn. Fast forward to 2024–25: uptime has gone spotless, and usage has gone parabolic. The network has logged 100% reliability over the past 60 days, with multi-month streaks signaling true technical maturity. Memecoins turned Solana into the epicenter of retail speculation, while tokenized assets (Backed’s equities, Ondo’s USDY) signaled a new institutional chapter. The same chain that once crashed under load now clears billions in daily volume without breaking stride. Where it stands today. Solana’s DEX volume has regularly matched or topped Ethereum’s throughout 2025, with memecoin bursts acting as its native volatility engine. SOL trades near multi-year highs, backed by liquidity depth and a visibly sticky developer base. Forward outlook. What to watch: status.solana.com uptime metrics, Firedancer mainnet progress, RWA TVL and issuance, DEX share versus ETH/Base, and total stablecoin float on Solana. First came the memes; now come the treasuries. Solana’s comeback is morphing from speculative to structural. The fall. The 2016 DAO hack fractured Ethereum into ETH and ETC, a philosophical schism that could have killed the project. The turn. The Merge in September 2022 cemented Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake. Dencun and EIP-4844 brought cheap data availability for rollups, unlocking explosive L2 growth. Then came the 2024–25 wave of U.S. spot ETH ETF approvals, pulling the asset into the same regulated orbit as Bitcoin. By 2025, Layer 2 adoption had become the backbone of daily Ethereum usage. Where it stands today. ETH reclaimed the $4,000 level in 2025, with L2s processing roughly 80–90% of ecosystem transactions. Ethereum now operates more as a global settlement and data layer than a single execution environment. Forward outlook. What to watch: ETH ETF flow dashboards (Farside, CoinShares), L2Beat throughput and TVL, blob fees post-4844, and net staking flows. From a chain that once rewrote history to survive, Ethereum now writes it, inside brokerage accounts and atop a sprawling L2 economy. The fall. 2018’s “crypto winter” and the 2020 COVID crash minted literal obituary headlines. Bitcoin was written off as a speculative relic, the bubble that burst twice. Retail volumes vanished, miners capitulated, and mainstream finance moved on. By late 2020, “Bitcoin is dead” had been declared more than 400 times. Yet beneath the despair, hash rate resilience and global developer persistence quietly kept the chain alive. The turn. After the 2020 halving a speculation filled COVID bubble late in the year and into 2021 saw Bitcoin smash previous all-time highs and reach $69,000. However, the subsequent bear market, made worse by systemic crash fueled by the fall of FTX saw Bitcoin fall below $15,000 once more and obituaries returned. Down but not out, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in January 2024 rewrote the narrative from fringe speculation to formal asset class. What began as a decade-long lobbying effort by Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity culminated in the single biggest bridge ever built between crypto and traditional finance. Within weeks, billions flowed into the new ETFs; by mid-2025, BTC had joined the likes of gold and the S&P 500 in brokerage model portfolios. The macro environment, rate cuts, de-dollarization chatter, and renewed safe-haven demand, did the rest. BTC pierced $100,000 in December 2024 and notched a fresh all-time high near $126,000 in October 2025 as ETF inflows re-accelerated. CME’s open-interest share in Bitcoin futures topped 55%, marking Wall Street’s full arrival. On-chain, long-term holder supply hit record highs even as ETF issuers led by BlackRock accumulated spot reserves. Where it stands today. Bitcoin now trades less like a frontier asset and more like macro collateral. It sits in pension fund allocations, Treasury portfolios, and ETF baskets, governed by audited custodians and daily flow data. The 2024 halving reinforced supply discipline, while ETF creations institutionalized demand. Even skeptics now reference Bitcoin’s implied yield, futures basis, and ETF premium as if it were a fixed-income instrument. Forward outlook. What to watch: Daily ETF flow dashboards, CME vs. offshore perpetuals basis spreads, aggregate stablecoin market cap as a proxy for global liquidity, and realized volatility versus Nasdaq beta. Bitcoin’s return marked the moment the world’s first decentralized alternative to fiat became impossible to contain. Once dismissed as a fringe experiment, it has now infiltrated Wall Street as a Trojan horse for monetary sovereignty: regulated, measurable, and yet utterly beyond control. With over $2 trillion in value and adoption stretching from retail wallets to pension funds, Bitcoin remains as the only true ‘freedom money.’ While seemingly ‘innocent’ compared to the rest of the failures on this list, STEPN’s fall from grace was meteoric. At one point it seemed that move-to-earn was going to reshape the entire crypto ecosystem with an amazing new use case for NFTs. Users and revenue surged in early 2022 as STEPN’s move-to-earn model went viral, with daily active users topping 700,000 and SOL network fees spiking from in-app minting and trades. At its peak, Genesis sneakers sold for thousands of dollars and the project’s GMT token rallied nearly 30x from launch. But within months, D30 retention cratered as anti-bot updates, GST inflation, and regional bans hit engagement. By late 2022, DAU and revenue had collapsed more than 90% from their highs, sneaker minting froze, and marketplace activity dwindled. Marketed from 2014 to 2017 as a revolutionary digital currency, OneCoin raised over $4 billion from investors worldwide despite lacking any blockchain. Founder Ruja Ignatova, later dubbed the “Cryptoqueen,” vanished in 2017 after global authorities began investigating the scheme. Co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Ignatova remains on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. OneCoin’s collapse became a cautionary tale of unchecked hype, opaque operations, and the dangers of centralized “crypto” without cryptography. Once handling over 70% of Bitcoin trades, Mt. Gox’s 2014 collapse became crypto’s first major catastrophe, losing 850,000 BTC and destroying public trust. After years of bankruptcy proceedings and creditor battles, 2024 finally saw repayments begin in Bitcoin and fiat. The case’s slow resolution marked a milestone in crypto’s legal maturation, with recovered assets exceeding expectations and signaling that even the industry’s darkest chapter could find partial redemption. The hedge fund’s 2022 implosion wiped out billions in counterparty exposure, triggering cascading liquidations across Celsius, Voyager, and Genesis. Founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu resurfaced with OPNX in 2023, an exchange centered on claims trading, but it launched under regulatory headwinds and low volumes. Dubai VARA fined the team in May 2023, Singapore’s MAS issued prohibition orders that September, and activity remained thin through 2024 and into 2025 versus peers. Attempts to add derivatives and new listings failed to regain share, with enforcement actions and a punctured trust loop defining the platform’s shallow depth. UST lost its dollar peg in May 2022, triggering a rapid unwinding as Anchor withdrawals surged and LUNA’s supply hyperinflated. The ecosystem’s value evaporated within weeks, and Terra 2.0 with LUNC attempted to reboot without an algorithmic stablecoin. The revival failed to regain traction, with most Terra projects either shutting down or migrating to Cosmos and other chains. Once the epicenter of crypto’s most devastating fraud, FTX’s 2022 implosion vaporized tens of billions in customer assets and shattered institutional confidence. Yet by 2024, bankruptcy administrators had liquidated vast holdings, recouping nearly all verified creditor claims, an outcome few deemed possible. While the exchange itself remains defunct, its asset recovery and the criminal accountability of key figures marked an unprecedented legal turnaround, showing crypto’s capacity for both catastrophic failure and structured restitution. Banking rails broke in 2022, then INR deposits restarted in 2024 with a new partner and FIU registration. Spot volumes, INR-pair depth, and on-ramp uptime improved through 2024 with maker rebates on INR-USDT. The path to a full comeback requires deeper INR books and durable bank connectivity over multiple quarters. The venue opened in late 2023, delivered a SOC 2 Type I in January 2024, launched BTC and ETH perpetuals under a Bermuda license in April, and shipped live proof-of-reserves in June. Spot and perp volumes climbed while spreads tightened, and the status page recorded no sev-1 incidents. The upgrade trigger is sustained depth within a top-tier cohort, plus enacted licenses in larger jurisdictions. Tokenized treasuries and real-estate issuance grew from early 2024 into early 2025 with custody attestations and regulator touchpoints, while secondary volumes formed on the project’s venues. A true comeback would hinge on redemption depth across market stress and a broader licensing footprint. After a 2024 audit and a privacy impact filing, integrations with wallets, exchanges, and dapps increased, attestations climbed, and version 2 added revocation and recovery in February 2025. The remaining watch items are privacy governance and attester decentralization. BIO added revocation and recovery to its attestations in February 2025 and ended the quarter with more than 1.8 million cumulative proofs issued. When the dust settles, the market does not clap, it checks. Courts file their orders, clients sync, miners tighten costs, market makers quote the inside, and the tape prints. The names that made it back are the ones that took the hit, changed the machinery, and kept clearing. The story ends where it always does here, with depth on the screen and blocks in the chain.

Title: EU stalls on seizing Russian assets for Ukraine loan amid legal fears

Belgium blocked consensus on using frozen Russian assets (â¬140 billion/$163 billion) as collateral for Ukraine, demanding stronger legal safeguards. Belgian PM Bart De Wever threatened legal and political resistance unless conditions were met, forcing a watered-down compromise. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that delays weaken Ukraine's defenses and slow EU progress. Kyiv pledged to spend funds on European weapons and air defenses, but EU leaders postponed final approval until December. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called any seizure "theft" and vowed legal retaliation. Russia has already seized Euroclearâs assets in response to sanctions and may escalate if the EU moves forward. Experts warn Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, destabilizing Western finance. If Russia reclaims assets, the U.S. may default on Ukraine-related loans, accelerating dollar decline. The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance, with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens, with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution.

The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance, with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens, with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution. European Union (EU) leaders have delayed plans to use frozen Russian assets to finance a massive â¬140 billion ($163 billion) loan for Ukraine after Belgium demanded stronger legal safeguards, throwing negotiations into disarray. The move comes as Russia warns of severe financial and legal repercussions if the West proceeds with what Moscow calls outright "theft." At a Brussels summit on Thursday, Oct. 23, EU officials failed to reach an agreement on whether to use immobilized Russian central bank funds as collateral for Ukraine's war effort. Belgium, which holds legal control over the bulk of the frozen assets through Brussels-based Euroclear, insisted that all EU members share responsibility if the plan backfires. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever took a firm stance, stating:Â "If demands are met, we can go forward. If not, I will do everything in my power at the European level, also at the national level, politically and legally to stop this decision."Â His opposition forced a compromise text that merelyÂ "invites the [EU] Commission to present, as soon as possible, options for financial support,"Â rather than committing to the loan outright. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, attending the summit as a guest, urged immediate approval of the loan, warning that delays would weaken Ukraine's defenses. "Anyone who delays the decision on the full use of frozen Russian assets is not only limiting our defense, but also slowing down the EU's own progress,"Â he said. Kyiv pledged to use much of the funds to purchase European weapons and bolster air defenses. However, EU leaders, wary of legal blowback, postponed a final decision until December. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the complexity, stating:Â "This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex." Russia warns of financial and legal repercussions Moscow has repeatedly condemned the West's efforts to repurpose Russian funds, calling it illegal confiscation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that any seizure wouldÂ "boomerang"Â on the EU, adding:Â "If someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another." Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev reinforced this stance, stating that Moscow has no plans to retaliate against European assetsâunless the EU moves first. "We are not confiscating anything yet. The Europeans haven't called for confiscation, so we won't confiscate anything until they do. If they do end up confiscating, then we will consider it,"Â he said. According to the Enoch AI engine at BrightU.AI,Â Russia's stance on the EU's plan to seize frozen Russian assets is one of strong opposition and condemnation, viewing it as a brazen act of theft and a violation of international law. Russia's stance is clear and resolute: it views the move as a violation of international law and a hostile act that it will not tolerate. Russia has taken countermeasures and threatened further action to protect its assets and economy. Legal experts warn that Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, potentially reclaiming seized assets and destabilizing Western finance. Financial analyst Jim Rickards has cautioned that such a scenario could trigger a crisis, exposing the West'sÂ "theft scheme"Â and leaving financial institutions scrambling. Broader implications: A financial and geopolitical quagmire The stalled EU plan underscores deeper concerns about Ukraine's financial viability. Reports indicate Kyiv is already on the brink of default, withÂ 20 billion in suspended debt payments to investors like BlackRock. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces its own dilemmaâif Russia successfully reclaims frozen assets, Washington may default on obligations tied to Ukraine's 50 billion loan, accelerating the dollar's decline. As the EU scrambles for a legally defensible solution, the standoff highlights the growing risks of weaponizing finance in geopolitical conflicts. With no clear resolution in sight, the fate of Ukraine's fundingâand the stability of Western financial systemsâhangs in the balance. The EU's hesitation reveals a stark reality: The West's financial warfare against Russia may carry unforeseen consequences. As legal doubts mount and Moscow prepares its counterstrike, the global financial order teeters on the edge of upheavalâone that could redefine power dynamics far beyond Ukraine's battlefields.

Title: Utility bills spike as power-hungry AI data centers boom, Bank of America report finds

The rapid rollout of power-hungry AI data centers could be straining the US energy grid and causing utility bills to spike – and prices could get worse in the coming months, according to economists. Americans spent 3.6% more on electricity and gas in the third quarter of this year than they did during the same time last year, according to a study led by Bank of America economist David Tinsley. Taking a longer view, electricity prices rose 5.1% over the past 12 months through September, while gas service went up a whopping 11.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. That came as the feds and state governments have been offering financial incentives for companies to build data centers. There are over 4,000 such sites throughout the US today, according to datacentermap.com, though there is no official count. “The rising demand for electricity generation capacity and grid investments, due in part to the build-out of data centers, appears to be placing more upward pressure on bills,” stated the Bank of America report, which was released last week. When electrical grids get enhanced to accommodate increased power demands from new data centers, at least some of the cost appears to get passed on to consumers, the report explained. On top of that, the increased use of electric vehicles has added to electricity demand, helping to keep prices high, according to the study. More price hikes could be in store this winter. “Consumers may again feel the pressure on their utility bills in the coming months, particularly if the winter is a cold one,” BofA’s report warned. Electricity and natural gas prices actually ticked down slightly from August to September, according to the Consumer Price Index, though that’s likely due to consumers flipping off the A/C and waiting to turn on the heat. Meanwhile, expanding the US power grid faces a number of barriers, with massive amounts of capital needed to build “more generation and transmission capacity,” the BofA report stated. Regulatory hurdles and supply chain pressures also pose a roadblock, according to the analysis, who pointed to difficulties acquiring large turbines. BofA warned that higher utility bills could hammer overall consumer spending. Americans are already concerned about higher prices, sinking consumer sentiment to a five-month low in October, according to a University of Michigan report released Friday. Average utility payments over the summer varied by city. Chicago and Tampa, Fla., for example, saw much higher bills, while prices dropped in Las Vegas. It was notably hot this summer in parts of Phoenix – so prices increased alongside the demand for cooling, the study said. Higher utility bills also tend to disproportionately hit lower-income households, which are already dealing with slower wage growth, according to BofA’s report. Despite intense pressure on the grid, tech giants have continued to announce massive investments in AI infrastructure. Just last week, a group of investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk’s xAI agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion.t Earlier this year, President Trump announced that SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle plan to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years through the Stargate project.

The ripple effect of the four provinces all dipping deep into their reserves while the Ireland squad is in Chicago is that some All-Ireland League clubs have been obliged to do likewise. For example, Terenure beat Lansdowne with an impressive display under lights on the Aviva back pitch a couple of weeks ago in an encounter which was much more competitive than the final 34-13 score line indicated. Evidence of the game’s high quality is that Leinster have picked three of the Lansdowne starting XV – prop Jerry Cahir, hooker Bobby Sheehan and fullback Hugo McLoughlin – to face Zebre, as well as the Terenure pair of outhalf Caspar Gabriel and hooker John McKee. New signing Julien Valleise will make his third league start for Lansdowne in the front row away to Young Munster, while Sean Galvin and Tom Roche feature in the back three, with Todd Lawlor reverting to fullback. Evan O’Connell, Ruadhan Quinn, Shay McCarthy, and Jake O’Riordan are on Munster duty, so Harry Langbridge, Orin Burke, John Poland, Christian Foley, Oran O’Reilly, and Stephen McLoughlin come in to the Cookies team. After three one-score defeats, and a couple of attacking bonus points, Young Munster will be striving for a win. Ditto for Lansdowne after losing two of their first three outings. Terenure have their first home game under Carlos Spencer against newly-promoted Nenagh Ormond, who will be making their first-ever visit to Lakelands Park. Spencer makes six changes, Leinster under-19 talent Arthur Ashmore coming in to the back row. Nenagh came up just short of a first point in Division 1A in losing 25-17 to Cork Con a fortnight ago. Munster prop Roman Salanoa will make his first start for the club, while Argentinian Mateo Sentous, Jake O’Kelly and John O’Flaherty have also been added to the pack. Alex Usanov’s Leinster call-up has contributed to one of Clontarf’s three changes for their first visit to Old Belvedere in nine years, with Ivan Soroka, Ben Griffin and Jim Peters returning to the tight five. Hugh Flood replaces Hugo O’Malley in Belvo’s only change. St Mary’s, the only unbeaten team after three rounds, travel to UCD with all their big guns in situ, with Aaron O’Neill and Leandro Ramirez added to their back three. Centre Ben Brownlee returns from a spell with North Harbour in the NPC for UCD, who also welcome back Leinster Academy lock Conor O’Tighearnaigh. Cork Constitution, who sit second after successive wins, host free-scoring Ballynahinch, who are third after Ethan Graham’s six-try salvo last time out against UCD. Old Wesley, the only team with three wins in Division 1B, travel north to last season’s champions Instonians. Leinster Academy flyer Paidi Farrell will make his first start of the new season for Wesley, while Ulster’s John Andrew will make his debut for the home side. The 2B leaders Galwegians host fourth-placed Malone, just a point behind them, at Crowley Park. Galwegians also top the women’s league and take that unbeaten record to eighth-placed Cooke. All-Ireland League fixtures: (Saturday, 2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Old Belvedere v Clontarf, Ollie Campbell Park; Terenure College v Nenagh Ormond, Lakelands Park; UCD v St Mary’s College, Belfield; Young Munster v Lansdowne, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: Did Trump agree to 'bail out' Argentina? Unpacking the claim
URL: https://www.snopes.com//news/2025/10/24/trump-argentina-bailout/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T17:51:00Z
Full Content:
During the U.S. federal government shutdown in October 2025, rumors spread that President Donald Trump sent a multibillion-dollar "bailout" to help stabilize Argentina's economy using taxpayers' money. For example, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries commented on the alleged bailout in a statement to the press on Oct. 15 (archived): It's perplexing to us that Republicans refuse to spend a dime to protect the healthcare of the American people, but somehow the Trump administration found $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina in ways that are also going to continue to hurt our soybean farmers in Iowa and in the Midwest. That's outrageous. This is corruption in real time. Critics lambasted the purported deal, with some saying the money would have been better spent paying air traffic controllers or government-covered health care costs during the shutdown. An anti-corruption nonprofit RepresentUs claimed on X the move benefited wealthy U.S. investors who supposedly bet on Argentina's economic success such as Robert Citrone, of Discovery Capital Management, an alleged close acquaintance to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (archived). (Snopes unpacks the origin and facts of that specific assertion, below.) It is true that the U.S. government said it agreed to help stabilize Argentina's economy with billion-dollar funding packages. First, it said it agreed to sending $20 billion and then it said it aimed to double that number. The Trump administration said on Oct. 9 that it had pledged the money, according to an X post by Bessent. The government inked the agreement on Oct. 20, according to another post by Bessent and a statement by Argentina's central bank. The administration said the move was strategic, tying it to an effort to maintain influence over Argentina — the Americas' southernmost country — against China. Some critics of the Trump administration framed the bailout as a gift using taxpayer dollars, and financial experts described the deal as unusually risky for the U.S. considering Argentina's history of defaulting on loans, per a Wall Street Journal report. In reality, the deal was a loan in the form of a currency swap. The money would come from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), an account the Treasury Department can use for emergencies without congressional approval. Further, the administration said half the money would come from private lenders, not the U.S. government. After agreeing to send the initial $20 billion, Bessent said the Trump administration pledged an additional $20 billion from the "private sector," such as banks and investors, as reputable news outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, NBC News and the The Associated Press have reported. Whether Argentina actually receives the money was uncertain, as of this writing. After the Trump administration announced the aid package, Trump said his government would only help the country if the party of Argentina President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, won the country's midterm legislative election on Oct. 26. Also, it was unclear whether banks would supply their half. Snopes contacted Argentina's central bank, the U.S. Treasury Department and the White House about details in this report, and we will update our reporting if we receive responses. Argentina defaulted on its debt nine times in its history, most recently in 2001, 2014 and 2020. In December 2023, Argentina elected Milei, who outlined during his presidential campaign a libertarian program to supposedly fix the country's longstanding economic woes. Milei promised to shrink the government, cut spending and get inflation under control. Milei took office and slashed spending on infrastructure, civil servant wages and welfare, among other things. Initially, his reforms fueled optimism, which led foreign investors — including Citrone — to bet on the country's economic recovery. Milei's policies brought the country's inflation rate from 211% in 2023 to 117.8% in 2024, according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), a Spanish bank. After the economy contracted in 2023 and 2024, it grew in 2025. As of this writing, growth projections for 2025 ranged from 4% (BBVA) to 4.6% (World Bank). But economic uncertainty returned when Milei lost popularity among voters after his austerity measures resulted in a historically high poverty rate and a corruption scandal engulfed his sister, Karina Milei. As a result, his party, La Libertad Avanza, lost ground in Buenos Aires' provincial election on Sept. 7, 2025. Voters will next decide on the fate of Milei's party during the country's midterm legislative election on Oct. 26. The election results will determine Milei's ability to follow his plans for budget reform. The outcome of the Sept. 7, 2025, election triggered a panic in financial markets. Investors began selling Argentine assets, including the peso. The value of the peso dropped so sharply, the situation forced Argentina's government to sell nearly $700 million to prevent the currency from falling further. (Buying the peso with dollars helps increase its value.) That defensive move by Argentina's government depleted foreign-exchange reserves. In September 2025, the U.S. government stepped in to assist the Argentine government in its attempt to support the currency (archived): Bessent said in another post (archived) that the U.S. could help stabilize Argentina with tools such as "swap lines" and "direct currency purchases." Bessent said that "opportunities for private investments remain expansive." After Bessent's announcement, Argentine stocks soared. Weeks later, officials from the two countries met at the White House and agreed to a currency swap. In such a deal, one country uses its currency to buy the currency of another (the one that needs help). In this case, the U.S. agreed to buy pesos with dollars. The country that receives the help must buy back its currency before an agreed date. Currency swaps are loans, not gifts. On Oct. 9, Bessent announced the agreement on X, saying the Treasury had already bought pesos (archived): In that post, he said the U.S. purchased pesos directly, and that the two countries agreed to a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina's central bank. On Oct. 17, Bessent said the U.S. bought more pesos the day before, without giving a specific total. (archived): On Oct. 20, Argentina's central bank announced it had signed the deal with the U.S. The central bank's statement read: The agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for the implementation of bilateral currency swap operations between the two parties. Such operations will allow the BCRA [Banco Central de la República Argentina] to expand its set of monetary and exchange rate policy instruments, including the liquidity of its international reserves, in accordance with the regulatory functions established in its Charter. A day later, Bessent posted on X that this deal with Argentina was "a bridge to a better economic future for Argentina, not a bailout" (archived). Much was unknown about the deal, as of this writing. Neither party has shared specific terms to which they have supposedly agreed. They have not said when Argentina would have to buy back its pesos, nor have they reported the amount the U.S. has already purchased. We asked for those details in our inquiries to the Treasury Department, White House and Argentina's central bank. Money for this bailout would come from the U.S.'s ESF, which, as of August 2025, had a bit more than $43 billion available, federal records show. The U.S. government used the ESF once before to support a foreign government in trouble. That happened in 1995, when then-President Bill Clinton failed to obtain congressional approval to bail out Mexico during its peso crisis. But unlike the 2025 situation with Argentina, the U.S. did not rescue Mexico, a close trading partner, on its own. Clinton worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization of 191 countries dedicated to helping nations regain economic stability when they can't finance themselves through usual means. The IMF imposed strict conditions on Clinton's aid package to Mexico. In the case with Argentina, the Trump administration agreed to the aid package without IMF backing and did not publicly outline conditions for repayment, as of this writing. Bessent said in the Oct. 9 X post Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo promised the government would maintain strict budgetary policies, following the IMF's conditions for repaying that organization money. The IMF has been supporting Argentina for years. The organization announced in April 2025 its 23rd scheme to support the country's finances. As of this writing, the country owes the IMF $57 billion (41.8 billion in special drawing rights (SDR), the IMF's monetary unit), the highest amount any country has owed the lender. The IMF expects the countries it supports to implement policies to rebalance their budgets, often leading to austerity measures. Argentina has made similar agreements with other governments before. In 2020, Argentina arranged an $18 billion currency swap with China, $5 billion of which Argentina activated in 2024 and renewed in 2025. (That happened despite the fact Milei called China an "assassin" state during his 2023 presidential campaign.) After Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese products in 2025, China — the world's biggest importer of soybeans that, under usual conditions, buys them from the U.S. — started relying more on Argentina for the product. This angered U.S. farmers. The Trump administration saw this rapprochement between Argentina and China as a threat. Asked if he was trying to "drive a wedge" between the two countries, Trump defended the U.S.'s support of Argentina as a strategy to maintain influence in the Latin American country. During the Oct. 14 meeting between Trump and Milei, Trump said, as part of the 2025 deal, Argentina should end its currency swap agreement with China. Economic experts reportedly expressed worry over the U.S.'s risk in offering the line of credit to Argentina, especially since some believe the country should let its currency depreciate rather than let it fluctuate within a tight band against the dollar. For example, The Wall Street Journal quoted Brad Setser, a former Treasury official under former President Barack Obama, as saying, "Should the peso depreciate, which many think is not only likely but necessary, the Treasury would be left holding assets that have fallen in value," after the currency swap with Argentina. In other words, Setser said the U.S. may not recover the entirety of the loan. In the same article, The Wall Street Journal reported concerns among IMF officials that the U.S. would demand repayment of the bailout before Argentina repays the IMF the $57 billion it owes. We asked for responses to these concerns in our inquiries to the White House, Treasury Department and Argentina's central bank. Also, whether private lenders will pull through on their portion of the Trump administration's declaration to help Argentina remained unknown. On Oct. 20, The Wall Street Journal reported that banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were having difficulty finding collateral or obtaining guarantees from the U.S. government for the loan to Argentina, and that that portion of the deal may not happen as a result. Snopes contacted those four banks to independently verify The Wall Street Journal's reporting. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, and the others did not respond. Claims about wealthy investors supporting the U.S.-Argentina currency swap for their own financial gain stemmed from reports about Bessent's alleged ties to banks. Citrone, of Discovery Capital Management, was in touch with Bessent before he announced the deal, The New York Times reported, citing two anonymous sources. (Due to the anonymity of those sources, Snopes was unable to track them down for independent verification.) Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Citrone increased his investment in Argentine bonds in early September 2025, before the aid package announcement. The New York Times named investment funds the bailout package would supposedly benefit, including PIMCO, Fidelity and BlackRock, and claimed the deal would favor investor Stanley Druckenmiller's interests. He, Bessent and Citrone reportedly worked together for billionaire George Soros' investment fund, though there was no verified evidence to definitively confirm that history. Snopes reached out to these investors for confirmation. A spokesperson representing Druckenmiller said he "was not invested in Argentina at the time of Treasury intervention." Citrone's Discovery Capital declined to comment. In an interview with CNBC, Bessent dismissed the claim that the government agreed to the bailout package to help wealthy U.S. investors. The Oct. 26 midterm legislative elections in Argentina could affect the deal between the country and U.S. In the Oct. 14 meeting with Milei, Trump indiciated the U.S. would not go through with the deal if Milei's party loses on Oct. 26. "If he [Milei] does win, we're going to be very helpful," Trump said. "And if he doesn't win, we're not going to waste our time because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again." We asked the White House if Trump intends to make good on this threat. Aldaya, Francisco. "Exclusive: Rob Citrone Says Argentina Will Lead Golden Decade for Latin America."

Title: How XRP’s renewed role is driving crypto-fiat settlement and innovation worldwide

Ripple's XRP Ledger emerges as a cornerstone for blockchain payments, boasting compliance and institutional integration in major markets Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For nearly a decade, XRP has been the underdog of the digital-asset world, overshadowed by Bitcoin’s narrative dominance, Ethereum’s developer gravity, and Solana’s speed headlines. Yet while most of the market debated ETFs and exchange listings, XRP’s core network, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), kept quietly evolving in the background. It is now re-emerging as an infrastructure layer blockchain network that powers real-world payments, stablecoins, and the early wave of tokenized assets. Ripple’s long regulatory standoff ended in August 2025, closing a chapter that defined much of XRP’s last decade. A US court confirmed that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, while Ripple paid a $125 million civil penalty to settle institutional violations. With both sides dropping appeals, the decision gave Ripple the legal certainty it lacked for so many years. That clarity has allowed Ripple to secure over 40 US money-transmitter licenses, including New York, Texas, and California, granting it a nationwide footprint for crypto-fiat settlement. The effect has been immediate as XRP could finally integrate with regulated payment partners, which is something few US-linked blockchains can do. Behind those regulatory wins, the XRP Ledger itself began to show new life. Transactions tied to payment and treasury activity have risen sharply, reflecting renewed interest from financial institutions that once kept their distance. In regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, where stablecoins have become the default rail for remittances, XRPL is now positioning itself as a compliance-ready alternative to Tron and other permissionless networks. One clear example of this real-world comeback is the level of institutional adoption the blockchain enjoys globally. In September, SBI Group and Tobu Top Tours reportedly unveiled plans to issue prepaid travel tokens on the XRPL in Japan. Speaking on the importance of the move, Ripple’s Tatsuya Kohrogi noted: “This is significant as the market in Japan for prepaid payment instruments is $200 billion annually. The tokens will circulate in regional economic zones, from tourist hotspots to sports communities, driving local spending and digital innovation.” According to the Nikkei report, each token functions like a digital prepaid card, redeemable at local stores and tourism hubs. Users can top up with yen, spend instantly, and cash out without intermediaries. For a market where prepaid instruments already handle about $200 billion a year, moving those flows to XRPL represents one of the largest blockchain integrations attempted in a major economy. Essentially, the goal isn’t crypto speculation; it’s infrastructure modernization. By building on XRPL’s low-fee, high-throughput ledger, Japan is testing how digital tokens can drive cashless tourism and local commerce while fully complying with financial regulations. Another project, from Webus International, pushes XRP’s utility even further. The Singapore-based company is developing a tokenized travel-rewards exchange using XRPL’s stablecoin framework to link airline miles, hotel points, and retail loyalty credits. This market is worth nearly $100 billion worldwide. Webus plans to turn those isolated reward systems into transferable digital assets. Tokenizing balances lets consumers swap or redeem them across brands in real time, unlocking liquidity that loyalty programs have historically trapped. This also presents a subtle example of XRP’s renewed role in connecting previously closed financial systems without breaking compliance. Another clear evidence of XRPL’s growth is its growing footprint across the stablecoin and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization markets. Ripple, through its RLUSD stablecoin, is competing directly in the over $300 billion stablecoin market. While the RLUSD’s $898 million market capitalization pales in comparison to the billions of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, the digital asset has gained significant institutional usage. For context, crypto exchange Bullish recently disclosed that it used the stablecoin asset and others to settle its $1.15 billion IPO proceeds. This can be linked to RLUSD’s unique design, which prioritizes strict KYC and AML standards. Moreover, Ripple’s recent acquisition of firms like Hidden Road and Rail provides RLUSD an advantage over others, ensuring its reserves and distribution stay inside licensed channels. The compliance angle also differentiates XRPL from rival blockchain networks like Tron and Solana by embedding regulation into the network. Earlier this month, XRPL introduced the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) Standard, which allows digital asset issuers to limit transfers to verified holders through decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. That means every compliant stablecoin or tokenized asset can enforce regulatory controls directly at the protocol level, and no third-party filter is required. Martin Hiesboeck, the Head of Research at Uphold, said: “The MPT standard strategically positions the XRPL as the leading secure and compliant institutional blockchain for the future of tokenized finance.” This architecture is now attracting a mix of stablecoin issuers and financial institutions. Stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, EURØP, USDB, and XSGD all added XRPL support in 2025, signaling confidence in the network’s scalability and compliance-ready tools. Meanwhile, that vision extends well beyond stablecoins. Ripple’s roadmap positions XRPL as a base layer for RWA tokenization, which involves everything from US Treasuries to commercial credit products. This has already seen significant adoption from global authorities like Dubai and major financial institutions like Guggenheim and BlackRock. As a result, the blockchain network now ranks among the top 10 chains for RWA tokenization, handling more than $360 million in assets. Considering this level of adoption, crypto researcher Rob Cunningham concluded: “In a conservative “base case” [XRPL is] a serious corridor player and RWA registry/settlement layer; On the upside, it’s a GO-TO ledger for Stablecoin-settled cross-border Treasury and high-grade RWA settlement with MULT-TRILLION ANNUAL THROUGHPUT by 2030.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Restricting Capital Investment Is A Losing Energy Strategy
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynewinegarden/2025/10/24/restricting-capital-investment-is-a-losing-energy-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T16:29:58Z
Full Content:
ByWayne Winegarden, Contributor. The U.S. energy grid stands at a crossroads. It is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand driven in no small part by the growth of artificial intelligence and high-tech manufacturing. Simultaneously, supply is being curtailed by growing power plant retirements. It doesn’t take an advanced degree in economics to foresee the consequences. Policy makers are scrambling for answers before the inevitable power shortages and skyrocketing prices kick in. But for every potential solution that would ease the grid’s strain – keeping plants online, expediting permitting reviews and cutting bureaucratic red tape – policy actions are being taken that would damage energy industries’ ability to attract and utilize capital investment. Last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considered and then held off on changing its long standing blanket authorization policy for investment firms. The current rule requires investment firms to receive FERC approval for purchasing a utility company’s securities only when acquiring more than $10 million worth. The commission was contemplating whether this so-called blanket authorization level is too generous. Of particular concern were investment managers’ passive investment strategies – think index funds – that require these investors to continue allocate a set percentage of their assets into utilities and energy companies. Increasing the stringency of the blanket authorization would have adversely impacted the U.S. energy industry. At the time, I warned that creating “additional investment barriers” would hurt utilities’ ability “to raise the necessary capital,” hindering their ability to “expand capacity and improve the current energy infrastructure.” Thankfully the FERC agreed. As then-FERC Chairman Mark Christie wrote, while BlackRock’s environmental advocacy raises concerns, “public utilities face already large and still growing capital needs, including to fund investment in greatly needed utility assets, such as power generation.” Given these capital needs, and BlackRock’s pledge “not to use its holdings to influence utility management,” extending BlackRock’s blanket authorization will help ensure the utility sector has access to the resources it needs to continue expanding the grid’s capacity Having just dodged that bullet, a new threat to increased energy investment threatens to do the same – a lawsuit led by the Attorney General of Texas. The lawsuit alleges Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street conspired to artificially depress the coal market through anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit is a response to these investment manager’s investments in coal companies given their public support and past membership in these same environmental organizations, which are promoting policies that are detrimental to the coal industry. As I have previously argued, the asset manager’s support of these environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies is troubling and creates significant conflicts of interest between the asset managers fiduciary responsibilities and their ESG commitments. However, in practice, the AG actions will simply restrict the coal industry’s ability to raise capital – clearly contradicting the AG’s stated purpose. As the FERC decision emphasizes, prioritizing the need for an efficient allocation of capital is essential if the U.S. grid is going to deliver Americans cheap and plentiful electricity. The lawsuit also fails to account for fundamental market changes created by the fracking revolution. This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas. Relatively cheaper and lower-emission natural gas radically changed the economics of electricity generation. It is mostly thanks to relatively cheaper natural gas that coal operations have decreased across the country. In 2005, coal was the largest source for electricity, generating about 50 percent of the nation’s electricity. Natural gas generated roughly 19 percent. Over the latest 12 months, natural gas accounted for 42 percent of total generation while coal accounted for a mere 16 percent; their shares of electricity generation have swapped. This reversal of generation share was fostered by over 100 coal-fired plants that were converted to, or replaced by, natural gas-fired plants between 2011 and 2019. As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined. Although Attorney General Paxton claims to be protecting the coal industry, if the lawsuit is successful these investment firms would likely be forced to divest their holdings in the coal companies listed in the suit. This forced liquidation will deny the coal industry access to a significant source of capital. According to an analysis by the American Council for Capital Formation’s chief economist, the forced divestments would deny the collective coal industry more than $17.5 billion in capital. This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure. Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure. Cutting off investment sources – whether through FERC rule making or AG lawsuits – increases the likelihood of future blackouts and higher costs for consumers. If the goal is to promote widespread prosperity, such actions are simply the wrong policy path.

Title: The Struggle for the Future of the New York Democratic Party

Time Published: 2025-10-24T16:15:00Z
Full Content:
© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED In the final days of the NYC mayoral race, the Democratic Party faces a choice between a future defined by Zohran Mamdani or Andrew Cuomo. New York City is on the cusp of an election in which what once looked impossible has begun to seem inevitable. Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist member of the New York state Assembly, is heavily favored to beat Andrew Cuomo, New York’s onetime Democratic governor and a former icon of the party establishment, in a race for mayor that has become among the most-watched in the nation. Cuomo and Mamdani articulate two vastly different visions for New York City — and where the Democratic Party is going overall. This week on The Intercept Briefing, Akela Lacy speaks to people hoping to see each of those two visions fulfilled. “Traditionally, we’ve thought about politics as left, right, and center,” says Alyssa Cass, a Democratic strategist who has worked on local and national campaigns. “Zohran offered a message that was less about ideology and more about disrupting a failed status quo that is working for almost no one.” Cass, who worked on Andrew Yang’s mayoral campaign in 2021, isn’t working for Mamdani but says his candidacy indicates “that Democrats can win when we have ideas.” In the view of Jim Walden, a former mayoral candidate who is now backing Cuomo, those ideas are “dangerous and radical policies.” He says Mamdani’s popularity is an indication that “there’s going to be a flirtation with socialism and maybe some populist push” among Democrats. But “ultimately,” Walden says, “the party will come back closer to the center.” Chi Ossé, a City Council member who endorsed Mamdani, sees Mamdani’s success as evidence of the opposite. “We could have gone back to or continued this trend of electing centrist, moderate Democrats,” Ossé says. Instead, he thinks that New Yorkers want “someone who ran as a loud and proud democratic socialist who has always fought on the left.” While New York City is preparing for a general election, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is unlikely to win — turning the race almost into a second Democratic primary. “The party is now confronted with a choice,” says Lacy, “between a nominee who has become the new face of generational change in politics and a former governor fighting for his political comeback. The results could reveal where the party’s headed in next year’s midterms and beyond.” Listen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. Akela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing. I’m Akela Lacy. There’s less than two weeks left before New Yorkers elect their next mayor. The race has drawn national attention — both from President Donald Trump and from observers who see it as a reckoning over the future of the Democratic Party. PIX11 News: Zohran Mamdani continues to hold an insurmountable lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the race for New York City mayor, as long as Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa stays in it. AL: Even though New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani decisively won the Democratic primary in June, the general election has pretty much boiled down to a contest between two candidates trying to claim the Democratic mantle. There’s Mamdani — the party’s nominee — and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations that he now denies and has been chasing the mayoralty as his political comeback. Since he lost the primary, Cuomo’s running on an independent ballot line called “Fight and Deliver,” but he’s still pitching himself as a Democrat. There’s also Curtis Sliwa — the founder of the Guardian Angels, Republican candidate, and a thorn in the side of those who want him out of the race to clear a lane on the right for Cuomo. That’s the position of billionaires like John Catsimatidis and Bill Ackman, who have been pushing to get Sliwa out. Curtis Sliwa: Come on Ackman, stay in your lane. Does he know anything about politics? No. Does he live in New York City? No. He lives in Chappaqua, the whitest suburb of America, where even the lawn jockeys are white. AL: It’s also the position of President Trump. Donald Trump: We don’t need a communist in this country. But if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him very carefully, on behalf of the nation. AL: The Trump administration already got its wish when current New York City Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race last month, and the conventional wisdom was that many Adams supporters would flock to Cuomo. But after a federal corruption indictment that disappeared when Trump swept into office — remember that? — Adams’s support was already plummeting. And with Sliwa unlikely to become mayor himself, the race is really seen as a contest between Mamdani and Cuomo. Now, Mamdani and Cuomo represent two possible paths the Democratic Party could take: a democratic socialist who was once deemed too far to the left to pull off a primary and is now heavily favored to win the general versus a former Democratic governor who can count the Republican president in his camp. What does the saga say about the state of Democratic politics across the nation? That question is facing Democrats at a time when the national party is still finding itself after a crushing loss that returned Donald Trump to the White House. Two years before that, a humiliating performance in the 2022 midterms threw the New York state Democratic Party into crisis, when Democrats in the state lost congressional seats and helped hand Republicans control of the House of Representatives. In the state that gave us both insurgent leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the two top Democrats in Congress — Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries — the party is now confronted with a choice between a nominee who has become the new face of generational change in politics and a former governor fighting for his political comeback. The results could reveal where the party’s headed in next year’s midterms and beyond. So today, we’re going to talk to people hoping to see each of those two visions fulfilled. First, we’ll hear from a City Council member backing Mamdani and a Democratic strategist who’s been following the race but isn’t working for any campaign. And after the break, we’ll hear from a former mayoral candidate who dropped out and endorsed Cuomo, saying he doesn’t want to see the Democratic Party veer toward socialism. Joining me now is Chi Ossé. He’s the Council Member for New York City’s 36th District. He endorsed Mamdani in April. Welcome to the show, Council Member Ossé. Chi Ossé: Thank you so much for having me on. AL: Also joining us is Alyssa Cass, a Democratic media strategist based in New York City and partner at Slingshot Strategies. She served as an adviser to top elected officials, candidates, and causes at the national, state, and local levels. Welcome to the show, Alyssa. Alyssa Cass: Hi. It is so good to be here. AL: We’re speaking on Wednesday, October 22nd. [Editor’s note: On October 24, Politico reported that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will be endorsing Zohran Mamdani.] And just a note, we are not endorsing any candidate on this podcast, and we’re focusing on the pressures building both locally and nationally on the Democratic party. To start, especially for our listeners outside of New York, why has Mamdani’s campaign become a national story? You have Fox News running wall-to-wall coverage, Trump calling to deport him — what exactly is bringing so much national attention to this race? Chi, we’ll start with you. CO: Absolutely. Well, first and foremost, I believe that it’s one of the biggest races that we’re seeing post-November of 2024. And after Republicans secured levels within Congress as well as the presidency, people are looking at the Democratic Party and seeing how we respond to that especially within the New York City mayoral race. You know, we could have gone two ways. We could have gone back to or continued this trend of electing centrist, moderate Democrats — or we could have gone with Zohran Mamdani, someone who ran as a loud and proud democratic socialist who has always fought on the left, who speaks up about Palestinian rights and sovereignty. And this race showed that the party is accepting and willing to move to the left. Zohran ran a very creative, loud race that was centered around affordability and did so without being tied to the financial institutions and entities that usually elect our mayors here within New York City. And made a lot of noise during the campaign, galvanized a lot of people, and made some history in terms of how the campaign was run. So with all of that, it made this a historic race, one that has caught the ears of many and has skyrocketed Zohran into the place where he is today. AL: Alyssa, I want to bring you in. I mean, you worked on the 2021 mayoral race, you’ve worked on national races. What’s your perspective on what is making this resonate with people outside of New York or have the potential ramifications that go beyond the city? AC: I think about that question in kind of two primary buckets. The first is, why is this so interesting? One is, I think that it offers us a view of politics and the contours of politics that’s actually more realistic or how actual people think about it. Traditionally, we’ve thought about politics as left, right, and center. And I think that the major fault line in politics now, or how people think about it, is that the status quo is not working for almost anyone. “He fundamentally reconstituted the electorate. … He was able to put together a coalition of, frankly, almost everyone, just other than the very wealthy.” And if we don’t reform the status quo, we are going to break it. And Zohran offered a message that was less about ideology and more about disrupting a failed status quo that is working for almost no one. And that approach to the race offers Democrats a really powerful path forward. And as we think about how do we reconstitute winning coalitions — and that’s something I think has been a little under appreciated about Zohran’s win — he fundamentally reconstituted the electorate. If you live in New York City — if you are working class, middle class, or even upper middle class — New York City is not working for you. If you are anyone who interacts with public services on a daily basis, if you’re sending your kid to public school, if you’re taking the bus, if you’re riding the subway, New York City life is really like — hard. AL: You can say the f-word, it’s OK. AC: It’s really fucking hard. And he was able to put together a coalition of, frankly, almost everyone, just other than the very wealthy. And frankly offer an optimistic view of politics that brought us together about what unites us: that no one’s having an easy time. Obviously there are different degrees to that, but these parallel crises of affordability for almost every American tapping into that is the path forward for anyone who wants to win. And I think that those two reasons: of one, seeing the electorate not in these ideological terms that I think mostly people like us think about, but normal people don’t, and the ability to rebuild a democratic coalition, is exactly what people are talking about, and it’s not done through, like, big focus groups about what men are thinking or what words we’re saying, but how to build a coalition of people for whom the status quo isn’t working, which is almost everyone. AL: We’re speaking on the morning after a shocking immigration raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown where federal agents arrested multiple people. New York has sanctuary city laws that forbid cops and other local officials from coordinating with federal immigration enforcement. And as of this recording, Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD say the city had nothing to do with the raid. Both Cuomo and Mamdani have put out statements condemning the raid. But more specifically in a moment like this, how should a New York City mayor respond? Chi, start with you. CO: Absolutely. Well, I don’t believe a word that comes out of Eric Adams’s mouth. And he is an accomplice if not a lapdog to Donald Trump. So in terms of the statements that were shared, I do not believe him. A mayor, and hopefully the next mayor, will uphold our sanctuary laws and also work with the NYPD and use his authority to make sure that all people who live here in New York City are protected regardless of their immigration status when it comes to federal agents infringing on the rights of the land here in New York. AC: Yeah, I think something we saw last night, but we’ve seen kind of throughout the past few months, are reminders of, is that Donald Trump is coming for New York City regardless. And what New Yorkers want is not someone who is promising to work with Trump, or can manage Trump, or who has a history of negotiating with Trump. That we’re actually seeing that like that doesn’t matter. “What New Yorkers want is not someone who is promising to work with Trump, or can manage Trump, or who has a history of negotiating with Trump.” We really need someone who is principled, incredibly disciplined in saying, “Donald Trump, hands off New York.” And we’ve actually seen this dynamic, I think, play out in a really interesting way throughout this general election. I think that you saw, at the end of the primary, you saw Cuomo beginning to try to socialize with New Yorkers. “If Donald Trump’s coming after New York, you want someone who can give him a call and talk him down.” We’re seeing that like that’s not possible, was never possible. There was so much coverage about New York City’s shift to the right, the increase in New York City voters who voted for Trump. They were voting for Trump, I think what we’re seeing now is not because they wanted ICE raids that destroy communities, destroy our economies, and rip our New York City neighbors from their schools and their homes — they wanted someone who was listening. So the best way to actually fight Trump and to rebuild a Democratic Party is not through compromise, but really through a pursuit of our principles and our values. AL: And I want to draw this out to the national level too, because this is extremely parallel with the criticisms, you know, facing national Democrats — Chuck Schumer, et cetera, Hakeem Jeffries in Congress — and this idea that at the beginning of Trump’s term, national Democrats really were sitting back and saying, “Is there a world in which we can play nice with Trump and have some leverage, some negotiating, leverage some power? Something to bring to the table.” And it quickly became obvious that that wasn’t going to work. But also that was extremely infuriating to voters. And I think that’s why you’re seeing Democrats pivot with this shutdown strategy. Whereas back in March, they were saying, let’s try to work with Republicans where we can. But I think what you’re saying, Alyssa, is that that is not something that voters have the patience for anymore. And I think that’s not just a New York City thing, that’s a national thing. AC: Yeah. I think part of why Donald Trump won or why you’ve seen Democrats struggle is that when the status quo isn’t working, bad ideas beat no ideas. And we’ve often been the party and had candidates that are “no ideas.” And what we are seeing is that Democrats can win when we have ideas. Zohran is a case study of that. So when trying to manage or handle Trump, the idea isn’t to go along or get along. That’s a “no idea.” “When the status quo isn’t working, bad ideas beat no ideas. … What we are seeing is that Democrats can win when we have ideas. Zohran is a case study of that.” We need new ideas and preparedness. I think one of the biggest tasks of the future mayor is getting prepared for an escalation in the assault on New York City. We know he’s coming. I think we have every reason to expect National Guard or federal troops and making sure we’re prepared, right? Making sure we are setting the rules of the road with NYPD and other agencies and cooperating with that sort of incursion. And that will be like day one after the general election, the real work of the mayor-elect. AL: Chi, do you want to add anything on the tail end of that? CO: I absolutely agree with Alyssa’s point. I also do want to note that on the topic of national Democrats and them wanting to work with Trump and at least see if there’s a middle ground — Trump doesn’t give a fuck, right? And his whole modem operandi is to embarrass Democrats and has been doing so both with Chuck and Hakeem. In addition to that, our leadership in the Democratic Party somewhat ushered this type of behavior in. Back when Mahmoud Khalil was disappeared right here in the city, both of those individuals were very quiet, if not timid, on making statements and being very loud about their statements in the disappearing of people and disappearing of Mahmoud Khalil. They kind of set the precedent for this to happen, especially here in this city. So to have a mayor-elect and future mayor who’s going to speak truth to power and stand on business when it comes to how evil ICE is, right? And call-out how un-American and Gestapo-like that ICE is, is going to be something that I believe will resound with New Yorkers. And that New Yorkers want to see their elected officials, their mayor, their Democrats fighting for, right? AL: So jumping back in time a little bit, shortly after the primary, there was a ton of reporting on how New York’s wealthiest business leaders were working to defeat Mamdani, including offering to help Adams find a private sector job if he dropped out. One of the city’s biggest real estate developers was floated as an option at one point. But last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he would support Mamdani if he won. What’s your reaction to that? If Mamdani wins, Alyssa, what sorts of roadblocks can he expect from the city’s elite? AC: Mamdani’s done a lot of work to assuage and do a charm campaign with the business community. AL: Right. AC: Not because he’s going to betray his agenda, but because it’s a savvy observation that they’re actually pretty easy to pacify, right? And is avoiding, I think, some of the missteps that Bill de Blasio did. Bill de Blasio got pretty beat up immediately by the business community. But the business community is actually easy to charm, right? The thing that they care about the most, that most materially impacts them — like, let’s say raising taxes — a mayor of New York City actually doesn’t have much, doesn’t have any control over. So when it comes to the business community, I think that a little bit of engaging, showing that you’ll pick up their calls — which Bill de Blasio was unwilling to do — goes a long way. And that ultimately, the mayor of New York City is not materially impacting these people who are really out for themselves. And that actually creates an environment where [it’s] easy to give them a little face-time and then I think they shut up. AL: To your point, you said he’s meeting with these people not because he is going to betray his agenda, but that is what some people are concerned about. AC: I think you want to like — Listen, being mayor is really fucking hard, and you have a very limited runway before everyone is going to start shitting on you and be very critical. And it’s hard to implement your agenda. Clearing the decks from a chorus of haters or trying to lessen them a bit is not kowtowing. It’s just paving the way for an easier time, because there are going to be actual crises to deal with. So I think it’s clearing a smoother runway for when you’re actually sworn in. And there’s so much out of your control — like there could be a snowstorm that becomes a disaster — that you want to clear the decks, shut up the haters by dishing out a little sugar. That’s savvy, not being compromised. AL: I want to put this to both of you. How can we expect those same people to react to a Cuomo win? Chi, we’ll start with you. CO: The business people? AL: Yeah. And you know, the elite of of New York, the people who, you know, originally were partnering with Bill Ackman to try to figure out how to— CO: Yeah. I mean, I think they want Cuomo to win, obviously. I do believe that a majority of the elite want Cuomo to win. I think it’s more about what Zohran means for politics, right? He was able to win without the backing and being tethered again to these financial institutions. And many of these elite folks want elected officials that they can control. And if someone can win as mayor of New York City without being tethered to their power, what could that mean for city council, state Assembly, state Senate, and even some of our congressional seats? “If someone can win as mayor of New York City without being tethered to their power, what could that mean for city council, state Assembly, state Senate, and even some of our congressional seats?” AC: Yeah. And like, here’s my thing through all of this, when Bill Ackman throws a temper tantrum, or John Catsimatidis, which I think that’s the right pronunciation, throws a temper tantrum, I think people see that and it moves people toward Zohran. Like, wasn’t the whole point of Zohran’s election is that people are sick and tired of people like Bill Ackman paying little in taxes and having a massive apartment and having the influence that they do, right? Like that status quo that these people are screaming about that Zohran is going to disrupt is the very thing people don’t like. So yeah, I’m sure they’re going to have a meltdown. And they are welcome to move to Boca, and we will be thrilled to convert their brownstones and mega penthouses into multifamily dwellings to further make a dent in our housing crisis. AL: Going back to Cuomo. I know that some members, some city council members, were stripped from their roles in budget negotiations after backing Cuomo. Chi, what is the mood toward Cuomo among city councilors right now? CO: There’s a higher definite chance that Zohran becomes the next mayor, and regardless of where people fall within that politically ideological spectrum, I think people do want to be on good terms with the mayor, right? So I do think that there has been a vast distancing from Andrew Cuomo. AC: And the councilman makes a great point. And I think that is revealing of a bigger dynamic that I think is worth pointing out. People who are really watching New York politics are like, this is not like a real race, right? It is being treated as a very competitive general election for reasons that are divorced from the mechanics and the central dynamics of the race. Zohran had a winning message and a winning coalition, and Andrew Cuomo did not. None of those dynamics have changed. And you see the rest of the political class in New York very much understanding that. And we are thrilled for the attention and continue to go along with the ruse that Andrew Cuomo would like us to believe that this is still a competitive election and that he somehow has a path, but he does not. “We are thrilled for the attention and continue to go along with the ruse that Andrew Cuomo would like us to believe that this is still a competitive election and that he somehow has a path, but he does not.” AL: So far, only five Democrats representing New York City in Congress have endorsed Mamdani, the party’s nominee: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nydia Velázquez, who both endorsed him before he won the primary; Adriano Espaillat, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke, who endorsed him after he won. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James got on board. Notably absent are Democrats’ top two leaders in Congress — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of whom have addressed this in the last week or so and said they are still planning to weigh in. [Editor’s note: On October 24, Politico reported that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will be endorsing Zohran Mamdani.] Many other Democrats have backed Cuomo, others whose candidates lost in the primary haven’t endorsed anyone else. What’s happening here? Are there two Democratic Parties? AC: So what is happening here is that the leaders, the elected leaders of the Democratic Party look so fucking stupid, I’m sorry. Honestly, it would’ve been better for them to just like, never endorse him and say like, “I’m just not going to make an endorsement in this race. I didn’t in the primary,” and like, move the fuck on. This is really the worst of both worlds. And just the message it sends. You hear from both of those leaders that we are a big-tent party, but apparently not so big if you have certain concerns about certain issues. The biggest discomfort with Zohran seems to be around foreign policy issues that have nothing to do with fucking New York City and also are so out of the mainstream of where the median Democratic voter is in New York City or beyond, it further reveals that there is a gap between the people who are calling all of the shots and regular voters. It only serves to put them, to make them seem more out of touch and more beholden not to rank-and-file Democrats but something else. AL: Chi, do you want to add anything? CO: Sure, yeah. Their donors won’t let them. AL: Who? Which donors? Who are we talking about? CO: All of them. AL: Can you say more? CO: Yeah. Probably BlackRock, the largest landlord in this country, probably AIPAC. Yeah, I think those donors will not let them endorse Zohran Mamdani for mayor. AC: Those sorts of donors give way more money at this point to the Republican Party and to Republican elected officials. Like, we are getting very little out of this. It shows a very — a view of politics and where to get money that is really out of date. CO: Yeah. It’s the same donors that don’t let them fight against Donald Trump, right? AL: Alyssa, you brought up the foreign policy thing, and Chi, you’re mentioning AIPAC too. Mamdani has also faced criticism from his left and much on his right, particularly on this Israel–Gaza issue. Last week, he was asked during the mayoral debate about the ongoing saga around this phrase Mamdani himself has never used — “globalize the intifada” — but which many Democrats and pro-Israel critics have urged him to denounce. This is a phrase that many pro-Palestine advocates say simply calls for the end of the Israeli occupation – “intifada” is an Arabic word meaning uprising or resistance. But many pro-Israel Mamdani critics have turned it into a political cudgel to spread this fear that Mamdani won’t keep Jewish New Yorkers safe. I wrote about this last week, and you can find the story at The Intercept. Mamdani has drawn criticism for similar comments, including that he threw the movement for Palestine under the bus or that he’s a Zionist. Is there a “right” way for Dems to play this? Chi, I’ll start with you. CO: I don’t necessarily see it as a right way for Democrats to play this. I think Mamdani has 38 percent of support from the Jewish vote to Andrew Cuomo’s 42 percent. That’s basically equally matched. I believe for this issue, this is something that Jewish voters are definitely taking a look at, and a sizable amount support Mamdani and his efforts. AL: Alyssa, is there a right way for Democrats to play this issue? AC: So it seems to me that his approach of not ever endorsing or supporting the flattening of Gaza was the right approach. This is an issue where you will never please everyone, but the majority of Jewish Democratic voters believe there there’s a genocide that’s been happening in the Middle East. AL: Right. “What is popular and what is morally righteous are the same position right now.” AC: Are uncomfortable with the current no-strings-attached relationship with a radical right-wing Israeli government. And to me, when you’re looking at where’s the right place to be, I’m not sure it’s that hard. Because what is popular and what is morally righteous are the same position right now. AL: I’m going to switch gears a little bit and go back to early this year, January, February. It’s cold out. The mayoral race is just beginning. Everyone’s wondering if Eric Adams will even run again because he’s still under indictment. There are whispers about Cuomo, the assumption is that if he does jump in, everyone else might as well pack it up and go home. Why was he considered such a shoe-in? CO: Cuomo did a really good job at creating this paper tiger effect on the political establishment. And it was very unclear as to what was going to happen within this mayoral race, especially with the amount of candidates that were jumping in and was able to secure some union endorsements from the get-go. There is this notion within our prior understanding of the New York City electorate, that a lot of voters who turn out in these elections — usual voters who turn out in these elections — will vote for the name that they know. And, you know, Andrew Cuomo was a name for older Black voters and Latino voters and outer borough voters, which was a strategy that Eric Adams used to win in 2021. So it created this effect that really galvanized a lot of the New York City press corp as well, right, political press corp to aid in Cuomo’s efforts of making him seem as unstoppable as he appeared. What was not taken into account was — and frankly could not be taken into account — was the movement that Zohran and New York City DSA were able to put together. It energized thousands, tens of thousands of new voters, folks who usually don’t come out and vote in New York City mayoral races. AC: Actually, when I look back, Zohran ran the most big-D Democratic campaign of any of the candidates in the primary. While many of us political consultants had our heads up our own asses, myself included, feeling very fearful, seeing the red wave that had happened in New York City and thinking — We forgot that this is a deeply Democratic town, and a liberal or progressive one at that. “We forgot that this is a deeply Democratic town, and a liberal or progressive one at that.” While the rest of the field was modulating on public safety or bringing in a more moderate tone to everything those campaigns were doing, Zohran ran a proud Democratic campaign, about making this city work for New Yorkers that was definitely democratic and the best sense of what being a classic Democrat was. And also understood — like they did something so well, but it was a very basic premise — that talking all of the time about the thing that people are thinking about and are keeping [them] up at night and are telling people is their number one concern is smart. The basic concept was not rocket science. And everyone else overcomplicating shit, created a real pathway for an insurgent candidate like Mamdani. AL: Thank you Council Member Chi Ossé and Democratic strategist Alyssa Cass, we really appreciate you joining us on the Intercept Briefing. CO: Thank you so much for having us. AC: Thank you. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. [Break] AL: We’re continuing the conversation about how the New York City mayoral race is shaping the future of the Democratic Party with Attorney Jim Walden. He’s endorsing Andrew Cuomo. Walden was running his own independent bid until early September, when he dropped out. His name will still be on the ballot in November — but he says he doesn’t want it there. Jim, welcome to The Intercept Briefing. Jim Walden: Thank you Akela. Thanks for having me. AL: We’re speaking to Jim on Thursday morning So we have been talking about the future of the Democratic Party. There’s been a lot of discussion in this past year since Kamala Harris lost the presidential election about a desire for a fresh start in the party. How does Cuomo fit into that future? JW: To the extent that the future of the Democratic [Party] as there’s a socialist future in there, I don’t think that Andrew Cuomo would ever be pushed that far. At the end of the day, he is a free market guy. He believes in the private sector. He believes that it’s critical for building, which is so important to the future of New York City. And so I think that it’ll be super interesting from the perspective of someone who’s been a long time independent to see across the country and in particular in New York, where the party goes. My guess is that there’s going to be a flirtation with socialism and maybe some populist push but that ultimately the party will come back closer to the center. AL: What are the policies that he’s running on right now that you see as emblematic of his potential to step into this leadership role at a critical moment in Democratic politics? JW: Housing in New York City, I can’t stress this enough, is central to solving the affordability crisis. And just today there was a number of press reports that came out that talked about the fact that the market for rent-stabilized housing, which represents about a million units across the city, that landlords are in financial distress and 1 in 5 buildings is underwater and they’re delaying things like repairs. And that is having a very, very significant impact on particularly Black and brown tenants who make up a significant portion of the rent-stabilized portfolio. “Andrew Cuomo is someone that has very close relationships with developers. He’s taken a lot of flack for that.” So Andrew Cuomo is someone that has very close relationships with developers. He’s taken a lot of flack for that. But you know, when you have a fire, you’re calling firefighters. When you have a criminal running down the street, you call the cops. We have a housing crisis that if we can’t solve it, it’s going to have collateral consequences across our economy. AL: So when you were running for mayor, you pitched yourself as the business community candidate, a reasonable moderate who knows how to work with the city’s elites and navigate the complexities of city government. And also as an outsider, who was someone who wasn’t a technocrat, someone who could appeal to some of the frustrations I think that people have had with the Democratic Party. What do you say to critics who might argue that the city’s billionaires are the people who most want Cuomo to win, and that this is a strategy to maintain the status quo? JW: That is an incredibly important question. And let me just double down in a show of self-awareness. I’ve said quite clearly that Andrew Cuomo getting into the race was one of the reasons that I decided to run because I thought that we needed change and we needed new leadership. So I’m not running away from any of my prior positions. Unfortunately, we have the candidates that we have, and I’ve said as clearly as I can that I think that they are all challenged candidates for different reasons, whether it’s experience, whether or not prior scandals and the like, but it was an uncomfortable choice that I had to make. But I made that choice, Akela, a long time ago. But it is actually really surprising to me that [Mamdani] has taken off the way that he has. And as I saw him ascend, I was actually one of the first people that predicted— I had run a whole Monte Carlo simulation before the Democratic primary in four of the 10 simulations, Mamdani won, and those were predictably accurate. And as I saw him rise, I saw him in some ways embrace more what I think are, you know, dangerous and radical policies. “They are all challenged candidates for different reasons, whether it’s experience, whether or not prior scandals and the like, but it was an uncomfortable choice that I had to make.” Akela Lacy: Yeah. So I want to go back to this idea of the status quo because — and I hear what you’re saying about your calculation both in jumping into the race and then removing yourself from the race because of the writing that you saw on the wall. But do you see Cuomo as a potential extension of that status quo? And if not, can you explain why not? Jim Walden: Status quo is, maybe we can sharpen that a little by saying that he’s an institutionalist, right? So I believe that it’s fair to say that, I’ll speak about me. I’m an institutionalist in the sense that for 23 years I’ve been bringing pro bono cases attacking city, state, and federal government for a lot of bad things that they’ve done to people. That doesn’t mean that I don’t support the institutions of democracy and our government. I do. And I believe that Andrew Cuomo is very much of the same ilk, although he may be more of an institutionalist because he’s been part of the governing elite, if you will. But at the same time I think that he will talk about changing the status quo, I think he’s going to change the status to quote completely when it comes to housing. I know for sure that his plan is — and again, to be clear, I’m not in the Cuomo campaign. I did this as a matter of my own personal politics and my own belief in what was the best for the city. I know that he’s going to do everything he could possibly do to start building things right away. And that’s what we need. I mean, if you think about the most recent data on housing, right? 2024 is the most complete picture that we have. Mayor Adams, to his credit, oversaw the building of about 25,000 rent-stabilized apartments. That’s great. That’s that’s a big bump from where we’ve been. The problem is that we lost 11,000 of older units that were being warehoused. And so 25,000 come on, 11,000 go off. We need somewhere between, depending on whose estimate you look at — My best estimate was 50,000 rent-stabilized units a year. Zohran Mamdani plan is only going to build 20,000 rent-stabilized apartments a year if it works. That’s something where I do trust Cuomo. AL: We have some breaking news as we’re speaking. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is endorsing Cuomo for mayor after joining him courtside at the Knicks game on Wednesday night. Can we get your reaction to that, Jim? JW: Yeah. So Adams endorsing Cuomo is really no surprise. You know, this kind of is a testament to again, all of the ways in which our political system is broken and in some ways dysfunctional. Eric Adams, whatever it was a month ago, said that Andrew Cuomo was a snake and a liar, and then they’re sitting at the Knicks game together, and then there’s an endorsement the next day. You know, I think that those sorts of things turn off people. They turn off voters. How can you have a positive reaction to that? “Those sorts of things turn off people. They turn off voters. How can you have a positive reaction to that?” But at the same time politics is politics, and at the end of the day it comes down to numbers. And with Cuomo and Sliwa in the race, Mamdani’s got a huge advantage. Just the math is the math. I mean, I’ve said this a million times and I don’t know how many people are listening to me on it. AL: You mentioned Adam doing this turn toward Cuomo after calling him a snake, but you had similar words for Cuomo in May. You described him as “a tired snake oil salesman, who’s on his last leg.” What is it about his policies that have made you change your mind? JW: So Cuomo while, I have deep, deep disagreements with him on a number of the things that have happened during the course of his career. He is a person that we need right now. Why? If you look at any projection — it doesn’t matter whether it’s inside the government or outside the government, unless some amazing, wonderful thing happens to the city — the minimum deficit that we’re going to have next year is $5 billion. And some of the estimates go up to something like nine, just next year. In the two years after that — again, unless there’s some sort of magic ointment that someone applies to our business community — the deficits are going to get much higher. And in that environment when we need so much, and we are already in a distressed situation with tax revenue, there’s going to have to be bold moves that pay the bills for all the things that we need to do. And Zohran Mamdani, he has said more times than I can count that he wants to dismantle or defund the police. And then he’s running on a platform that he says “I’m not trying to defund the police,” but he is trying to defund the police. And this is one of the things that’s so frustrating to see low-information voters bite on this hook. Which is, he’s saying he’s going to keep the current level of police the same. We are down — depending on whose estimate you want to look at — the range is somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 cops. No one’s really looking at the rate at which senior officers and detectives are filing for early retirement. “ We need more cops. And he’s not being honest about the fact that he really is defunding the police by holding the current headcount.” And there hasn’t been an enormous push to recruit. I think that at the end of the day, at the end of the year, if we end up flat, I think we’ll be lucky. But we need more cops. And he’s not being honest about the fact that he really is defunding the police by holding the current headcount. And earlier when he was describing his community, his department of community safety, I was standing next to him at a full mayoral forum where he said he was going to fund that by taking $1 billion out of the NYPD overtime budget. I was standing right there. And then when he put the PRO plan out, maybe after getting some initial criticism and feedback, he claims that he’s going to pay for it by raising taxes, both corporate and individual. So I believe that he wants to defund the police, and I believe everything that he’s been saying for years about his perspective on NYPD, you know, he said he was going to apologize. He then pivoted and said, well, I’m going to do it privately with individual officers. I’m not going to issue a blanket apology. You know, I have a lot of cops who are friends and I can’t tell you the number of times, Akela, that cops have said to me, “Listen, if he’s going to be mayor and he’s going to change the CCRB, so the police commissioner has no power over choosing discipline for officers, I’m out of here.” So and those are two of the key reasons that cops are leaving the city is because the CCRB, it always was a broken agency. I had planned to get rid of it with something that was much more effective in terms of getting at the bad apples in NYPD and not victimizing cops that were trying to do their jobs and got into bad situations that they tried their best to control, but still had a complaint filed against them. So the CCRB, the extent to which they’re now being forced into overtime shifts that are akin to a indentured servitude at times, and lower starting salaries than is being competitive with other states outside of New York. That’s why we’re losing active-duty officers because it’s like, I don’t need this anymore. So that’s one example of a policy that I think is dangerous.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Title: Judgment against three ‘dodgy box’ operators who may have to pay hundreds of thousands to Sky

Three people involved in selling “dodgy boxes” – which are used to illegally access TV streaming services – have been found liable by the High Court to pay possibly hundreds of thousands of euro which Sky says it has lost from their activities. Mr Justice Liam Kennedy granted judgment, in two separate cases, against the three to Sky UK Ltd which provides TV services in the UK and Ireland. The three, who failed to appear in court, are Andrew Keena of Mariner’s Court, Blackrock, Co Louth, and Stephen McBride and Carol Thornton, both of Defenders Row, Dundalk, Co Louth. The judge also granted permanent injunctions that they cease all copyright-infringing activities and not to continue to make the material available on their infringing services. They are also prohibited from taking, directly or indirectly, steps to transfer or give away any source code or other technology related to their infringing services and to cease all advertising of the services. The court will assess damages at a future date. An investigator employed by Sky Subscriber Services Ltd said in affidavits that the estimated annual loss from Mr Keena’s activities was conservatively put at €643,860 based on Sky’s average revenue per month of €73 per customer. Mr Keena is estimated to have had 735 customers paying an entity called “Interstellar Media” €95 per year, bringing in €69,825. The number of customers was based on members of a Facebook group set up for the purpose of providing information about the use of Interstellar Media. However, the investigator said in one Facebook post, in June 2021 during the UEFA Euro football tournament, it was stated there were “over 4,856 customers”. Interstellar Media was notable among infringers in that it used its own branded application to provide its services via downloads for internet protocol TV (IPTV) firesticks, computers and other devices, the investigator said. Most IPTV service providers use generic applications to stream their services. [ Confessions of a dodgy box owner: ‘It did give me pause for thought but the savings are incredible’Opens in new window ] Mr McBride and Ms Thornton charged a “competitive” €70 per year for their service, the investigator said. Infringing IPTV subscriptions regularly sell for €100 plus per year, he added. In the McBride/Thornton case, the investigator estimated an annual loss to Sky of €876,000. Mr McBride boasted of selling to more than 1,000, which meant a revenue for them of more than €70,000. The McBride/Thornton service involved customers downloading an application called “Dreambox Android XMBC” to an Amazon Firestick which provided Sky Entertainment, Sky Sports and Sky Cinema, among other channels. Mr McBride also sent an instructional video to customers on how to install and use the service. All three defendants advertised through Facebook while the McBride/Thornton service was also on Instagram using slogans like “Sick of paying ridiculous Sky bills” and “No more stupid Sky bills”. When “cease and desist” letters were sent by Sky’s lawyers to all three, Mr Keena said Interstellar Media was no longer in operation since around November 2021. He also claimed that his PayPal account, which received payments for Interstellar Media, had been used without his knowledge by a third party. He refused to name the third party. The investigator said Mr Keena also has an apparent connection with another infringing IPTV service called Showbiz Media and this means his infringing activities are not just limited to Interstellar Media. Interstellar was a very sophisticated service operating at scale and Mr Keena had been “very evasive and dishonest in his limited engagements” with Sky, he said. When Mr McBride received a cease and desist letter, he replied in April 2022 saying “Excuse me?. Is this spam or a joke?” The investigator said, at his request, Mr McBride’s Facebook profile was removed. But he created two new profiles, one in his own name and other called “Firesticks Dundalk”. [ The Irish Times view on dodgy boxes: enforce the lawOpens in new window ] In and around mid-2023, when Sky first commence legal proceedings against him and Ms Thornton, the infringing services ceased. The defendants, who have not otherwise engaged with the proceedings against them, will have an opportunity to turn up in court when the assessment of damages is being carried out.

Title: Trump Wrecks America. His “Patriotic” Fans Cheer. Is There Any Bottom?

Time Published: 2025-10-24T14:40:04Z

I was going to write one more liberal column expressing outrage about what Donald Trump has done to the White House this week, but then I thought: Why? What would be the point? The people who would agree with me would agree with me, and the people who wouldn’t wouldn’t, and the world would go on its merry way. Of course the president’s destruction of the East Wing is beyond outrageous. It’s completely illegal and un-American—not just un-American, but anti-American: the unilateral, I-don’t-give-a-fuck desecration of a civic shrine that belonged to all the people. Democracies have appointed bodies that oversee such things. Dictators, actual and aspiring, ignore all that. Call it overreaction if you must, but I’m sure I’m hardly the only American to google “Albert Speer Germania” this week. And yet, it’s probably only the third-most-outrageous thing Trump has done since Monday. To place, in horse-racing parlance, I’d put the pardon of Changpeng Zhao, who “invested” in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency start-up and who pleaded guilty in 2023 to allowing his Binance crypto exchange to be used—get this now, and imagine a Democrat issuing a pardon to such a person—by, among other unsavories, Hamas’s military wing (not just plain old Hamas—its military wing!). And taking the gold medal this week would be the $230 million extortion that the sitting president of the United States demanded from the Department of Justice. (I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence.) A Pahlavi-level tacky ballroom can always be torn down; these other corrupt precedents cannot be undone. No—one more outraged liberal column won’t add much this week. The more interesting thing I’ve been thinking about lately is not the leader who perpetrates these acts but the people who allow them and cheer them. Because this is the truly maddening question, from a small-d democratic perspective. Authoritarian-fascist demagogues come along sometimes; that’s the world. But democratic societies stop them. Why hasn’t ours stopped Trump? We are cursed with four categories of fascism enablers. The interesting question about each group is not merely what they are doing, but why: What motivates them? Let’s go through them. First, obviously, are the Republicans in Congress and on the Supreme Court. Call them 1a and 1b, because I believe they have different motivations. The Republicans in the House and the Senate are mostly just tiny cowards who fear Trump, a possible primary challenger from the right, and most of all the MAGA base. The video clips that I hope they play over and over in future high school civics classes, assuming these thugs can’t fully erase our democracy, will be the ones of GOP legislators scurrying for the elevators as they deny having knowledge of Trump’s latest assault. Against stern competition, House Speaker Mike Johnson, the tiniest coward of them all, is the most pathetic exemplar of this: “I’m not gonna comment on something I haven’t read, so I’m not sure what you’re talking about,” he told reporters this week when they asked him about the DOJ bribe. The six conservatives on the Supreme Court, in contrast, aren’t cowards. They know what they’re doing, and they have no voters to fear. We must assume that they are consciously creating the America they want. That’s most true of the two deepest reactionaries, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. But to varying degrees, it’s true of the other four conservatives, John Roberts very much included. The record they are leaving behind of these terse, barely explained pro-Trump shadow docket decisions will be their legacy—of shame, if we manage to restore democracy after Trump, or of glory, if we descend into a Hunger Games society. Group two consists of the cowards in the corporate and business worlds who surely know on some level that Trump is dangerous. But they stay silent, for, I think, one of two reasons, or some combination thereof. One, they fear Trumpian retribution. Two, they want their taxes cut. Have a gander at this list of donors to Trump’s razing of the East Wing for his ballroom. Talk about a basket of deplorables. Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone. The Fanjul brothers, the megarich sugar magnates and welfare queens. Meta (Mark Zuckerberg). Amazon (Jeff Bezos). Palantir (Peter Thiel). Others are less blatantly offensive but obviously covering their corporate behinds. These are not by and large stupid people. On some level, they see what Trump is doing to this country. They just care more about other things. Third come the right-wing “media” outlets that serve as Trump’s propaganda arms. Among this group again I think we see dual motivations. The first is the kind of cynicism exposed in those publicly released Fox News depositions relating to the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit: Trump is good for business, so they lie for him to make money. The second motivation is more genuine: They truly despise liberals and liberalism and think we must be stopped at all costs, even when it involves lying to their audiences for a higher purpose. This mixture of the insincere and the sincere may seem incongruous, but actually the two motivations mesh together perfectly: The insincerity ensures that they defend and minimize every single thing Trump does, while the sincerity drives their coverage of Democrats and liberals, although it too is salted with plenty of cynicism, as when they try to persuade their viewers that some kooky neo-Marxist tenured postmodernist professor stands in for American liberalism. And finally—the MAGA faithful. Here let’s distinguish between the soft Trump supporters and the true red-hots. Of the 40 or 42 percent of Americans who still say they approve of Trump’s job performance, I’m guessing that a third or so are soft supporters. Some are swing voters. Some are evangelicals for whom a Democratic vote is basically out of the question. Some remember the first Trump economy fondly. There are lots of different motivations there, but what they have in common is that they don’t necessarily consider him America’s savior. But that other two-thirds … I hesitate to say these are bad human beings. But their rage at certain developments in the United States over these last 30-odd years is so overpowering that their civic and small-d democratic instincts have been buried by the antagonisms Trump has brought to the surface of American politics. They once knew, or they know, or a part of them knows, that no actual leader should be calling human beings “vermin.” But that empathic impulse isn’t much match for rage, which can be quite exhilarating and liberating (we all must admit that we know this feeling from personal experience). How deep does that rage run? We don’t yet know. We have yet to see its bottom. Tearing down part of the White House may lose him a portion of the softs, as polls suggest. But it won’t bother the red-hots, who’ll leap to point out, as I saw some nincompoop do on Newsmax Thursday night, that what Trump did was really no different from Barack Obama ordering the building of his basketball court. The pardon of Zhao is in fact the liberation of the crypto industry from the shackles imposed by Sleepy Joe. The DOJ bribe is money due to Trump fair and square. And so on and so on. I sometimes wonder what it will take for some of these folks to peel away. What if ICE agents just start shooting people? They already are; but I mean en masse. I doubt even that will change anything. Things will change when the rage stops being exhilarating, and I doubt that happens anytime soon. It takes all four of these groups to sustain Trumpism. If Republicans in Congress were doing their constitutional job, Trump would still be Trump but the legislative branch would have established the reality of limits. The corporate class could have said to him: We too know that we thrive best under democratic norms, and we cannot tolerate you breaking those. The right-wing media could still be basically pro-Trump while adhering more closely to the principles of conservatism than to genuflection before one man. And finally, his base too could at least from time to time acknowledge error on his part and demand that he adjust course. But none of these things are happening. And it’s hard to see them happening anytime soon. Bad as this week was, it’s not close to the bottom we’re going to hit. If you’ve heard any Republicans talk about Saturday’s No Kings marches across the country, you know what they’re calling them. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday referred to the marches collectively as a “hate America rally.” He continued: “Let’s see who shows up for that. I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display.” Many others on the right have echoed these sentiments over and over, and Fox News and the other state propaganda outlets have followed suit, thus washing the brains of their viewers into accepting, once again, the exact opposite of reality. You will probably find the occasional Marxist or antifa type or even the odd Hamas enthusiast marching somewhere tomorrow, because this is still a free country, and people aren’t asked a series of litmus-test questions before they’re allowed to join the fray. But overwhelmingly, these are marches of mainstream Americans. These are marches of teachers, lawyers, laborers, service workers, accountants, nurses, Pilates instructors, bank tellers—everyone. These are marches of people who love their country and are horrified at what President Donald Trump and the Republicans are doing to it. These are marches of patriots. The real, actual, thoughtful, quiet, modest, non-flag-hugging patriots (because history teaches us over and over that the people who need to make a show of hugging the flag are often the people who hate a country’s true ideals but need to fool folks into thinking the opposite so they can trample on those ideals and have it called patriotism). Have a gander at this map of march locations for tomorrow. There are 16 in Wyoming—a state notoriously pulsing with Hamasniks. There are 18 in Oklahoma, that veritable hornet’s nest of antifa hooliganism. There are another 18 in my home state of West Virginia (go, Morgantown contingent!), where Marxism has obviously taken deep root among an unsuspecting populace. Once again, these are not mere lies from Johnson et alia. I make this distinction from time to time, and it’s worth making again here. A lie is a mere denial of truth—“I never said that” or “No, Mom, that isn’t my pot, I was just holding it for Mark.” What Republicans are doing here, as they do with such regularity, is more than lie. They invert the truth. They say its exact opposite. They do so with two express intentions: to make people believe that their political foes are doing that which they themselves are trying to get away with, and to make it easier to get away with defiling the Constitution. But don’t ask me. Let’s ask James Madison. Imagine that the chief author of the Constitution and Bill of Rights could watch tomorrow’s events and observe the post-event spin. What would he think? Whose side would he be on? It’s obvious. He’d be with the marchers. And it’s not even close. How do we know this? For a lot of reasons, but perhaps chief among them is Federalist 47, penned by Madison, which discussed the importance of separation of powers. One of the hallmarks of Trump 2.0—and indeed, from a constitutional point of view, perhaps the hallmark—is the way that, as Trump has made so many moves to concentrate power in his own hands, the other branches of government have supinely gone along with absolutely everything. Congress under Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune is a joke, and as for the Supreme Court, well, it’s too tragic to be a joke. We’ve seen many examples of both branches bending over for Trump at every turn, but arguably, the most egregious one just happened: Trump diverting other monies to pay troops during the shutdown. As TNR’s Matt Ford shows here, it’s blatantly illegal. The Constitution says clearly that Congress appropriates such funds. Trump claimed the power to do so as commander in chief, but he has no such power. The Republican Congress has lain down and said fine. And the really pathetic thing here is that Congress could move a bill directing the payment of troops during the shutdown. It would pass easily. But that can’t happen because Johnson won’t call the House into session, because there’s a new Democrat waiting to be sworn in whose seating has potential ramifications for Trump with respect to the Jeffrey Epstein affair. Again, it all revolves around the wishes and perceived needs of Dear Leader. As for the Supreme Court, it has given Trump practically everything he’s asked for. It has defied him on a couple of minor occasions, but even on the most notable of those, its holding was vague and pusillanimous: It ruled in early April that the administration must “facilitate” the return to the country of Kilmar Abrego García, but it also held that a district court judge had gone too far in ruling that the administration had to “effectuate” his return (he was finally returned to the United States in June). But on almost all other matters, the court has given Trump exactly what he’s wanted. And this week, during the Voting Rights Act hearings, we saw a court majority working nakedly to advance the partisan goals of one political party and its president. Now—back to Madison. Federalist 47 was Madison’s brief to the citizenry in favor of the concept of separation of powers—and his argument to them that powers were sufficiently separated in this new Constitution so as to guard against tyranny. Because tyranny was his great concern. In fact, he wrote: “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective [emphasis mine], may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” This accumulation has not, I admit, happened in a legal sense. But in practice, this is precisely where we are today. So had Madison been among us these last nine months to observe what Trump and the Republicans and the court’s majority have done, there is no question that he would say: “Yes. This is tyranny.” I asked Michael Klarman of Harvard Law School, author of the amazing book The Framers’ Coup about the Constitutional Convention, for his thoughts on the relevance of all this. He emailed back: Madison and other Framers believed that “ambition would counteract ambition,” by which they meant largely that Congress would check an autocratically inclined executive. Madison and the other Framers were not anticipating the development of a party system, which actually happened quite soon after the founding. Today, all that matters to Republican members of Congress is that they support Trump, whether he is hiding something in the Epstein files, nominating incompetent people to run agencies, destroying congressionally created agencies, murdering people off the coast of Venezuela, or sending troops into American cities to oppress the people. Cowardly, toadying members of Congress are providing no check whatsoever on a tyrannical executive. It is an abandonment of their oaths, really no different from their predecessors who resigned their positions to join the Confederacy in 1860–61. And the courts? Klarman wrote, “Lower court judges are doing a great job in trying to check that executive. But the Supreme Court—out of some combination of fear, calculated effort not to be defied, and underlying agreement with much of Trump’s agenda—has mostly been complicit in Trump’s authoritarian project.” This is tyranny. We’re not lurching toward tyranny. It doesn’t loom on some hypothetical horizon. It’s here. Right now. Madison was right about tyranny. But obviously he was wrong that the Constitution was strong enough to guard against executive accumulation of power. He assumed, as Klarman put it, that the other branches would do their jobs. But Patrick Henry, the noted anti-federalist, turns out to have had the more sober view. In his speech against ratification, he anticipated people such as Donald Trump, Mike Johnson, and John Roberts: Where are your checks in this government? Your strongholds will be in the hands of your enemies. It is on a supposition that your American governors shall be honest, that all the good qualities of this government are founded; but its defective and imperfect construction puts it in their power to perpetrate the worst of mischiefs, should they be bad men; and, sir, would not all the world, from the Eastern to the Western hemisphere, blame our distracted folly in resting our rights upon the contingency of our rulers being good or bad? The Americans who are marching Saturday are the Americans who embrace Madison’s principle but have sadly come to acknowledge Henry’s insight. And they—not Trump, not Johnson, not Roberts—are the people who truly love this country. Johnson also said Wednesday that Saturday’s marchers are “the people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” As ever with these frauds, he was talking about himself. He may be dense enough not even to know it. But Saturday’s marchers know it all too well. David Axelrod is far better known these days for occasionally wagging his finger at his fellow Democrats than for breathing partisan fire, so it caught my eye when he posted this on X Wednesday: “So far, the ICE gang has shot & killed an unarmed man & lied about the circumstances; shot a woman 5 times for obstructing their vehicle; roughed up elderly women and zip-tied small children; shot a clergyman in the face with a pepper ball; marched through downtown Chicago, masked and armed. And they’re not going after the ‘worst of the worse,’ [sic] as promised. Most of the people they’re snagging have clean records. Some are citizens. To be clear: This is NOT making Chicago safer. It’s state-sponsored mayhem; dangerous political theater calculated to provoke.” Historians sometimes say that when societies are descending into fascism, it can be hard for the people to notice it in real time. Well, historians of the future, I’m here to tell you: We are noticing. Millions of us are noticing. And we are horrified and enraged. We are well aware: We once lived in a country that, for all its frequent imperfections, was a place where the rule of law was a broadly shared value and where leaders acted with democratic restraint. We now live in a country where there is no rule of law; where leaders, especially the president but also others who support him, spit on the idea not only of democratic restraint but of democracy itself; and where the timorous first reflex of nearly every member of one of our two political parties is, at virtually all times, to do precisely what the leader wants. That’s fascism. It may be—for now—a comparatively mild form of fascism. Political opponents aren’t being jailed or shot, opposition media outlets aren’t being shuttered, and books aren’t being burned. But a lot of things are happening that are terrifying. And last year, we lived in a country where the three scenarios I just listed were barely conceivable. Today, we live in a country where they are more likely only a matter of time. Let’s go back to Axelrod, and specifically, his use of the phrase “state-sponsored mayhem.” That is exactly what President Trump is imposing upon Chicago. To take just one of the incidents Axelrod cites: Pastor David Black of the First Presbyterian Church was with a small gaggle of protesters outside a Chicago ICE facility. Three agents stood on the roof of the two-story building as Black and the others stood on the sidewalk maybe 15 feet away from the building. Black raised his arms to the sky, as if in prayer. Someone who appears to be a fellow protester approached Black to confer with him. Next thing you see in this video is a considerable puff of smoke explode from Black’s forehead as he falls to the ground. That’s a clergyman. Exercising his First Amendment right (he’s fine, and he’s suing). Black later told CNN: “We could hear them laughing.” Shooting an unarmed and peacefully protesting pastor is by definition an act of state-sponsored mayhem. State-sponsored mayhem starts at the top, with the president’s thuggish, lawless threat to imprison the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago (by the way—Greg Sargent speaks to said governor, JB Pritzker, on his Daily Blast podcast today). From there, the people with the uniforms and the badges and the guns get the message, and they go out and do the things Axelrod listed above. Administration officials pile lie upon lie upon lie. With respect to Portland, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refers preposterously to “the radical left’s reign of terror” there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declares antifa to be “just as dangerous” as ISIS, which was killing perceived apostates by the thousands at its peak and raping little girls. Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, rants nightly about armed confrontations that either don’t exist or exist solely because the administration creates them so it can have the footage that will air over and over on its propaganda network, Fox News. It’s all toward the purpose of erasing dissent, erasing democracy. As Zeteo’s Kim Wehle put it last week, reporting on two Trump-issued “national security” directives: “The president is taking steps to criminalize being anti-Trump in America.” When a president and his aides are doing that, it’s no longer America. When masked government thugs take potshots at a priest, it’s no longer America. When a handpicked hack prosecutor with no prosecutorial experience indicts two honorable American citizens within a month of the president ordering their prosecutions, and when two real prosecutors quit rather than pursue these obscenely political prosecutions, it’s no longer America. When the third-ranking official in the country, the speaker of the House of Representatives, delays the swearing-in of a duly elected member of that body because he knows she will vote to release files that potentially may shed light on unsavory behavior by the president, it’s no longer America. When the presidential administration announces that it’s going after nonprofit charitable groups that have operated unmolested in this country for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations because they donate to causes the president disfavors, it’s no longer America. When naturalized citizens are canceling overseas trips because they can’t be certain they’ll be welcomed back to their own country upon return, it’s no longer America. When the Department of Education is bullying universities into agreeing to a “compact” under which they’ll promise not to “belittle” conservative ideas, it’s no longer America. When the president and his family have used his office to enrich themselves to the tune of $3.5 billion in nine months, and when the Congress, controlled by the president’s party, refuses to do a thing about this rancid, dictator-level corruption, it’s no longer America. When the Supreme Court of the United States has sold its soul to all this barbarity, it’s no longer America. And when this thuggish dictator-wannabe is also a buffoonish man-child who sits there in his breathtakingly tacky Oval Office with his fake face and fake hair next to another head of state (the president of Finland) as he boasts yet again about passing a simple dementia test that a 10-year-old could ace, and we realize that this man-child is the sitting president, it’s no longer America, at least for anyone who cares about how we look to the rest of the world. Historians of the future: Rest assured, millions of us know all this in real time. We are horrified, shocked, enraged, and ashamed. We are acting, in a thousand ways, to oppose it. This cannot, and will not, be how the United States ends. President Donald Trump has finally told the truth about something. He’s embraced Project 2025. Anyone who believed his disavowals last year during the campaign is, of course, a fool. And the media, reporting those disavowals, looked foolish. Trump knew, as he has known all his life, that all you have to do is lie about something, and the press, following the rules of objectivity, will report straightforwardly what you said. So he largely got away with it. The Kamala Harris campaign tried to tie Trump to the project, as in this ad; but it didn’t manage to convey the project’s extremism with any force. And now? The Democrats have another huge opportunity to hang Project 2025 around Trump’s neck. It should be easier now, for two reasons. One, it’s not purely hypothetical anymore. According to the Project 2025 Tracker, a community-driven initiative, the Trump administration has already checked off 48 percent of the project’s goals. Two, Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought’s open promises to shred the federal bureaucracy give Democrats a huge target. The question is, do they have the skill—and the guts—to hit it? Alas, that question, as usual with the Democrats, should have a clear answer but doesn’t. The obvious strategy is to call all hands on deck and, now that Trump has said what he said, make this shutdown about not only Obamacare subsidies but two other things: about the looming job cuts themselves and about Vought personally because his name and his extremist, un-American goals to remake the United States as a Christian nation should be known to every American. The first message should be simple: What Trump and Vought are about to do here is the second coming of Elon Musk and DOGE. The DOGE effort was not exactly popular: Last spring, poll after poll, like this one, showed that while the general concept of cutting the size of the federal government had appeal, people really didn’t like the way Musk and his minions were going about it. This time around, Democrats can plausibly say that it’s going to be worse. DOGE staffing cuts came to around 300,000. An estimated 750,000 federal employees are being furloughed due to the shutdown. Vought probably thinks most of them are expendable. It shouldn’t be hard to make these cuts deeply unpopular. Second, tell Americans who Vought is, what he believes, the things he has said. He’s a Christian nationalist who believes Trump is “God’s gift” to America and wants the U.S. to be “a nation under God.” These are of course completely un-American ideas. Article 6 of the Constitution contains the “no religious test clause,” which applies to holding a public office or trust in the U.S.; but beyond that, the Founders were crystal clear that American citizenship and civil rights were open to all—as Thomas Jefferson once put it, citing John Locke, neither “Pagan nor Mohametan [Muslim] nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth [of Virginia] because of his religion.” George Washington said that “religious controversies are always more productive of acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause,” and therefore each should be left to worship (or not) as he or she saw fit. I could go on and on and on. Making these two arguments requires the Democrats to take two moral and unambiguous stands. The first is in defense of an activist federal government. The second is in defense of the religious pluralism upon which this country was founded. I’d love to be able to write with confidence that I think they’ll do it. Odds are they won’t. Most of them shy away from moral arguments. They’re afraid—not all of them, but most of them—to go toe to toe with Trump on a topic like religion. There is utterly no reason for this. Most Americans agree with them. Polls will often show that a disturbingly high percentage of Americans want this country to be a Christian nation, but when you look at crosstabs, you see quickly that the number is high because among Republicans it’s around 75 percent. It’s well under 50 percent among independents, which is the number that matters. Still, the Democratic Party has trained itself over the years to stay away from such matters. They also just don’t speak with one voice and hold together. Right now, the only poll I’ve seen on the shutdown looks very good for them. A Washington Post survey found that respondents blamed Trump and Republicans over Democrats by 47 percent to 30 percent. Interestingly, independents blamed Republicans over Democrats by 50 percent to 22 percent. You’d think and hope that would gird Democrats’ loins. And maybe it will. But remember: Three Senate Democrats voted for the Republican version of the bill to reopen the government. Four more need to cave for the Republicans to get their bill through. Democratic senators are heading back to their states this weekend, where they’re going to hear from furloughed federal workers about how they need their paychecks. In a sense this is understandable and defensible. Democrats tend to care about these people’s actual lives, whereas Republicans don’t give a crap about them since they’re just a bunch of deep-state Trump haters anyway. Also, Democrats genuinely don’t want to see hundreds of thousands of federal employees lose their jobs, both on a simple human level and because Democrats believe these people are doing important work. So that’s all nice. But at the same time, the Democrats could win this fight. If the Post poll is right, they’re already winning. And now that Trump has introduced the unpopular Project 2025 into the equation, the door is open for the Democrats to make Trump’s posture here even more unpopular. Also, I’d argue that to the extent the shutdown will result in chaos, well, people understand that it’s Trump who is the sower of chaos in this country. Majorities are far more likely to blame Trump for chaos than Democrats. So the Democrats can win this. They need to stand together and stick to principles. I just wish history suggested they were better at this. The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel was about the 2,786th objectionable thing this second Trump administration has done. Many of its attacks on the American way of life have been utterly horrific—some have been direct assaults on the rule of law, others have sent completely innocent human beings to detention camps. So why does an action taken against a late-night host stand out? It’s a frontal attack on the one element of our social contract that nearly everyone, from left to right, agrees on and values more than anything: freedom of speech. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787 decided against including a Bill of Rights, confident that everyone would understand that the federal government would exercise only the powers enumerated in the document itself. But many critics, mostly those known as the anti-Federalists, insisted that that wasn’t enough. They said: Add a list of specifically enumerated rights, or we’re not ratifying. And so, James Madison, who had been a strong opponent of such a list in 1787, turned around and, as a member of the first U.S. Congress representing the fifth district of Virginia, drew up the list the critics demanded. His original list included 17 rights. Congress passed 12, and the states ratified 10. There was never any question as to which right would be enumerated first. The First Amendment concerns both religion and speech, but over the centuries, freedom of worship has grown less contested, and it has been the cause of free speech rights for which people have fought and gone to prison. Historically, most attempts to suppress speech have come from those in power trying to silence various forms of protest or dissent (hence, from the right, generally speaking). Recent years have seen the emergence of a small but vocal anti–free speech left, whose presence is mostly limited to social media and college campuses, and which is about to make Bari Weiss a very rich woman. But the vast majority of us agree: Free speech is inviolate and applies to all of us, even those with noxious views. A poll last year found that 63 percent of Americans considered free speech “very important.” It was second only to inflation and ahead of crime, health care, immigration, and seven other issues. Not bad for an abstract idea. But abstract ideas last only as long as those who have power—political and financial power—agree that they should last. James Madison couldn’t have contemplated Donald Trump. And he never would have imagined Perry Sook and Chris Ripley. Wait, who are Perry Sook and Chris Ripley, you ask? They are the men, Sook in particular, who made this Kimmel cancellation, this direct attack against free speech, happen. Their names don’t appear in many news stories. More people need to know who they are. Sook is the CEO of Nexstar Media Group. He started the company in the 1990s with one local television station, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Today, Nexstar owns 197 stations. It also operates NewsNation, the cable news channel trying to compete with Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. NewsNation is where disgraced CNN anchor Chris Cuomo landed, and its “talent” is somewhat ideologically mixed. But Sook, 66, has dropped broad hints in past interviews about his own leanings. Last November, he expressed the hope that “fact-based journalism will come back into vogue, as well as eliminating the level of activist journalism out there.” You might think that by “activist journalism,” he means, you know, the cable news network that paid a $787 million settlement to a private company to avoid being forced to admit that it told lies about the 2020 election. But you’d be wrong. On Wednesday, he showed us what and who he means by “activist journalism”: Jimmy Kimmel, over one comment that right-wing social media went to town on. Chris Ripley is the CEO of the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Sinclair is better known than Nexstar. It vaulted to public prominence after that chilling 2018 video went viral of dozens of local Sinclair anchors reading from the same Orwellian script about “fake news.” Sinclair is more avowedly right-wing than Nexstar. But they both passionately share and are pursuing one central right-wing goal: the end of media regulation in the United States. Under FCC rules, no single owner can reach more than 39 percent of households. These kinds of regulations go back to the 1920s, when radio first hit the scene, and they were designed to make sure that Americans heard a range of voices. No one on either end of the political spectrum challenged them for decades. In the late 1960s, a Pennsylvania right-wing radio preacher (why is it always people like this?) went on air to smear a local journalist who had attacked Barry Goldwater. The matter went up to the Supreme Court, which held—unanimously, left to right—that the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine was consistent with the First Amendment: That is, the court said, yes, the exposure to opposing viewpoints was an essential part of democracy. Traditional news and speech values, imperfect though they were, held for about six decades. Then merger mania hit in the 1980s, and we began to understand that media companies were companies—were interested in profit more than civic ideas such as truth and free speech. At the same time, the Reagan administration started going after the Fairness Doctrine. Later came Rupert Murdoch and Fox. Then came merger after merger after merger. Sad to say, it was Barack Obama’s FCC, under Chair Julius Genachowski, that finally killed off the Fairness Doctrine officially, but it had been long since functionally dead anyway. Right now, Sook awaits FCC approval of a merger that will allow Nexstar to be in more than 39 percent of American homes. And Sinclair wants to grow and grow. And that is what happened Wednesday night. Sook announced that his 32 ABC stations would not broadcast Kimmel’s show. Sinclair, with its 30 ABC affiliates, made a similar announcement shortly thereafter. And ABC—or really, Disney—caved. Even so, this might not have been quite the crisis it is with someone else in the White House. Under President Kamala Harris, for example, would Sook and Nexstar even be petitioning a Democratic FCC for this merger? Probably not. The current Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, has clearly stated her opposition (to TNR’s Greg Sargent, among others) to what Chairman Brendan Carr did in threatening ABC and Kimmel. Recent Democratic FCC Chairs Jessica Rosenworcel (Biden) and Tom Wheeler (Obama) have been strong voices for media diversity. It seems to me a safe bet that under President Harris, none of this would be happening. But she is not in the White House. Donald Trump is. And a right-wing hero was just assassinated. Trump and his movement will use Charlie Kirk’s murder to justify any number of unconstitutional and illegal actions. And it filters down from them. Clemson University has fired five faculty and administrators. Teachers are losing their jobs over their social media posts about Kirk. And it sure isn’t Trump firing them. He has created an atmosphere of fear that many, many others on down the right-wing food chain, from Sook and Ripley to local school administrators, will zealously enforce. And that’s why this week is different. It pitted a near-universally cherished American value against a combination of corporate power and authoritarian contempt for that value—and the value was smashed to pieces. If you’re terrified of where all this may end, you are right to be. Stephen Colbert is gone; Kimmel, possibly gone for good (I hope not). CBS is becoming conservative. Skydance, the company handing CBS to Bari Weiss, may be about to take over CNN. The Washington Post is cracking up. The New York Times faces another one of Trump’s $15 billion lawsuits. In this next year or two, we may well be counting on the Times to do what CBS and ABC have refused to do and fight this battle to the bitter end. The text of the First Amendment was edited down from Madison’s original language. His first-draft passage on speech and the press said: “The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.” I wish that language had remained—it’s clearer and more emphatic, especially that “inviolable” part. It might have stiffened the backs of the people we’re going to be counting on to preserve free speech in this country and made it harder for right-wing federal judges to chip away at these rights. It would not, alas, make any difference to tyrants, and as of Wednesday night, it’s clearer than it ever was before that tyranny is where we’re headed. I will admit that I learned some useful things about Charlie Kirk this week. I learned that he commanded a unique respect and even ardor on the MAGA right. Old high school friends who are MAGA pop up regularly on my Facebook feed, and they were distraught, several to the point of tears. They had him pegged for a future president, which sure had never occurred to me, but which made sense after I gave it some thought. He was young, articulate, nice-looking; possessed of a certain kind of charisma. He had an instinct for how to connect with young men emotionally. I’ve also read some liberals who knew him saying in these last couple of days that he was, in person, unfailingly polite, and that matters. This is the Kirk the right remembers: someone who engaged in civil debate and persuasion and who infuriated liberals only because he was smart and he usually won. Kirk’s most ardent fans can, and will, believe what they want. The truth is that he infuriated a lot of us because he spread toxic lies across this country like a blanket of Agent Orange (David Corn and Joan Walsh iterated a number of them this week). And while he often had an impressive battery of facts at his command, his manner of debating involved a lot of dishonest rhetorical legerdemain. I watched a clip Thursday in which he challenged a young white male student somewhere: “What can a white man do in this country that a Black man can’t do?” It’s a very clever question. That framing—the use of the verb “do”—reduces racism to matters of the freedom to move about in society. And in that sense, what’s the problem? Yes, we once had white and “colored” waiting rooms down South, but these days, a Black father can take his kids to a ballgame just the same as a white father can. But a real conversation about racism means talking, for example, about the historical legacies that have resulted in white households owning on average $250,400 in wealth and Black households $24,520. That’s a direct result of Blacks not being allowed to buy houses in most neighborhoods in this country until relatively recently. In addition, there is still tons of discrimination in mortgage lending. That’s what racism is, and the fact that Black men can “do” a lot of what white men can “do” in this country does nothing to mitigate these persistent facts—facts that only liberals, by the way, have ever had the courage to try to change. Was Kirk’s assassination a tragedy? It was absolutely a tragedy. Whether the killer had a political motivation or not, the silencing of a voice, even a toxic voice, in that fashion is ghastly. If you spend enough time online (and here’s a good reason why you shouldn’t), you’ll be able to find people, seemingly somewhere on the left of the political spectrum, chortling over Kirk’s death. It’s an understatement to say that this is very bad form. But you’ll struggle to find any prominent liberal leaders or elected Democrats saying anything like, oh, for example, the insanely irresponsible things Mike Lee—a U.S. senator!—said when Minnesota Democrat Melissa Hortman and her husband were executed by a right-wing extremist. Here’s what I have seen, though: I’ve seen a number of figures on the right saying, instantly and well in advance of an assailant being identified (news that the alleged gunman was arrested didn’t break until Friday morning) that “the left” was responsible for Kirk’s death. Dozens of them, from Donald Trump on down, jumped immediately to this conclusion. They did this to a ferocious degree after both assassination attempts on Donald Trump’s life. Especially after the first one, many prominent figures on the right started pointing fingers at people and organizations on the broad left (The New Republic included) for having Trump’s blood on their hands. This was relentless for about three days; I remember it very well. Then it turned out that would-be assassin Matthew Crooks in fact had no particular political motivation—he was a bullied loner probably seeking notoriety. But during those first days, it was taken as a given on the right that Crooks was a Trump-hating leftist. The second attempt on Trump’s life came a scant two months later. You might have thought, given how wrong they were the first time, they would have waited. But again, many figures on the right rushed to say Ryan Routh was a registered Democrat, which he once was but hadn’t been for a long time. This time, in fairness, figures on the left pointed to other evidence saying Routh had Republican sympathies. But it turns out that he is just a confused man, as he proved this week in (as fate would have it) Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom where he is on trial for the assassination attempt—and where his rambling opening statement touched on Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford, and the Wright brothers. The right always jump to such conclusions, and to talk of revenge, not justice. The biggest jumper of all is Trump himself, who delivered an absolutely chilling address Wednesday night from the Oval Office. He said his administration would ferret out “those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.” If another president had said something like that, we could take it as playing to his peanut gallery. But when Trump says it, we should assume that he and his movement mean it. “Those who contributed to this atrocity” could mean thousands of people and organizations, and “other political violence” can mean anything Trump and Stephen Miller want it to mean. They will use this tragic event to try to bully non-Trump America into submission. Some people on the right are genuinely in mourning. They may choose not to see the sides of Charlie Kirk they don’t wish to see (and I’m still having trouble understanding how spewing such hatred and provocation is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ), but that’s what grieving human beings often do—right, left, and in between. Let them mourn in peace. But Trump and many leaders on the right are vowing to use this tragedy to do what they’ve always wanted to do anyway: to make this a more authoritarian society in which blunt criticism of the regime becomes redefined as incitement to violence and even terrorism. On Thursday, the State Department warned immigrants not to mock Kirk’s death. In Trump’s America, we can be sure it’s not going to stop there. More ghastly, parallel-universe news this week. The man in charge of America’s public health said he didn’t know how many people died of Covid and added, despite his ignorance, that he is certain that the Covid vaccine has killed more people than Covid itself did (all this while he’s denying Americans access to the Covid vaccine). We committed a probable act of war against Venezuela. The president of the United States was mocked by the leaders of China, Russia, and India. And as of Friday, the Department of Defense is apparently going back to the future and becoming the Department of War, I guess because “defense” is too passive a cognomen for the real men of MAGA-land. But maybe the most ominous development of the week doesn’t concern the Trump administration at all. It’s the news that Bari Weiss is apparently about to become the head, or something, of CBS News. This is bad for CBS, sure. But it’s a lot bigger than that: It is the securing for the right wing of another key beachhead in the American media landscape, which, as I’ve warned repeatedly, will within a generation (or sooner) consist of a lot of large, noisy, avowedly right-wing outlets and a small handful of mainstream outlets that are too weak and feckless to defend what remains of our democracy—and will thus be acting as the handmaidens of their own destruction, if they aren’t already. This is certainly an “only in America” story, but I do not mean that in the normal, heroic sense. I mean it in the creepy, corporate, it’s-all-about-profit sense. CBS began life in 1927 as a radio network, expanding into television as that medium grew. It had entertainment and news divisions, and later sports; its news division was considered the best in the United States, and, along with the British Broadcasting Corporation, a model for mainstream media standards in democracies. It wasn’t being “liberal” when Edward R. Murrow helped take down Joe McCarthy. It was acting in defense of democracy against a sinister and dishonest demagogue. Over the decades—and this was a natural-enough progression—CBS became a huge corporation, expanding into movies, amusements, even musical instruments (it was said to have ruined Fender guitars for about 20 years, although today those guitars—I own one—are considered vintage, go figure). But even this wasn’t so horrible, until the age of megamergers brought on by what was essentially the end of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. Fade in, fade out: CBS formed Viacom, then they split, then they remerged. Paramount, which had owned part of CBS back in the 1930s, came back into the picture. In 2009, Paramount announced a partnership with this new thing called Skydance, which had been created in 2006 by David Ellison. In July 2024, Skydance and Paramount, now CBS’s parent, announced their intention to merge. You will recall what happened next. That fall, as the merger was under governmental review, and during the presidential campaign, 60 Minutes broadcast an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. With no evidence, Donald Trump charged that it was edited to make Harris look good. And so, exactly 70 years after CBS (and Murrow) took down one demagogue, it cowered and crumbled when confronted by another. The reason was obvious: Ellison and others wanted Trump’s Justice Department to approve the merger. In other words, profit was put ahead of the journalistic reputation of CBS News’s crown jewel program. CBS—actually, Paramount Global—decided to pay Trump $16 million (toward his “library”). It was an implicit admission that maybe Trump was right; that their most venerated news program perhaps was guilty of liberal bias, even though Trump never produced one lick of evidence that 60 Minutes had done anything wrong, anything that wasn’t part of standard broadcast practice. But Trump was clearly appeased, and, lo and behold, two months ago, the Trump administration approved the merger. On August 7, Ellison gave a press conference in New York, where he swore that no favors had been promised Trump. “We are not going to politicize anything today,” Ellison said. “We want to entertain first.” One can call Bari Weiss many things, but “apolitical” is not among them. She’s undoubtedly smart, and, with her wildly successful Substack publication The Free Press, she cunningly saw a market niche in identifying private-school wokery—rather than, say, the fact that one of our two major political parties is descending into fascism—as the gravest threat to the American way of life. I readily concede that what we call “wokeism” contains some excesses, some illiberal manifestations that run counter to the values of tolerance and open-minded debate. But the idea that students and administrators at a handful of universities are a bigger danger to democracy than Donald Trump and JD Vance and Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is absurd and dangerous. That is the view, however, of a certain slice of the American elite: wealthy people who tend to have gone to those schools, or who send their kids to them, and who, while not openly racist or sexist in most cases, nevertheless get the heebie-jeebies from all those Black and brown and trans people screaming about their rights—and who, more than anything else, in fact far more than anything else, want their tax cuts. And soon, CBS News will reflect their priorities and tell them the stories about the threats to the U.S. that they want to hear. In doing so, it will join not only Fox News and Newsmax and Sinclair, which increasingly controls local media. The Washington Post too appears to be traveling in that direction. In a few years, there just won’t be much mainstream media left. And I hate to say this, but that is partly their fault too. Weiss first became famous at The New York Times, when she expertly parlayed a hullabaloo over a controversial op-ed by GOP Senator Tom Cotton into a victimhood narrative about left-wing intolerance. She published a resignation letter that was praised by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump Jr., among others. All that attention led to her getting the funding to launch and grow The Free Press, for which David Ellison is now reportedly paying her at least $100 million, maybe more. An American success story, I suppose. But here’s the thing. The Times never should have been hiring someone like Weiss in the first place. She was at The Wall Street Journal editorial page before. Ask yourself: Has the Journal opinion page ever hired a liberal away from the Times? Maybe, although I can’t think of one. But in 2017, after Trump won, the Times hired both Weiss and Bret Stephens from the Journal. And at some point in there, the Times hired yet another young right-winger, Adam Rubenstein, who was the primary editor of the Cotton op-ed. Well, a Times defender would say, the liberal Times is more committed to diverse viewpoints than the conservative Journal, and that is a good thing. Up to a point, that’s true. And once upon a dear old time, a newspaper like the Times could hire, say, William Safire—hack and propagandist though he was—as an act of magnanimity to give a prominent platform to a conservative voice because conservative voices were indeed underrepresented in the media at the time. But that is hardly the case now. It brings to mind that old joke about some liberals being so open-minded that their brains start falling out of their ears. That open-mindedness, to circle us back to where we started, is on regular display at the Times these days, as I noted a month ago. The RFK Jr. Senate hearing Thursday was a shitshow. He obfuscated, he lied, he evaded, he humiliated himself. He is dismantling his agency and destroying public health. People will die because of his decisions, if they aren’t already. All of this was on horrid display Thursday. And the Times’ original headline on its account of the hearing? “A Defiant Kennedy Defends Vaccine Changes and C.D.C. Shakeup.” Great. Kennedy was savaged by senators of both parties for his lies and for shredding American public health to pieces, and the Times rewards him with the adjective “defiant.” Be assured that Bari Weiss’s CBS won’t be guilty of such equivocation in the name of “fairness.” That’s the difference, and that’s a big part of the reason why this democracy is dying. Donald Trump has, of course, done a lot of shocking things as president, things even previous Republicans wouldn’t have done. We focus most of our coverage on those things, and rightly so. But on one issue, he’s been a pretty standard Republican president, which is to say to say he’s been horrible and wicked in the standard way. The issue is guns. Before the Minneapolis shooting fades out of the news cycle, let’s look at the grisly Trump record, which has largely passed under the radar. We begin with his February 7 executive order called “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.” It stated in the opening paragraph: “Because it is foundational to maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and bear arms must not be infringed.” It then directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review existing laws and regulations and so on “to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.” This has led to a process that seeks to restore the gun rights of convicted felons. And so, on July 18, the Justice Department published a rule to that effect. The press release’s opening sentence reads: “President Trump directed the Department of Justice to address the ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens—all of them.” Further down, the release quotes Ed Martin, the administration’s pardon attorney and a MAGA extremist whose nomination for a U.S. Attorney position was withdrawn because he probably couldn’t get the votes: “General Bondi’s support of the rebooted 925(c) program is consistent with President Donald J. Trump’s promise to the American people to support the beautiful Second Amendment.” So that’s number one: The DOJ is going out of its way to restore gun rights to convicted felons—a category, of course, that includes Donald Trump himself. But the EO and other actions by the administration go a lot farther. Trump ordered a review of every gun-regulating move made by the Biden administration. For example, on April 7, Bondi revoked a Biden-era rule that allowed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to rescind the licenses of gun dealers that break the law by falsifying records. Ponder that: Businesses that knowingly break the law now have immunity from federal oversight. There’s plenty more. On May 16, the administration agreed to a settlement of several lawsuits under which the Justice Department would no longer enforce machine-gun ban laws (which date to the 1930s) against guns with forced-reset trigger (FRT) devices. An FRT, which is a recently developed technology, allows the shooter to fire at an increased rate. The NRA and manufacturers say it’s no big deal, the shooter still has to fire each shot separately; gun-safety advocates counter that by mechanically resetting the trigger position after a shot is fired, FRT’s still dramatically increase the fire rate, essentially turning some semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. So these will now be sold again. FRT’s have been after-market devices, but now, they might be installed at point of sale. The Republicans’ big, ugly budget bill factors in here, too. A transfer tax on silencers has been part of U.S. law since 1934. The tax was imposed for the obvious reason that silencers tended to be used by the bad guys. You don’t need silencer to shoot a grouse or defend your family from an intruder. It was paid by either the buyer or seller and was set at $200. In all those decades, it was never raised ($200 then would be close to $4,900 today). But at least it existed. As of next January 1, it will be $0. This is who Trump is: a cynical and strictly transactional person who, once upon a time, spoke reasonably sensibly about guns, but who realized once he entered politics that anyone who wants the GOP presidential nomination has to sell his soul to the NRA, so he sold his (probably wasn’t expensive). This is another thing we kind of stopped paying attention to, because he does so many other things that are, or appear to be, so much more outrageous. But I take note every year of what Trump tells the NRA. In the summer of 2024, he spoke to the group in person and said, among other things: • “Let there be no doubt the survival of our Second Amendment is very much on the ballot. You know what they want to do. If they get in, our country’s going to be destroyed in so many ways. But the second Amendment will be … It’s under siege. But with me, they never get anywhere.” • “If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns, 100% certain. Crooked Joe has a 40-year record of trying to rip firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.” • “They’re going after the ammunition. When the radical-left Democrats tried to use Covid to shut down gun sales during the China virus, I proudly designated gun and ammunition retailers as critical infrastructure so they couldn’t touch it.” This April, the group convened in Atlanta, and Trump addressed the assemblage via video, bragging about all the above and more, saying: “There is much more to come. Americans are born free, and under the Trump administration, we will live free—always live free. With me in the White House, your sacred rights will not be infringed.” Now, after Minneapolis, Vice President JD Vance and Melania Trump are out there trying to shift the topic from guns to mental health. It’s a total dodge, an attempt to talk about anything but guns; but okay, we have an obvious five-alarm mental healthcare crisis in this country, so to the extent that this administration really wants to do something about that—great. But as usual, the rhetoric is completely the opposite of the reality. The drastic Medicaid cuts in the big, ugly bill will impact mental health services in a vast array of ways. MindSite News, which covers mental health policy, wrote after the bill became law: “The previous five years—including the final year of Trump’s first presidency—had seen the renewal of a federal commitment to mental health. Over those years, federal funding for mental health services increased. New programs like the 988 hotline were created and funded. Funding streams were established to boost crisis response services and to support school-based mental health. Tough new health insurance regulations were enacted to improve access to coverage for mental health services.” That last point is especially key. Insurers don’t cover mental health the way they cover physical health (this, by the way, is an issue the Democrats should seize; mental health doesn’t interest the media much, but I guarantee you it is of keen interest to parents everywhere, of all political stripes). But this bill, the site notes, signals that “the days of a federal commitment to addressing the U.S. mental health crisis are essentially over.” So they’re even hypocrites on the one issue on which they’re showing “concern.” But let’s conclude by going back to gun policy. The guns purchased by the Minneapolis shooter were bought legally. Press accounts note this and then quickly move on, as if to say there’s no point in discussing gun laws here. But there is. There always is. Authorities haven’t revealed what kinds of guns, beyond saying there were three—a shotgun, a rifle, and a pistol. Maybe they’re not even in the categories of weapons we debate. I’d still like to know how someone with such obvious mental health issues passed the background checks. Minnesota strengthened its background check law under Governor Tim Walz in 2023, but someone somewhere still decided that Robin Westman could own guns responsibly, and we deserve to know more about who and why. In the meantime, Trump 2.0 so far shows every sign of doing anything the NRA wants it to do. They can offer all the thoughts and prayers they want, and they can prattle on about mental health until the sun sets. But it’s their actions that matter, and their actions say they’re perfectly content to let more children die. This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up here You may not know the name Lindsey Halligan. She’s not a scholar. Not a Ph.D. She hasn’t written any books on history. She has, however, worked as an insurance claims lawyer. Her most celebrated achievement, apparently, was defeating a 2019 claim seeking $500,000 in damages from her client over a damaged roof. How she managed to join Trump’s defense team remains unclear, but she was called to Mar-a-Lago the day the FBI came in with its warrant to collect those classified documents. Once on the team, she did what they all do, namely, grovel—she made an appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast where she vowed to sue CNN for claiming that Trump was lying about the 2020 election results. Trump sought $475 million in damages in that case, but in July 2023, a federal judge dismissed it. Today, Halligan holds something few others in government probably do: a very fancy title that runs to a full 19 words (Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary). She is overseeing the … what’s the right word here? There are so many to choose from … “reimagining” of the Smithsonian Institution. That’s right. An insurance claims lawyer is now in charge of making sure that the Smithsonian’s 21 museums, 21 libraries, 14 research centers, one zoo, and 157 million items and artifacts are brought into line with the wishes of the Mad King. I see, looking back over them, that the tone of the above two paragraphs is a bit jocular. But this is no laughing matter. Forget Halligan. Maybe she’s smarter than I think, maybe she’s not. Maybe she’s a hardcore racist, maybe she’s not. But she’s not the point. The point here is Trump. He is not smarter than I think. I suspect he’s never read a history book in his life, and chances are pretty decent he’s never been to a museum, except to galas Ivana dragged him to back when. And about his hardcore racism, there is utterly no question. But we don’t talk about it enough. Trump long ago established to the satisfaction of everyone outside of MAGA world that he’s a racist to the bone. He and his father wouldn’t rent to Black people. He said those sick things about the defendants in the Central Park jogger case (they weren’t guilty). He said, “Laziness is a trait in Blacks.” He said some white supremacists in Charlottesville were “very fine people.” I could go on and on. Being long-established, Trump’s racism is not “news.” Regular readers of mine will know this is one of my longtime complaints about the nature and structure of the media. There are lots of things that aren’t “news,” per se, but are true, important, and defining of our reality. Trump’s racism is one of those things. It hovers over everything. It defines nearly everything he does. And it is making the United States of America a cruel, sick, mean place. His racism is what’s propelling this edict over the Smithsonian. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” he whined Tuesday on Truth Social. When he talks this way, he’s sending a much broader message that is widely understood, by both his political foes and (especially) his supporters. Each group knows it’s part of a broader attack that is designed to keep certain Americans “in their place.” It’s just that the latter group approves. His racism is what’s driving the presence of these National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. His motorcade, traveling from the White House to his Virginia golf club, passes a small greensward along what’s called the E Street Expressway where there are (or were) a few tents, and that’s probably how he got his entire impression of D.C. crime, along with the background knowledge that D.C. is a heavily Black city (Black residents are no longer a majority, but still a plurality). The troops aren’t even fighting actual crime. They’re mostly around the National Mall, where it’s as safe as Mayberry in the 1960s. The troops are just a symbol for white MAGA world that he’s cracking some Black heads. His racism is behind this sick redistricting madness in Texas. Nonwhite people make up 60 percent of the state’s population. By the time the Texas legislature is finished, the Texas congressional delegation will likely be more than 70 percent white and Republican. In Missouri, the redistricting under consideration would slice a Black Democratic district in Kansas City into maybe three different pieces. Republicans have done this sort of thing long before Trump, but under Trump, of course, it’s being taken to extremes because Republicans now know that anti-Black extremism on such matters is the only thing that gets the boss’s attention. His racism is behind his talk about mail-in ballots and early voting and all his phony allegations about fraudulent voting. Everybody knows very well what, and whom, he’s talking about when he talks about such things. He means Black and, to a slightly lesser extent, Latino people. His racism is the fundamental reason for these mass detentions. Would Trump, and the right wing in general, be this worked up about illegal border crossings if it was mostly white people doing it? Of course they wouldn’t. There would be no rhetoric about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the nation. Finally—although surely there’s more—it’s racism that animates a lot of his rhetorical attacks on individual Americans. It’s no accident that his recent targets prominently include Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King (her close friend), Beyoncé, Al Sharpton, Letitia James, and Charlamagne tha God. He goes after lots of people of all races, but Black people are disproportionately targeted, and it’s not an accident. I have no idea where Lindsey Halligan fits in here. She’s spent most of her adult life thinking about hurricanes. She’s interchangeable with any other Mar-a-Lago sycophant who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But the fact that Trump put someone in charge of remaking the Smithsonian who’s totally unqualified is what’s important here because it tells us that the person is there solely to follow his orders. Trump’s orders will be based on his worldview. And his worldview is the most blatantly and openly racist worldview that’s been held by an American president since Woodrow Wilson. We need to remember this—even, or especially, when the media forgets. Republican Representative Bryan Steil thought it would be a good idea to go have a meetup with constituents Thursday night in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Steil represents Paul Ryan’s old district and in fact used to work for Ryan. He’d had a rocky week: A few days before, some protesters plopped some flowers and a coffin on the doorstep of his Janesville home, an act meant to symbolize the ill effects of the Republicans’ big, ugly bill on the most vulnerable. Things didn’t get much better Thursday night. Steil was booed repeatedly, particularly on immigration, with one woman saying, with reference to Alligator Alcatraz: “The difference between a prison or a detention center and a concentration camp is due process.” Asked another, about ICE agents, to robust applause: “Why are they wearing masks, and why are they unidentified?” Congress is in recess now for the new month, so we can be sure that Steil’s fellow Republicans took note and will spend the month hiding from constituencies and hanging out at country clubs where tax cuts for the rich are popular and nobody needs Medicaid (or at least they think they don’t). Donald Trump, it is said, is frustrated. He wonders why he’s not more popular. He complains, we read, that he’s accomplished a great deal and that he’s keeping his campaign promises, and looked at a certain way, these statements are true, to a point. So he can’t figure out why he’s at 37 percent. I could tell him why. Two reasons, and they’re both obvious. First, his policies are horrible, and people don’t like them. If you’re “accomplishing” things that large majorities of people don’t want, do they count as accomplishments? Film director Uwe Boll somehow manages to keep making movies. But he’s a punch line. Most of his movies have been commercial flops and critical train wrecks—a career so lame that he once promised to quit the business if a petition demanding that he do so garnered a million signatures (alas, it fell short). That’s Trump: the Uwe Boll of policy. The recent polls have told us over and over and over. The big, ugly bill—unpopular. Rounding up poor guys hanging out at Home Depot looking for work—unpopular. Putting people in, yes, concentration camps—unpopular. Cutting his Palm Beach pals’ taxes—unpopular. Imposing these absurd tariffs—unpopular. I could go on. There is literally not a single important item on the Trump domestic agenda that polls well. Then there are the promises he’s broken. He said he’d lower prices on day one. Which, you’ll recall, was the same day on which he was going to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. And bring peace to the Middle East. It’s a pleasant surprise here lately that he’s talking smack about Putin and Netanyahu because they’re gumming up his glide path to the Nobel Peace Prize. But his criticisms don’t change the fact that the crises in both Ukraine and Gaza have gotten worse, not better, since he took office. Look, I’m glad that he’s flip-flopped on aid to Ukraine. But still, it’s a flip-flop. I remember when Republicans thought flip-flopping on a matter of war and peace was a sign of weakness. So that’s number one. He has either (1) executed his policies as promised, but people hate them, or (2) blown them off or reversed himself, exposing his campaign statements as nonsense. That the Harris campaign couldn’t figure out how to mock his obvious bullshit—don’t get me started. One thing I’m not celebrating this summer is Kamala Harris’s reemergence on the public stage, and I pray she’s not delusional enough to think she ought to run again in 2028. Number two is also simple. He’s a sleazeball, and more and more people are finally coming to realize it. The Jeffrey Epstein matter is Exhibit A, of course, but there is much more. The way he and his family are getting rich from the presidency is just obscene. Have you ever gone to TrumpStore.com? If not, have a look. It’s relentlessly garish, of course, but more than that, it’s relentlessly and proudly, defiantly overpriced. Yet these idiots buy this crap by the millions. But it’s Epstein that is catching up with him. And that story is a long, long way from being over. We cannot of course at this point state that Trump is guilty of anything. But allegations are out there. Have you read the testimony of “Katie Johnson”? You might want to familiarize yourself with it. Obviously, I have no idea whether it’s true. If a third of it is, and it’s ever corroborated, it will be by far the biggest presidential scandal of all time. And even if none of it is true, we’re still dealing with a president of the United States whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist. Let that sink in. Again, why the Democrats couldn’t make this an issue last year—aarrgh. I know. I’m sure they have all kinds of reasons. But you know what? If Donald Trump were running against someone whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist, he’d have made sure America knew. In any case, they’re figuring it out now. And if he pardons Ghislaine Maxwell or commutes her sentence or anything like that, millions of Americans will jump to the obvious conclusion. It all leaves Bryan Steil and his GOP congressional colleagues ducking their constituents, because God forbid they have to explain to voters why they voted for a sick bill that punishes working people and lines the pockets of the megarich and will shove many billions of dollars into the creation of a police state no one wants. That would be accountability, which would be uncomfortably close to democracy. Can’t have that.

Title: Walking, talking humanoid robots are coming to society in 4-5 years: WEF

Humanoid robots will be walking and talking among us in the next four or five years, according to a discussion on tech regulation at the World Economic Forum (WEF). The joint WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity concluded on October 16, with discussions ranging from neurotech to food liberation and tech regulation. Speaking during the panel called “Regulation: Friend or Foe?” SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary said that humanoid robots would be entering society by 2030. “Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT […] That’s only four-to-five years away”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 "Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT.. That's only 4-5 years away": SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary WEF Global Future Councils & Cybersecurity Meetings #AMGFCC25 https://t.co/Wj69Ccq95q pic.twitter.com/lpjkOPo2ua “This is going to be a very big shock to the system as we now have them [humanoid robots] enter into society. That’s only four or five years away“Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 “Right now in this room, as far as I know, we are all human, but four or five years from now at this very room when we have a global leadership futures council of the WEF in the UAE, we’re going to have humanoid robots in this room,” said Hidary. “They’ll be robots; they’ll be sitting in a chair; they’ll be taking notes, or doing other things, and we’re going to have to grapple with this as governments, as regulators, and as companies,” he added. One of the positives of having humanoid robots in society, according to Hidary, is that they are going to take care of the elderly in their own homes, so they don’t have to go to nursing homes. “As people get older, instead of having them go to a nursing home or other kinds of places, they can stay in their homes; they can be cared for by a robot”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 “As people get older, instead of having them go to a nursing home or other kinds of places, they can stay in their homes. They can be cared for by a robot,” said Hidary. “I think we all think this is a very positive thing.” While robots looking after the elderly may be viewed as a positive thing, especially for those without family members, it does eliminate the human connection that people may crave. Let’s just hope it doesn’t turn into a dystopian sci-fi scenario like in the Netflix series “Cassandra” where the robot caregiver called Cassandra has some rather horrifying abandonment issues that lead to quite nefarious outcomes. Dystopian or not, Hidary said that “Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT that we’ve now engaged with. “This is going to be a very big shock to the system as we now have them enter into society. That’s only four or five years away.” As far as which country will be best equipped to manage and integrate robots into society, Hidary made the case for Japan. “Japan I predict will be one of the society’s that best uses robots […] Because they have an aging society […] They see robots as part of the solution, not as a danger”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 "Japan I predict will be one of the society's that best uses robots.. Because they have an aging society.. they see robots as part of the solution, not as a danger" SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary WEF Global Future Councils & Cybersecurity Meetings #AMGFCC25 https://t.co/Wj69Ccq95q pic.twitter.com/bYGOxTrZv2 Hidary praised Japan for preparing for the coming robots over the past 40 years while putting in place “regulations that make sure that robots are safe.” The SandboxAQ CEO’s words echo those of WEF interim co-chair and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink when he spoke at the 2024 WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth, and Energy Development. There, Fink argued that developed countries with shrinking populations would be better prepared for the social problems that come from “substituting humans for machines.” “I can argue in the developed countries the big winners are countries that have shrinking populations […] These countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology […] The social problems that one will have in substituting humans for machines is going to be far easier in those countries that have declining populations”Larry Fink, WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth, and Energy Development, April 2024 Larry Fink tells the WEF depopulation is a good thing. "In developed countries the big winners are those with shrinking populations.. They'll rapidly develop robotics/AI.. transform productivity.. elevate living standards.. substitute humans for machines" https://t.co/iPDzO9wyDw pic.twitter.com/0Xrw2grWFp “We always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative growth, but in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries that have xenophobic immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in, shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology,” said Fink in April, 2024. “And if the promise, and it’s going to happen, if the promise of all of that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will, we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living of countries, the standard of living of individuals, even with shrinking populations,” he added. While Fink didn’t mention Japan directly, his words align with those of Hidary about robotics and aging populations. Going back to what Hidary said about humanoid robots entering society in four or five years, what will it take to get there? We can look to the 2025 WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, aka “Summer Davos” for some insights. On June 24, 2025, University of Twente professor Vanessa Evers explained that a digital twin of the entire world would be required to achieve “true robot intelligence.” “For true robot intelligence, you need to build a model of the world, like a digital twin of the entire world”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 "For true ROBOT INTELLIGENCE, you need to build a model of the world, like a DIGITAL TWIN OF THE ENTIRE WORLD.. We can add SUPERHUMAN CAPABILITIES [listen to your heart, watch your breath to detect stress & pain]" Vanessa Evers, WEF Summer Davos #AMNC25 https://t.co/2U3dFg5CP0 pic.twitter.com/0jPjGG6HpD “We could add superhuman capabilities, listen to the heartbeat or watch the breath of a person to know stress, to know pain. We can detect dominance, aggression, creative flow — there’s all things you could detect in an automated way”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 Creating a digital twin of the entire world is an extremely complex undertaking that goes way beyond Large Language Models like ChatGPT. In order to achieve true robot intelligence, a Large Behavioral Model would be needed to access and process enormous data from real world phenomena, which is far more complicated than creating and feeding Large Language Models. “ChatGPT has to choose from 26 characters. What is the best next character? But what about the real world? Imagine vision alone and we don’t have hearing, touch, taste, everything like that — just seeing stuff — if you would freeze-frame and then predict what is the next thing that’s going to happen in the visual, it would be impossible to know at the pixel level”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 "In theory it would be possible to train a robot like a LLM, but then a Large Behavioral Model – to use a lot of data from the real world & have it predict the next best action" Professor Vanessa Evers, "Social Robots and I" WEF Summer Davos #AMNC25 https://t.co/2U3dFg54Zs pic.twitter.com/AELHRvffQO According to Evers, “In theory it would be possible to train a robot like a Large Language Model, but then a Large Behavioral Model — to use a lot of data from the real world and have it predict the next best action. “A Large Language Model predicts what is the next best token, but of course that is super complicated in the real world.“ Getting back to Hidary, he believes, that through periodic meetings between stakeholders, humanoid robot regulation should have the capacity to update itself. He said, “One way to make sure there’s a level playing field for all players in the field is for the government to convene the players, to listen to them, and to keep a process that in the regulation itself, it says, every six months or something like that, there should be a convening of the key stakeholders, and we shall update it. “Put that into the regulation itself to recognize that any robot law we say today is irrelevant four or five years from now, and that law four or five years from now is irrelevant 10 years from now.” “Let’s build in the ability to update itself into the very regulation itself.” The special joint session of the WEF “Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils and the Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity” convened more than 500 experts from business, government, civil society, academia and media, alongside 150 of the world’s foremost cybersecurity leaders from October 14-16 in Dubai, UAE.

A SECOND MAN has been found guilty of the murder of a man whose skeletonised remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan in East Cork last year. Kieran Quilligan (47) from Togher in Cork was last seen alive on 1 September 2023. He was missing for five months when his remains were detected on 29 January 2024 after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to scrubland in the county. The jury of ten men and two women at the Central Criminal Court in Cork heard that he had been beaten with a hammer like weapon. Mr Quilligan suffered multiple bone fractures. However, an exact cause of death could not be determined because of the decomposition of organs. The jury spent close to six hours deliberating before today finding Luke Taylor (27) previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork guilty of murder. His co accused Niall Long (33) formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork was yesterday found guilty of the murder of Mr Quilligan. Justice Siobhan Lankford thanked the jurors for their diligent service and excused them from jury service for a period of ten years. Both men now face mandatory life sentences. Long and Taylor were remanded in custody for sentencing on 29 October next at 10.30am. Meanwhile, over the course of the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, noted that the jury had watched a “staggering amount” of CCTV with gardaí harvesting thousands of hours of footage. O’Sullivan also indicated that but for the incredible garda investigation the remains of Mr Quilligan might never have been found. In his opening speech to the jury O’Sullivan said that the “instigating factor” in the murder was an incident where Kieran Quilligan and another man allegedly stole drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. The jury heard that Mr Quilligan left his apartment in Cork later that evening with Luke Taylor telling his partner he would be back in a matter of minutes. Mr Quilligan was tracked walking to St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city alongside Luke Taylor. He never emerged from the lane. The Prosecution evidence was that a car was brought to the top of the lane and that Mr Quilligan was bundled in to the boot. Advertisement The car was tracked going to Little Island in Co Cork and subsequently heading to Rostellan where the remains of the deceased were found on 29 January 2024. In his closing speech to the jury, O’Sullivan said that Kieran Quilligan was “lured” to his death by Luke Taylor. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long “ambushed” him. He described the activities of the two men as a joint enterprise. The jury also heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem on the remains of Mr Quilligan. Dr Bolster made an examination of the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine off a roadway where there was a jute grave. Underneath this was another jute gravel bag with a “pelvic bone protruding.” Dr Bolster said she could see ribs and a skull with a “bag around it tied with a knot.” The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Dr Bolster noted a cable tie around the left ankle and right shin of the remains and two knotted pieces of plastic around the neck. She said that they were likely to have been used for the purposes of moving the body. Dr Bolster said that the injuries sustained by Mr Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault in a laneway.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, chest, leg and hand bones, jaw bones, neck and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. In the course of the trial the jury heard evidence from Garda James Byrd who said that on 8 September 2023 Luke Taylor called to Anglesea Street Garda Station. He said that he was “concerned for the welfare of his friend and wanted to assist gardaí.” He informed gardaí that he had been in the company of Quilligan on the night he was last seen but that they had parted ways in Cork city centre. The trial also heard evidence from Det Garda Anne O’Sullivan who said that in March of 2024 Luke Taylor sent a text to his girlfriend saying that this man Quilligan “was killed in an unknown place unknown time.” He further stated “I’m not the person that was robbed. I had nothing to do with that.” In the text exchange Taylor insisted that his only involvement was that he bought drugs off Niall Long. He also texted “they’re trying to put me in the mix.” The jurors also heard evidence from Sgt Maurice O’Connor. He said that Niall Long had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September 2023. She texted him saying that her jeep smelled of Dettol. Sgt O’Connor said that Long texted his mother. In his reply he stated that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Create an email alert based on the current article

A second man has been found guilty of the murder of a man who was bludgeoned to death and dumped in scrub land following a row over the robbery and theft of drugs and cash in Cork City. Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, had denied the murder of Kieran Quilligan (47) on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th, 2024, when he was arraigned at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork earlier this month. On Friday afternoon, the jury of 10 men and two women returned after five hours and 44 minutes of deliberations and found Taylor guilty of the murder of Mr Quilligan, whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was murdered by Taylor and co-accused Niall Long. Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford remanded both Taylor and Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, in custody for sentence on October 29th when the court will hear victim impact statements from the Quiligan family. Long was convicted on Thursday of the murder. During the trial, the jury heard Mr Quilligan’s murder had its origins in an incident where he and another man robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork City on September 1st, 2023. Mr Quilligan disappeared later that day. The deceased man’s partner Colette O’Driscoll said the last time she saw her partner was when he left their apartment at Riverview on Anderson’s Quay in Cork City centre, accompanied by Taylor, shortly before 9pm on the night of September 1st, 2023. When he failed to return home, she reported him missing to An Garda Síochána three days later on September 4th. She said she reported Mr Quilligan’s disappearance because she was starting to hear rumours. When she met Luke Taylor in town some days later he said he didn’t know what happened to Mr Quilligan, as he had left him at Morrison’s Island on September 1st. The jury heard gardaí tracked Mr Quilligan on CCTV walking with Taylor up the quays in Cork City to St Finbar’s Place. He went up some steps near St Fin Barre’s Cathedral but there was no sign of him ever emerging at the top of the steps on to Fort Street. They heard evidence a white Toyota Rav 4, registered to Long’s mother Janice, was seen entering Fort Street and reversing into the steps at the top of St Finbarr’s Place. It left the area and drove to Little Island in east Cork. They were shown CCTV footage of the same vehicle calling to the Rochestown Park Hotel in Cork on September 4th, where Taylor got in.It again headed towards Rostellan in east Cork where Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains were found on January 29th, 2024. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster said she was unable to say exactly when Mr Quilligan had died or give a precise cause of death, due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem which had resulted in the decay and disappearance of all soft tissue and organs. Dr Bolster said it was clear Mr Quilligan had been the victim of a serious assault, as he had suffered numerous injuries, including fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jawbone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. She said several of the fractures suggested a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer. Dr Sarah Fleming of Forensic Science Ireland said blood stains found in the boot of the Toyota Rav 4 provided a DNA match with Mr Quilligan.

A second man has been found guilty of the murder of a 47-year-old man whose remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan, in Cork, last year. Luke Taylor, aged 27, with an address at Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, in Cork, was found guilty by a jury this morning. His co-accused, 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, in Mahon, in Cork, was yesterday also found guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan. Mr Quilligan, 47, from Togher in Cork, was last seen alive on 1 September 2023. He was missing for five months when his remains were discovered on 29 January 2024, after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to search an area of scrubland. The Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork heard that he had been beaten with a hammer like weapon. Mr Quilligan suffered multiple bone fractures. However, an exact cause of death could not be determined because of the decomposition of the body. Both men now face mandatory life sentences and were remanded in custody for sentencing on 29 October. In his closing speech to the jury, prosecution senior counsel Donal O'Sullivan said that Mr Quilligan was "lured" to his death. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr's Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long "ambushed" him. Mr O'Sullivan said that the men then threw Mr Quilligan in to the boot of a car. He said that the "instigating factor" in relation to what occurred involved Mr Quilligan stealing drugs from Long earlier that day. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: JPMorgan Chase to start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum as loan collateral: report

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly preparing to let institutional clients use BTC and ETH as collateral for loans by the end of the year, as per a Bloomberg report. The move marks one of the most significant steps yet by a major US bank toward integrating digital assets into traditional finance, signalling how fast cryptocurrencies are moving from the periphery to the core of global banking. For years, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was one of the fiercest critics of Bitcoin, calling it a “decentralised Ponzi scheme” and claiming that only criminals used it. Dimon’s comments often shaped how Wall Street viewed the cryptocurrency market. But Dimon’s tone has softened in recent years, especially since Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, which brought regulatory changes that have made it easier for banks to engage with digital assets. Now, Dimon’s JPMorgan is taking a major step that would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. The bank’s new program will reportedly allow institutional clients to pledge their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings as collateral for loans. The assets will be held by a third-party custodian, ensuring compliance with existing financial and regulatory standards. Speculation about JPMorgan’s crypto-collateral plans first emerged earlier this year when the Financial Times reported that the bank was exploring such a move, potentially by 2026. At the time, scepticism ran high. Dimon’s long record of dismissing Bitcoin, combined with banks’ cautious approach to regulatory uncertainty, made the plan seem remote. However, the landscape has changed rapidly in 2025. With Bitcoin trading above $111,000 and Ethereum nearing $4,000, the digital asset market has reached unprecedented maturity and capitalisation. Bitcoin’s market cap has surged to over $2.2 trillion, while Ethereum’s market cap has climbed to nearly $478 billion. The rise in these asset prices, combined with increased institutional demand, has made cryptocurrencies more appealing as loan collateral. JPMorgan’s initiative will expand on its earlier decision to accept crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral. JPMorgan’s shift mirrors a broader transformation across the financial sector. Morgan Stanley plans to open cryptocurrency access to retail investors through its E*Trade platform in the first half of next year. State Street, BNY Mellon, and Fidelity are all expanding their digital asset custody services, while BlackRock recently introduced new mechanisms allowing investors to convert Bitcoin directly into ETF holdings. Even long-time sceptics like Standard Chartered have revised their stance, recognising the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in global finance. These moves indicate that digital assets are no longer being viewed as speculative outliers but as legitimate components of diversified financial systems.

Title: DAS London 2025: Keep Calm And Carry On Trading Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/10/24/das-london-2025-keep-calm-and-carry-on-trading-crypto/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. The autumn conference season in the U.K. continued last week with Blockwork’s Digital Asset Summit (DAS) London 2025 leaving its indelible mark on the city. With over 150 speakers, 2,500 attendees, 45 sessions, the three-day summit is at the crossroads of TradFi and Defi and focused on topics like institutional crypto adoption, ETFs, tokenization, stablecoins, and regulatory frameworks. It was a suit with no tie meets hoodies event with no dinosaurs. Speakers included a blend of TradFi and DeFi rockstars including, Matt Kunke – Blackrock, Mathew McDermott - Goldman Sachs, Jeffrey Kendrick - Standard Chartered, Danny Masters - Coinshares, Simon Taylor - Tempo, Catherine Chen – Binance, Chuck Mounts – S&P Global, Mark Jennings – Gemini, Laura Navaratnam – Crypto Council for Innovation, Dan Morehead – Pantera, Sandy Kaul – Templeton, Mara Schmiedt - Alluvial, Dave Cunningham – Citi, Samantha Bohbot - RockawayX, Victor Jung – Hamilton Lane, Ryan Hayward - Barclays , Peter Left – Lloyds, Matt Hougan – Bitwise, Antaoly Crachilov – Nickel, Chris Tyrer – Bullish, Baron Holmes of Richmond - U.K. House of Lords, and many more HERE. Nigel Farage, U.K, Reform MP, was the keynote politco speaker and claims he was on his best behavior meeting the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, a few weeks ago and chimed in on the bank’s proposed individual stablecoin limits, making the point that limits were not required and only referring to Bailey as a dinosaur once during the meeting. DAS London’s big takeaway was, “The integration is further deepening at the crossroads of TradFi and DeFi.” Mark Jennings, Gemini's head of Europe, said, “DAS has shown that the demand is there to integrate digital assets into traditional finance, whether that's holding bitcoin in their treasuries, trading derivatives or accessing DATs. “This is certainly fueled by the regulatory clarity from the first pro-crypto U.S. Administration, the implementation of MiCA in Europe, and the regulatory roadmap outlined by the U.K. government in their ambitions to become a global crypto hub. The big talk at the summit was of the previous Friday’s crypto flash crash where over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out within hours. The liquidations were nine times larger than any previous single-day total, marking the largest deleveraging in market history. Insights VC notes bitcoin fell about 14% from $122,000 to $105,000 and Ether dropped 12% to $3,436. Major altcoins saw extreme intraday losses with Solana falling over 40% at one point, Toncoin briefly trading at $0.50 (−80%), and Worldcoin loosing 70% of its value before partial rebounds. Uber analyst, Blockworks Byron Gilliam in his daily mail The Breakdown, elegantly walked us through “auto-deleveraging” (ADL), when leveraged crypto options or “perps” on the wrong side of the trade unwind at such a velocity, margin rapidly deteriorates, and liquidity dries up resulting in ADL liquidating positions on the right side of the trade. Notes Gilliam, “Sometimes, however, no one has any margin left, so there’s no one to sell a losing position to. In that case, the only thing left to do is close the seller’s bet as well, because the game is over, for everyone. Closing a winning bet is called “auto-deleveraging” (ADL) and it’s what caused nearly all of crypto to crash on Friday. “You and I are not the only ones who had never heard of it [ADL] before then. ADL is a way of kicking people off the perps market” and refers to Doug Colkitt’s comments to Empire, “It happens infrequently enough that even seasoned perps traders are often barely aware of it.” The pithy Gilliam quotes Gordon Gekko on markets, “It’s a zero-sum game. Somebody wins, somebody loses. Money isn’t lost or made, it’s simply transferred.” Arguably, with ADL kicking in, everyone is a loser. On a positive note, by the start of DAS on Monday, many crypto prices were recovering with bitcoin hitting $115,000 and finding support around $110,000 for the week. Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founder of the crypto fund Nickel Digital Asset Management, noted in his DAS panel that his fund endured the market stress event quite well and even ended the weekend positive. “I think this reflects the important saturation of the industry where more and more sophisticated pod shops like Nickel will enter the crypto market and the market structure will mature significantly, said Felix Jauvlin, on The Breakdown daily mail, filling in for Gilliam. While a number of centralized crypto exchanges experienced outages and delays, Hyperliquid, an on-chain perp DEX, saw over $10 billion of positions force-closed, the highest of any venue, as its transparent on-chain engine liquidated positions to avoid any bad debt, triggering its first ADL event in over two years. Adds Jennings, “Whilst DAS’s timing was shortly after the market downturn experienced on Friday, volatility is one aspect that comes along with the crypto market, bringing both opportunity and risk for investors. “Nevertheless, reliability is a key function that builds trust on centralized exchanges, and we have many guardrails in place to ensure we can offer the same market execution and functionality that our customers depend on, regardless of market conditions, which is what institutions expect.” Elise Soucie, executive director of Global Digital Finance, called in her analysis of the crypto crash to the Bloomberg Opening Trade from DC Fintech Week, “This is not actually a crypto specific event, it is a policy-induced crypto liquidation cascade in a market already nervous about the dollar, interest rates, the private credit market, and the deficit.” Soucie notes that it was not until Trump’s Truth social posts on Chinese tariffs at 4:30 in the afternoon on Friday that the crypto market, which was already selling off and in decline on Friday, went into a liquidation cascade. The crypto crash was as big a discussion focal point during DC Fintech Week as it was at DAS London, especially in the policy community - market analysts and traders should take note, with crypto trading 24/7/365, it looks like the new canary in the coal mine for headlines for market reactions to emerging policy and macroeconomic uncertainty. Crypto market infrastructure builders now have their head buried in work, as always after a volatile event with unintended consequences, and are focused on building the next generation of market circuit breakers and liquidity lifelines to avoid the future ADL of positions that are in the money. Nothing exemplifies the TradFi DeFi crossroads as well as the strategic partnership announced between S&P and Chainlink to deliver S&Ps Stablecoin Stability Assessments (SSAs) on-chain. Chuck Mounts, chief DeFi officer at S&P Global said, "The launch of SSAs on-chain through Chainlink underscores our commitment to meeting our clients where they are. The collaboration provides real-time access to S&P’s comprehensive stablecoin evaluations, enhancing transparency and empowering investors with critical data within the evolving digital asset landscape. And how cool is it that financial institutions like S&P have a chief DeFi officer. Adds Mounts, "By making our SSAs available on-chain through Chainlink's proven oracle infrastructure, we're enabling market participants to access our assessments seamlessly using their existing DeFi infrastructure, enhancing transparency and informed decision-making across the DeFi landscape." Samantha Bohbot, partner and chief growth officer at RockwayX highlights, “Last week’s DAS conference highlighted what many industry insiders have known for quite some time: this cycle was marked by institutional adoption. This was underscored by the event’s attendees and topics of discussion. “Clear areas of industry growth were highlighted; for example, liquidity in on-chain private markets, but now that the industry is gaining institutional attention, there needs to be a shift towards further innovation. “Blockchain’s advantages for traditional finance have yet to be fully realized. One area that has drawn institutional interest is tokenization, and yet so far, tokenization has been simply taking what was there and putting it on-chain. The next cycle will be dictated by structured products that are blockchain native and uniquely on-chain, rather than copy and paste.” Mara Schmiedt, co-founder and ceo of Alluvial says, “RWA tokenization was a key DAS theme and discussion topic with issuer-led demand, institutional infrastructure readiness and regulatory clarity improving, Larry Fink's “tokenization as the future of financial markets” feels more real and tangible now. “DATs (Digital Asset Treasuries) were another subject of debate after amassing billions of dillars in the first half of this year, as public companies and treasurers pivot away from passive BTC holdings towards productive and stakeable assets including ETH, SOL and others. “Tons of chatter around Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as a new form of yield-bearing collateral supporting DeFi money legos and as a viable liquidity solution for ETFs given expanding ETH staking queues and with staking-enabled ETFs in the US (Grayscale leading) hitting the market this month.” Danny Masters, chairman of Coinshares, a European crypto ETP pioneer, had a message about its recent U.S. public markets debut that European markets should pay attention to: European markets under-value digital assets public companies. Masters didn’t move Coinshares to the U.S. market to raise money in the capital markets but rather to focus on achieving market multiples as high as 25x achieved by companies in Coinshare’s U.S. peer group, versus 2x in Europe. Masters is a poster child for the TradFi DeFi crossroads, like many former Tier 1 Wall Street traders who bring their capital markets experience to crypto to strengthen market conduct and deploy their own time and capital founding innovative businesses. At one of my Association dinners a few years back, Masters told the story of how his then European-based regulated investment management business dealing in crypto was being persecuted by a European regulator. In trying to do the right thing and work with regulators he was also personally persecuted – no respect. It is easy to understand the popularity of the U.S. Administration’s approach and why European fintech firms are flocking to the U.S. – you are a digital innovation hero in the US - respect. The final day three of DAS closed with a panel on Goldman Sachs play book with a perennial London conference favorite, Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs digital assets czar, in a fireside chat with Blockworks with Blockwork’s Michael Ippolito. No grey hair on this youthful 20-year GS veteran who looks like he could be starring in a Hollywood movie about Wall Street’s digital space race. McDermott points to the rise in stablecoins and tokenized money market funds that will drive greater collateral mobility, a killer app if not the holy grail in the TradFi and derivatives space. Watch the full panel session HERE. The final word goes to Lord Holmes, Baron Holmes of Richmond, MBE, the U.K.s digital champion in the House of Lords (U.K Upper House of Parliament). He could not have summarized DAS London 2025 better. "There's been great conversations at DAS and that's what we need more of,” said Holmes, “more conversations, connections, and public engagement for this digital asset space." My only disappointment with DAS London 2025 was not meeting Byron Gilliam, he didn’t make it to London - I was even wearing my Hermes tie! I’ll keep my fingers crossed for DAS NYC 2026.
