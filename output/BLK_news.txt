With huge stablecoin reserves and Futures trading volumes, there seems to be no competition at all. Binance has consistently maintained a dominant position in the crypto exchange landscape, with recent data highlighting its significant edge over competitors. From holding a commanding share of stablecoin reserves to leading the pack in Futures trading volumes, the exchange’s market presence continues to outpace other exchanges, Needless to say, these findings have simply reinforced Binance’s role as a key player in the crypto space. In today’s market, stablecoins remain the backbone of on-chain liquidity and trading efficiency – Providing price stability, reducing friction in capital movement, and serving as the default unit of account for traders worldwide. As of March 2025, Binance holds a staggering 66% share of stablecoin reserves among major exchanges, far outpacing rivals like OKX, Bitget, and Bybit. In fact, according to CryptoQuant data, Binance’s reserve-to-market cap ratio has climbed steadily since late 2023, while competitors have seen their shares stagnate or decline. Source: CryptoQuant The data underlined this growing gap – Binance and Binance.US dominate over two-thirds of the stablecoin ecosystem on centralized exchanges, bolstering the exchange’s deep liquidity and investor confidence. With $31 billion in reserves, Binance benefits from strong user inflows and a robust institutional presence. Meanwhile, new stablecoin projects in 2025 – across Layer 1s, fintech startups, and even potential government initiatives – only deepen the exchange’s strategic grip on this rapidly expanding asset class. Binance remains the undisputed leader in stablecoin reserves, holding approximately $31 billion – More than double the combined reserves of OKX, Bybit, and Coinbase. The data revealed a dramatic hike in Binance’s stablecoin holdings since late 2024. This coincided with renewed retail inflows, ETF-driven market optimism, and USDC’s resurgence after Circle’s January deal with BlackRock to expand tokenized treasuries. Source: Cryptoquant While Binance.US also saw some steady growth, competitors like Bitget and Kraken may appear dwarfed in comparison. Binance’s dominance stems from its deep liquidity pools, low-fee structure, and aggressive market-making programs that attract both institutional and retail users. Additionally, its early integration of stablecoins like FDUSD and TUSD as zero-fee trading pairs has kept volumes high. With new Layer 1 ecosystems launching stablecoins, Binance continues to capture most of those inflows. In January 2025, Binance blew past competitors with a staggering $1.08 trillion in monthly Futures trading volume – Nearly doubling Bybit ($509 billion) and eclipsing Coinbase and OKX. While February and March saw a pullback to $717 billion and $498 billion, respectively, Binance still commands the Futures arena. Its lead stems from an unmatched combination of deep liquidity, product breadth, and accessibility for retail and institutional users alike. Source: Cryptoquant The exchange benefits from an intuitive interface, low trading fees, and advanced risk-management tools that cater to high-volume futures traders. In mid-January, Binance also delisted a series of cross and isolated margin pairs, a move that may have streamlined capital allocation and improved trading efficiency for institutional accounts. To put it simply, despite regulatory overhang in some regions, Binance’s global reach keeps it ahead of the curve in this high-stakes derivatives market.

Title: Ireland look to show strides they have made by upsetting France in Six Nations opener

It is a measure of the huge strides made by the Irish team compared to the corresponding first round game 12 months ago in Le Havre that Scott Bemand and his players are embracing much higher expectations of themselves. A year ago the Irish head coach spoke of firing a few shots at the French in that opening game, and succeeded to some extent with two tries in the last 10 minutes. Out of little acorns and all that. Now, having won five of their last seven games, including victories over Australia and New Zealand this season, they expect to be competitive against France and believe they can beat opponents whom Ireland have only overcome three times in 32 previous meetings. Bemand accepts that this year is the tougher schedule, with the big two of France and England (who have finished first and second since 2017) at home whereas they are away to their Celtic and Italian rivals. Yet in insisting they have to move their game further forward in this 2025 Six Nations, Bemand went so far as to say: “We’re hungry to close the gap on the monopoly held by England and France to a degree. They’ve always been the top two in the Six Nations for a good while.” Recalling last year’s Six Nations, Bemand said: “We were able to spend time developing our game, becoming harder to beat, sorting our set-piece out, getting more tries on the board, scoring against France for the first time in three years, scoring against England for the first time in I don’t know how long. “There’s little moments in games that we’ve been able to build. When we went to WXV1, we got more of those moments. We were more in games to the point that we beat a Tier One nation and secondly we were disappointed to lose to Canada. “France are no mugs. France are a very good team, incredibly talented group. Last World Cup they were a kick away from being in the final against the Red Roses. They’re a good group but we believe we’re going to cause more problems this time. We’re going to be a harder team to beat. “Coming out of this fixture on the weekend, this could very well be a quarter-final in a World Cup. So we want to come out of this knowing we can beat them, whether that means beating them or whether that means we’ve got the game to beat them. And by the time we get to a World Cup hopefully, it’s the next step on from whatever we achieve in this Six Nations.” Ireland retain only seven of the starting XV from last year’s 38-17 defeat to the French, while Les Bleus also retain just seven as Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz make six changes to the French side compared to their last outing, a 39-14 defeat to a New Zealand side which Ireland had beaten 29-17 in the WXV1 last autumn, which suggests the gap has closed further this season. “They’ve had a relatively tough WXV1, and they said they’re reviewed hard,” said Bemand. “Bringing them to our shores gives us a great opportunity to test ourselves.” Still, the centre partnership of Gabrielle Vernier and Nassira Konde remains intact, while inside them Carla Arbez will make her first appearance for France since November 2023 and alongside the heartbeat of their team, the 61-times capped Toulouse scrumhalf Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Ireland perhaps exceeded expectations slightly last season with a third-place finish to secure qualification for both the WXV1 and the World Cup later this year. Although results and the schedule fell their way, they made the most of their luck and have benefited from competing against more elite teams in WXV1. “Getting the same position again is harder to do this year,” admitted Bemand. “So, if we came third, and we win three games, we’ve done better than we did this year. We also want to stretch ourselves. We’re targeting trying to close that gap on the top two, we want to become World Cup contenders. At some point, we got to take some chunks out of a Tier One nation and for us that’s doing something against a France or an England. With the successful reintroduction of the Sevens players, this Irish team has more firepower and more of a cutting edge than the side which lost to France a year ago. Brittany Hogan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer give them more go-forward carrying, Dannah O’Brien brings a strong kicking game and with Stacey Flood hitting the line, Amee-Leigh Costigan’s head-to-head with her French counterpart as captain and winger, Marine Menager, could be worth the admission money alone. France have usually brought more power and pace to this fixture but Bemand is an astute user of his replacements, and has opted for a 6-2 split in the belief that the benches will go some way toward determining the outcome. If Ireland are still in the mix at that stage, then anything is possible.

Title: Dollar-pegged stablecoins are a hedge against volatility

Institutional interests soar as market uncertainty highlights the role of stablecoins in navigating economic pressures. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Maksym Sakharov, Co-Founder & Group CEO of WeFi. The current markets are experiencing tailwinds due to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration and retaliatory measures from trading partners. So far, however, the market proponents are saying that Trump’s tariffs are primarily a negotiation strategy, and their effect on businesses and consumers will remain manageable. Adding to uncertainty are the inflationary pressures that could challenge the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting outlook as inflation is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Besides that, an impending fiscal debate in Washington over the federal budget is also causing jitters in the market. Resolving the debt ceiling remains a pressing issue, as the Treasury is currently relying on “extraordinary measures” to meet U.S. financial obligations. The exact timeline for when these measures will be exhausted is unclear, but analysts anticipate they may run out after the first quarter. While the administration has proposed eliminating the debt ceiling, this could face resistance from fiscal conservatives in Congress. Despite these macroeconomic uncertainty, one sector that is experiencing steady growth is stablecoins, according to a recent report. Much of the volume is driven by flows in USDT and USDC. Stablecoins started as an experiment – a programmable digital currency that would make it easier for users to enter the crypto market and trade different digital assets. A decade later, they are a critical part of the wider digital financial infrastructure. At present, the stablecoin market cap stands at a record $226 billion and continues to expand. Demand in emerging markets drives this growth. According to a recent Ark Invest report, Dollar-pegged stablecoins are dominating the market. They account for over 98% of the stablecoin supply, with Gold and Euro-backed stablecoins only sharing a small portion of the market. In addition to this, Tether’s USDT accounts for over 60% of the total market. ARK’s research suggests that the market will expand and include Asian currency-backed stablecoins. Besides that, digital assets are going through a shift marked by “stablecoinization” and “dollarization.” Asian nations like China and Japan have offloaded record amounts of US Treasuries. Saudi Arabia has ended its 45-year petrodollar agreement, and BRICS nations are increasingly bypassing the SWIFT network to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Traditionally, Bitcoin and Ether served as the primary entry points into the digital asset ecosystem. However, over the past two years, stablecoins have taken the lead, now representing 35% to 50% of on-chain transaction volumes. Despite global regulatory headwinds, emerging markets have been adopting stablecoins. In Brazil, 90% of crypto transactions are done via stablecoins, primarily used for international purchases. A Visa report ranks Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil as the most active stablecoin markets, and Argentina ranks second in stablecoin holdings. Additionally, 6 out of every 10 purchases in the country were made using stablecoins pegged to the dollar, with near parity between USDC and USDT. This shift towards stablecoins in Argentina is driven by high inflation and the need to protect against the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Clearly, in countries with unstable currencies, people turn to stablecoins such as USDT to safeguard their wealth. In addition to making cross-border transactions easier, this adoption offers a hedge against local currency volatility. This signals a serious challenge to outdated financial systems. Analysts predict that the 2025 stablecoin boom will push market capitalization to $400 billion or more. Projections suggest that stablecoins could reach a market cap of $3 trillion over the next five years. Most importantly, financial institutions are joining this trend. Stripe recently completed a $1 billion acquisition of Bridge, a startup that builds stablecoin infrastructure. Traditional banks such as BBVA plan to launch their own stablecoins by the end of 2025. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller described stablecoins as an important innovation. He stated that digital currencies can cut reliance on payment intermediaries, lower global costs, and improve efficiency. Last year, commerce nominee Howard Lutnick said stablecoins help support the dollar. Major Wall Street players like Bank of America, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, CBOE, Charles Schwab, and Citi are investing in the sector. Their participation signals that stablecoins are set to transform global payments. The trend is clear: stablecoins are no longer a crypto experiment — they are becoming a core part of financial infrastructure in emerging markets to move money globally. As adoption accelerates, the question is not if stablecoins will transform payments but how quickly they will stand alongside — or even replace — outdated financial systems.

Title: The Routledge Companion to 21st-century Irish Writing: academics deliver hefty report from the coalface on the state of our culture
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/review/2025/03/22/the-routledge-companion-to-21st-century-irish-writing-academics-deliver-hefty-report-from-the-coalface-on-the-state-of-our-culture/
Time Published: 2025-03-22T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
The problem with a great deal of academic writing comes down to one word: hedging. I don’t know why the mark of intellection should have become the refusal boldly to advance a claim. The following is a parody, but it gets at what I mean: “Certain discourses of embodiedness can, even if we take into account the various persuasive critiques of the very word ‘embodiedness’ advanced by Theorist, Thinker and Frenchman, be understood as suggesting the possible formulation of spaces in which the body might be thought anew.” Possible. Might. Take into account. The eyes of the non-academic reader glaze over. Why not just say what you think? I don’t mean to mock. I’m an academic myself. I’ve had my own tussles with Theorist, Thinker and Frenchman. But it seems to me that we are now at a point in history when academic critics of culture need to start saying what they mean as clearly as they can. Social media hourly pours its effluent into the river of truth. Most of our rulers no longer bother to pretend they’re not lying. “The zone,” in Steve Bannon’s sinister formulation, is being “flooded” – flooded, that is, with bulls**t intended to distract. Academics, particularly liberal and left-wing academics, can no longer afford to hedge. They need to stop talking to each other and start talking to the world – if it will listen. These thoughts are provoked, somewhat indirectly, by a reading of The Routledge Companion to 21st-century Irish Writing, a huge, various and stimulating anthology of academic essays on contemporary Irish culture assembled by Anne Fogarty (who teaches at UCD) and Eugene O’Brien (who teaches at Mary Immaculate College, Limerick). Editing such a book is a heroic endeavour. There are 35 essays here, each one fearsomely accoutred with endnotes, references, in-line citations. (A parenthetical suggestion to academics: if you want to hedge, hedge in the endnotes. That’s what they’re for.) Getting that many academics to pull together is, proverbially, like herding cats. But Fogarty and O’Brien are expert cat-herders. They have produced an important book. It is not, alas, priced for civilian readers: £215 for the hardback. Academic publishing is badly in need of reform. But that’s another story. The Routledge Companion is important because what has characterised 21st-century Ireland is change and because we need all the help we can muster if we want to think about this change and what it means. I was born in 1981, which means I have lived through radical social transformations that show no sign of stopping: the end of Catholic theocracy, the erosion of Civil War politics, the neoliberalisation of the economy, the growth of the middle class, the ambiguous aftermath of the Troubles, net immigration, housing crisis, climate change, racial diversity, the first ugly shoots of a far-right politics. To live in 21st-century Ireland is to live in uncertainty. What country, friends, is this? Then again, it is hard to think about the present. In their introduction, Fogarty and O’Brien observe that “to read the contemporary is a vexed matter and not as smooth as presupposed”. Well, quite. Kierkegaard is often quoted to the effect that life must be lived forwards, but can only be understood backwards, though he didn’t quite say this. What he did say was that, time-bound as we are, there can be no static point from which to understand your life at all. (Tough break.) [ The 100 best Irish books of the 21st century: how we made the list and what it says about the state of Irish fictionOpens in new window ] The editors know that this applies to history and culture too. Their response is to construe the present as a historical moment like any other – as knowable as the past, and (crucially) as unknowable. “The present may seem to be the area of cultural production that we should know best,” they write, “but, in fact, it is one that faces us with as many questions, problems and conundrums as the study of any other historical eras.” To study the contemporary, they note, is to experience a “sense of estrangement”. But such a sense of estrangement is enormously useful. The estranged mind – that is, the critic’s mind – is like the cow in the Gary Larson Far Side cartoon who looks up suddenly and says, “Hey, wait a minute! This is grass! We’ve been eating grass!” We need that cow. Otherwise, we’re just chewing the cud. So, what kind of grass have we been eating? Note carefully the title: not “21st-century Irish Literature” but “21st-century Irish Writing”. There are four big sections. The first looks at prose, and includes, among other pieces, Liam Lanigan’s essay Counterfactual Geographies on Paul Murray’s The Mark and the Void (2015); Eamon Maher on Representations of Catholicism in Contemporary Irish Fiction; María Amor Barros-del Rio on The Ethics of Care in Sally Rooney’s Novels; and Anne Fogarty on Animals in Short Stories by Contemporary Irish Women Writers. Part Two looks at poetry – it’s called A Poetics of the Unfinished and the Transformative, suggesting two perspectives through which not just contemporary Irish poetry, but contemporary Ireland itself, can be understood. This section includes an illuminating and passionate survey of contemporary Irish queer poetry by Kit Fryatt, and an essay by the always-interesting Eoin Flannery on Contemporary Irish Ecopoetics, which stresses the ethical subversions made possible by an ecopoetic approach. The third section looks at theatre and it reminds us that the stage is generally where we go, in Ireland, when we want to think about class (otherwise our great unspoken subject). There are long reflections on the work of THISISPOPBABY (by Martin Kenny and Miriam Haughton), on ethnotheatre in Northern Ireland (by Lisa Fitzpatrick), and on post-2008 working-class theatre (this is a contribution from an early-career scholar, Clara Mallon, who is to be commended: we need more, we always need more, honest and perceptive writing about class in Ireland). Part four is New Voices, New Forms, New Modes of Material Production. It includes Irish Fantasy Fiction in the 21st-century by that one-man crusade for Irish genre studies, Jack Fennell; Molly Slavin on Global Irish Crime Fiction in the 21st-century; and Claire Lynch on The Personal Essay and life-writing more broadly. The final section also moves beyond the textual to look at how and where texts are published (this is a big trend right now, in literary studies). Thus, a pair of essays on literary journals: Elke D’hoker on The Stinging Fly and its preferred modes of short fiction, and Liam Harrison on the journal scene as such. The last piece in the book is Languages and Publishing in Contemporary Irish Writing by Tim Groenland and Margaret Kelleher, which thinks carefully about the conditions at present influencing translation, publishing initiatives and arts funding in Ireland. To say it’s a mixed bag is to miss the point: it’s supposed to be a mixed bag. The editors are clear about this. What they sought to assemble, they say, was a collection of “critical readings at the coalface of 21st-century writing that reflect on, theorise and tease out current cultural momentums, energies and blockages”. The book was “conceived of as initial soundings in our current moment rather than a sweeping or definitive set of overviews”. One of criticism’s jobs is to do aesthetic triage on the busy waiting room of contemporary art – to attempt to distinguish, in other words, the good from the bad, and the good from the great. The Routledge Companion doesn’t really do this. What I mean is it lets in a lot of bad art and leaves out a lot of good. Its contributors now and then expend their intellects on works that really aren’t worth it. But this is to be expected from a book that is essentially an interim report – a collective dispatch from, as the editors say, “the coalface”. (Putting it this way makes art and culture sound like not much fun, actually. But we’ve all done our bit at the fringe plays and the poetry readings. We get it.) The great value of such a book, produced by diverse hands, is that it allows you to gain precisely what none of its individual contributors pretend to offer: a synoptic, or near-synoptic, overview of Ireland in the 21st century. What’s the “TL;DR”? Catholicism: creeping in again through the back door. (They haven’t gone away, you know.) We need to fund more translators. The exciting emergence of non-white Irish artists. There is a general and rather bewildered sense of destabilisation, of shifting ground. Several contributors cite Zygmunt Bauman’s notion of “liquid modernity”: the idea that a computer-based, financialised global economy has severed us from the old “heavy” ties of community; now we float free, and lost. We are living through a time of (as the title of one essay has it) “epochal change”. Interestingly, the editors note that “older paradigms and theoretical lenses like postcolonialism seem no longer to have purchase”. They mean in universities, but the insight holds good more generally. It must be 10 years or more since I last heard anyone blame our colonial past for some quirk of the Irish psyche. Are we post-postcolonial, at last? Huge, if true. Ah, but what about that other empire, now messily expiring on the other side of the Atlantic? A reckoning with Ireland in the age of US cultural hegemony is conspicuously absent from this book. But it might be too soon to expect any such thing. Also strangely missing from the volume as a whole: the internet. What it’s done to us. What we’ve done with it. Even so, the assembled essays bear out the truth of the editors’ opening assertion: that “Irish writing in the 21st century appears significantly different from that of the 20th century” and “there are distinct areas where these differences can be pinpointed and explored”. A tiny bit of hedging: that “appears”. But we’ll let that slide. Ireland in the 21st century is different. So is its art. Once we were certain, of certain things, at least. Now we are uncertain about almost everything. Art is the great stable vessel in which we can hold that uncertainty for long uncertain moments. Here is a book to help us think about our art, and ourselves, now that we most urgently need to.

Title: BlackRock, NYSE push for staked ETH ETFs – Why it matters

BlackRock and NYSE Arca are advocating for staking-enabled ETH ETFs to enhance investor returns. Regulatory approval remains key. The demand for Ethereum[ETH] staking is rising, fueled by growing institutional interest and regulatory advancements. BlackRock has voiced its support for staked ETH ETFs, emphasizing their potential to enhance returns for investors. Simultaneously, NYSE Arca has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF. With Ethereum staking trends shifting, the landscape of ETH investment products is evolving rapidly. BlackRock’s Digital Assets Head, Robbie Mitchnick, recently stated that while the firm’s ETH ETF is a success, it remains “less perfect” without staking capabilities. He highlighted that staking provides additional yield and aligns with Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model. Mitchnick believes that unlocking staking in ETFs could be a game-changer, attracting a broader investor base. However, he also acknowledged the challenges of implementing staking within the ETF structure due to regulatory constraints and operational complexities. NYSE Arca has taken a step forward by filing a request with the SEC to incorporate staking into the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. If approved, this would significantly shift how ETH ETFs function, allowing them to generate staking rewards and potentially enhance investor returns. The SEC’s decision will be closely watched, as it could influence how other crypto-based ETFs are structured in the future. Recent data highlights significant shifts in ETH staking dynamics. According to data from Dune Analytics, Kraken and Blockdaemon have led the growth in staking deposits over the past month, while Coinbase has experienced the most substantial outflows. Source: DuneAnalytics This divergence reflects shifting preferences among institutional and retail investors regarding custodial staking solutions. Meanwhile, platforms like Lido, stakefish, and Upbit have maintained steady inflows, reinforcing their dominance in the staking ecosystem. The second chart provides deeper insights into Ethereum staking flows. Over the past few months, staking deposits have outpaced withdrawals, leading to a net positive flow. Source: DuneAnalytics The black line representing the two-week net flow showcases an upward trend, indicating growing confidence in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. Notably, principal withdrawals (shown in red) have decreased, suggesting that fewer investors are opting to unstake their ETH despite market fluctuations. This trend signals that long-term holders and institutions are embracing Ethereum staking as a sustainable investment strategy. The growing emphasis on staking carries significant implications for ETH ETFs and their investors. If approved, staking within ETFs could introduce an additional revenue stream through staking rewards, making ETH ETFs more appealing than traditional spot ETFs. Institutional investors may favor staked ETH ETFs, as they provide both price exposure and passive income through staking yields. However, regulatory uncertainty remains a major obstacle, with the SEC historically cautious about crypto-related products, particularly those involving staking. A favorable decision on NYSE Arca’s proposal could set a precedent, paving the way for more advanced Ethereum-based investment products.

Title: Pro-Beijing Paper Urges Li Ka-shing to Scrap Panama Port Sale

(Bloomberg) -- A pro-Beijing newspaper has called on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. to pull out from an agreement to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a group led by BlackRock Inc., marking an escalation of a pressure campaign on billionaire Li Ka-shing over the deal. The transaction will damage China’s national security and development interests, which directly violates Hong Kong’s laws on safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, the Ta Kung Pao paper said in a commentary Friday. The article didn’t identify CK Hutchison as the Hong Kong company in question but did name BlackRock as the buyer. CK Hutchison is expected to sign an agreement on the sale of its two Panama ports by April 2. It’s the key part of a wider deal to offload 43 facilities outside of Hong Kong and mainland China for more than $19 billion in cash proceeds. US President Donald Trump has hailed the sale as winning back control of the waterway from Chinese influence. “Stop the transaction and do not make the wrong calculation,” the paper said in the article. “Those who repeatedly emphasize that this deal is a ‘legal transaction’ under the freedom of contract are too naive and confused.” The paper has blasted CK Hutchison for “spineless groveling” to Trump and “selling out all Chinese people” in previous commentaries, which were reposted by China’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, signaling the criticism reflects the government’s view. Following the move, several prominent politicians, including the city’s leader John Lee, have also weighed in with veiled criticism. The latest article hasn’t been reposted by any Chinese agencies yet. The growing calls on Li to reconsider the port sale highlight the political risks for companies based in Greater China amid rising trade tensions between the world’s two most powerful economies. So far, Chinese officials haven’t explicitly given the 96-year-old Li and his firm any demands or instructions. But if Beijing does decide to take a tougher approach, it could raise concerns that sweeping national security laws imposed on Hong Kong since 2020 might ensnare businesses’ assets and operations. While CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, it has limited exposure to both the US and China. The conglomerate is registered in the Cayman Islands and accrues only 12% of its revenue from Hong Kong and the mainland, while Europe, Canada and Australia make up the bulk of the rest. CK Hutchison slumped as much as 4.4% in Hong Kong on Friday after the company reported weaker-than-expected profit and warned in its earnings statement of a deteriorating global business environment due to geopolitical and trade tensions. The Panama Canal is “of great significance to China’s national interests,” Ta Kung Pao said in its latest commentary. As the second largest user of the waterway, China’s foreign trade stability and logistics costs are directly affected by its operation, it said. The sale of the two Panama ports may lead to an increase in the logistics costs of Chinese companies and threaten the long-term development of China’s manufacturing industry and foreign trade, it said. The transaction is a “concrete manifestation” of US attempts to put pressure on China’s supply chain by controlling key ports, it added. “It is not an exaggeration to say that the transaction will cause endless troubles to China’s economy and national interests after it is completed,” the paper said. Several Chinese state agencies have started looking into the deal for any potential national security or antitrust violations, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. Oklahoma lawmakers advanced legislation that could “gut” a three-year-old anti-ESG law and leave state taxpayers vulnerable to environmental, social, and governance-based investing, Heritage Action for America contends. The Oklahoma Senate Energy Committee recently advanced SB 714, sponsored by state Sen. Dave Rader, which amends the existing law on state contracts and transfers enforcement authority from the state treasurer to the state attorney general. A House version is sponsored by Speaker Pro Temp Anthony Moore. Both lawmakers are Republicans. “It’s in a lawsuit now and we just want to make some corrections so it’s not in a lawsuit,” Rader told The Daily Signal in a phone interview. “We are being proactive to keep the bill applicable.” The 2022 Energy Discrimination Elimination Act bans state investments with companies that boycott or penalize energy companies for lawful action, according to Heritage Action. Oil and gas companies are key to the Oklahoma economy. In July, Oklahoma District Court Judge Sheila Stinson issued an order to permanently block the law, stemming from a legal challenge by a state pensioner. The case is pending an appeal in the state Supreme Court. Rader argued enforcement of the anti-ESG law should have been with the attorney general in the first place. Under the 2022 law, the Oklahoma state treasurer, currently Todd Russ, keeps a list of financial institutions that boycott oil and gas companies and creates a schedule for state governmental entities to divest from the companies that include BlackRock, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. BlackRock has been among the largest boosters of ESG pressure on companies. Oklahoma Senate bill 714 is touted as “fixing” the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act (EDEA); SB 714 is not a fix, but a full dismantling of Oklahoma values by prioritizing political ideology over the interests of Oklahoma taxpayers, shareholders, and residents.Heritage… The state Senate bill would transfer enforcement authority to the state attorney general, currently Gentner Drummond. Drummond is handling the appeal. It would also change disclosure and judicial provisions for state governmental entities. Heritage Action counters the bill would “gut the EDEA and return power back to woke finance and climate activists.” “The changes SB 714 makes to the EDEA would again allow taxpayer dollars to subsidize the demise of Oklahoma’s economic interests by empowering asset managers to use Oklahoma dollars to fund the Left’s agenda,” Heritage Action says in a statement. The bill also creates loopholes for government agencies to ignore the law to divest companies if there are “transaction costs.” Any divestment will have some “transaction cost,” but the bill doesn’t require the costs be weighed against the significant cost to the state for subsidizing ESG, according to a bill analysis from Heritage Action. Rader was not familiar with this during the call, but he said state agencies have been reluctant to enforce because of the litigation. “Some state agencies are hesitant to do anything with the law because they only want to maximize the investment, and they worry about the legal ambiguity,” Rader said. “That’s why we want the attorney general. It’s not really a treasury matter.” Russ, the state treasurer, opposes the legislation. It would allow “financial firms could continue discriminatory practices under weakened enforcement,” the treasurer’s spokesperson Lara Blubaugh said. “The result could delay accountability, the attorney general’s office lacks the expertise and immediate oversight needed to track and respond to financial discrimination effectively,” Blubaugh continued. “The office has a structured, consistent process for managing state funds, investments, and financial relationships; moving oversight to the attorney general’s office adds uncertainty along with a century’s long-tested constitutional process.” Past comment by Drumond suggests a faceoff between the two GOP officials. In a December statement, after making the appeal to the state’s high court, Drummond faulted the state treasurer’s office for losing in a lower court. “There is a great deal of lost ground to make up on this litigation after the treasurer and his hand-picked legal counsel failed in district court,” said Drummond. “I will not let that failure deter my efforts to protect Oklahoma’s oil and gas industry from discriminatory practices by financial entities kowtowing to a radical environmental agenda.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

The total is spread across 79 DeFi platforms, with the top three RWA protocols accounting for 36% of that total-value locked, according to DeFiLlama. The top three RWA protocols—Maker RWA, BlackRock BUIDL and Ethena USDtb—hold $1.298 billion, $1.232 billion and $1.182 billion in TVL, respectively. Analysts are forecasting an explosion in the real-world asset market as investors flock to tokenized RWA products. Global investment firm VanEck has predicted RWAs will surpass $50 billion in market capitalization by the end of 2025. Total-value locked is a commonly used metric for user demand in DeFi that measures the value of assets deposited on a particular decentralized platform. Real-world asset tokenization refers to the process of creating digital representations of tangible assets, including T-bills, real estate, and gold, on blockchains. Maker's RWA is backed by real estate and digitized traditional RWAs such as treasury bonds, while USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares. BUIDL is a tokenized money market fund built on the Ethereum network. Tokenizing RWAs has gained traction as investors turn to investment vehicles based on treasury bonds, stablecoins and various commodities to hedge against crypto market volatility and diversify their portfolios. Launched early last year, BlackRock’s BUIDL holds $373 million in assets, while other tokenized treasury-backed funds such as Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Ondo Finance's OUSG are also attracting investor dollars. Meanwhile, interest in stablecoin-backed tokenized funds is picking up, with Ethena USDtb's TVL increasing 1,000% over the past month, according to DeFiLlama.

The Energia All-Ireland League enters the homeward straight with the last three rounds of the regular season over the next three weekends, and nowhere is there more of a make-or-break feel to the day’s action than on the Aviva Stadium back pitch. Fifth-placed Lansdowne, Division 1A’s form team, host third place Terenure, who go into the game on 48 points, just above Cork Con on points difference and just two points ahead of their hosts. Lansdowne have won five of their last six games to close in on the top four and the playoffs, their only defeat being in that sequence being a 49-46 loss away to Clontarf when beaten with the last kick of the game. Interestingly, the former Cork Con back three player Rob Hedderman, who scored a try in last season’s final against Terenure, is named for a rare start on the wing. Terenure, themselves beaten with the game’s final kick by Clontarf last time out three weeks ago, have been hit by Leinster dipping into their squad for their trek to South Africa, with outhalf Caspar Gabriel, scrumhalf Fintan Gunne and fullback Henry McIrlean all on duty with their province. Conor McKeon, the former Connacht scrumhalf, starts at outhalf, with Aran Egan remaining at fullback and Alan Bennie at scrumhalf. Lansdowne, perhaps benefiting from not having any players in the Ireland Club side for their win in Portugal, are also seeking revenge for the 28-22 defeat in Lakelands in round three, and quite simply whoever wins this reprise of last season’s semi-final will find themselves in the top four, whereas whoever loses will be outside the playoff picture entering the final two rounds. Young Munster are technically the only team with seemingly nothing tangible to play for in the top flight, yet they have picked a notably strong looking side for the visit of Cork Con. Evan O’Connell, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, centre Shay McCarthy and fullback Patrick Campbell have all been released by Munster for this game, and the former Ireland Under-20 and current Munster academy winger Fionn Gibbons is named on the bench for what will be his first game of the season since rupturing his ACL last summer. The champions have seen an eight-game undefeated run come to a halt with successive defeats but retain a settled side featuring a strong midfield of Niall Kenneally and Seán French. After their fifth last-ditch win of the season, leaders Clontarf are now eyeing up a home semi-final and will be strongly fancied to take another stride toward that objective at home to a understrength UCD side who have also been hit by Leinster’s trek to South Africa. Already without key backrower Ronan Waters, St Mary’s have also lost Ethan Baxter after he was injured on Ireland Club duty, so ex-Munster centre Dan Goggin starts at number eight at home to a strong looking Ballynahinch. City of Armagh should take a step towards preserving their 1A status at home to Garryowen, for whom a 15th successive defeat will confirm their relegation. Energia Men’s All-Ireland League (2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v UCD, Castle Avenue; Lansdowne v Terenure College, Aviva back pitch; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Templeville Road; Young Munster v Cork Constitution, Tom Clifford Park.

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—If China wanted to disable the Panama Canal to stop the flow of military or cargo ships through it, it likely could do so through an attack on the software system, military veteran and “Hot Zone” podcaster Chuck Holton says. Using a Chinese ship to physically block the canal could cause a temporary disruption, but a cyberattack would likely create a much more serious issue, according to Holton, a former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-war correspondent. If China were to “scrambled the software that is used to open and close the locks, or something like that, now you’ve got a bigger problem,” Holton said, adding that it is “very likely” China already has the ability to “scramble” the technology used to operate the Panama Canal. The “software that runs the canal, very likely, is also infected with Chinese hackers,” he said, and if China “wanted to damage or shut down the canal, they could probably do it from Beijing with a few keystrokes. They don’t have to have Chinese troops at the port and they don’t. They don’t need them.” Holton, who serves as a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, lives in Panama and was part of the U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989 to oust the nation’s corrupt dictator, Manuel Noriega. Standing in the square of Casco Viejo, Panama City’s historic district, Holton told The Daily Signal that China is actively working to gain influence in Panama, but “China is not running the canal.” During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” But Panama President José Raúl Mulino denies China is operating the canal. Trump’s comments on the canal, coupled with a recent large canal port deal between an American-based company and a Hong Kong-based company, have called attention to China’s influence in the region. The Chinese government has been critical of a deal for a Hong Kong conglomerate, CK Hutchison, to sell ports in the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. Trump has praised the deal, but CK Hutchison says the agreed-upon deal is “purely commercial” and has nothing to do with Trump’s recent comments on the canal. About 10,000 people work at the canal, the majority of whom, according to Holton, are Panamanian. The U.S. built the Panama Canal and operated it for decades, but in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to begin the gradual transfer of the canal to Panama, with the complete transfer by the end of 1999. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and operates through a lock system, raising ships above sea level to connect to the Gatun Lake before lowering them back to sea level. On average, 36 to 38 ships pass through the canal each day, according to The Associated Press. About 70% of the ships passing through the canal are coming from or headed for the U.S., though the shipping companies themselves may not be American. U.S. military ships do use the canal, and in the event of a conflict with China, anything China “could do that would complicate the U.S. Navy’s ability to move troops and products … into or out of the war zone, obviously, that’s a strategic issue for the United States,” Holton said. For years, Holton explained, China has been growing its power in Panama through economic and political ties. Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-led investment and infrastructure project, in 2017, but announced in February that it would not renew its participation in the Chinese project. China’s presence in Panama is not new, though political and economic ties are more recent. The first groups of Chinese arrived in Panama in the 1850s to help build the trans-Panama railroad. China’s influence is noticeable in the Latin nation through the presence of Chinese cultural centers, architecture, and Chinese-owned businesses. Holton says Panamanians know the nation has “a problem with Chinese influence, and it’s more with our government, it’s more with our economic system,” but, he added, the same cannot be said of the canal. Right now, the relationship between the U.S. and Panama is “confusing,” he said, because “Panama is an ally of the United States. Panamanians love Americans. They’ll say all the time that America’s our big brother … and so they’re a little befuddled by the president’s comments that seem very antithetical to, or negative toward, Panama.” The U.S. has a “long history of being a blessing to Panama,” Holton said, adding, “I don’t see why we need to change that now. That should be, the question is: How can we come and have a win-win situation with Panama and the United States?

Title: Amid Trump Tariffs, Where Do China-Mexico Ties Stand?

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Mexico’s government is attempting to downplay its relationship with China to avoid Trump’s ire, but ties continue beneath the surface. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (left) meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of theG-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Nov. 18, 2024. In the beginning of March 2025, I traveled to Mexico to speak with a range of officials and experts about activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its companies in the country, among other topics. In the midst of U.S. attention to China’s activities in Mexico and across the region, and in the face of threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexican products, the Mexican government of Claudia Sheinbaum is reportedly attempting to restrain high-profile activities with China that it perceives could antagonize the Trump administration. Nonetheless, beyond a small number of completed or postponed projects with China – such as a BYD hybrid car plant and the Maya tourist train – that have received particular high-level U..S scrutiny, the China-Mexico relationship continues to grow and deepen. Political Relations President Sheinbaum’s caution toward China appears to be reciprocated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It’s been over three months since China’s outspoken former ambassador to Mexico, Zhang Run, departed for a post in the Foreign Ministry at the end of 2024, yet the Chinese government has not yet named a new ambassador. That’s particularly unusual in CCP engagement with a country as large and important as Mexico. Beyond the state-to-state relations, China’s engagement in Mexico also extends to the legislative branch and subnational governments. There is a China friendship committee and an Asia committee in the Mexican legislature headed by leftist Workers’ Party (PT) member Yeidckol Polevnsky. Senate President Geraldo Fernandez Noroña, also of the PT and considered more radical than Polevnsky, is a powerful advocate for strengthening Mexico’s relations with China and reportedly has a close relationship with China’s embassy. China also courts Mexico at the state and local level, both through regular business delegations to Mexican states, few of which bear fruit, as well as at least 15 Mexico-China “sister city” relationships. Military and Defense Ties In military affairs, the current and recent Mexican administrations have restricted engagement with China. This year, neither the Mexican Army War College (CODENAL) nor the Navy War College (CESNAV) are hosting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) cadets, although the army has done so previously. In 2024, CESNAV hosted a visit by a sizable contingent from the PLA Superior War College. Also, in September 2023, a delegation of 16 PLA members, as well as a military delegation from Russia, visited and marched in Mexico’s Independence Day parade. Although China has not sold Mexico substantial military equipment, it did participate in an ill-fated joint venture to assemble 6.5 ton First Auto Works (FAW) trucks in Mexico. A China-based company also reportedly sold the Mexican Army uniforms, with the Mexican partner company – which is tied to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) ally and former Interior Minister Adan Agosto Lopez – reportedly profiting from a 300 percent markup on the cost paid to the Chinese wholesalers. In addition, the Mexican Navy purchased three Chinese catamarans for $26.7 million for a tourist transit, which it operates from Mazatlán to the island of San Blas. Beyond arms sales and engagements, China has assigned a capable military attaché, Army Colonel Cui Yungmao, seeking to strengthen military engagement and pursue arms sales opportunities. Cui reportedly has excellent Spanish and is a regular visitor at Mexican Army and Navy military institutions. China-based military companies regularly have a substantial presence at the annual Mexican Air Force air show (FAMEX), which they reportedly use to court the Mexican military and the Mexican Space Agency (MSA). Beijing has long courted the MSA. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has reportedly signed agreements with the Technical University of Beijing to bring students to China for graduate-level training on satellites and space sciences. On the other hand, the MSA’s plan to launch a satellite in China was reportedly switched to another provider and another site, possibly to avoid alarming the Trump administration. Chinese Private Security Companies (PSCs), represented in organizations such as the Mexico-Chinese Private Security Council, have sought work in the Mexican market, but have not to date established a substantial presence. Drones from the Chinese firm DJI and Chinese-made military equipment, including body armor used in confrontations against the Mexican military and other adversaries, are reportedly readily available for purchase by criminal organizations in Mexico on the black market. Chinese Investment in Mexico In commerce, driven by nearshoring, Chinese investment in Mexico in recent years has expanded to approximately $2 billion per year. The well-respected commercial consultancy Rhodium Group identified $13 billion in Chinese investment in Mexico in approximately 700 transactions between 2013 and 2023. In the digital space, Huawei has become a leading infrastructure provider, diversifying from telephone equipment to other services. Indeed, by 2024, Huawei had invested an estimated $1.3 billion in Mexican cloud computing infrastructure alone. The company, principally through Telmex, is also reportedly providing such services and infrastructure to the Mexican government, including the presidency, the Secretariat for Communication and Transportation (SCT), and a number of ministries. There are also rumors of a Huawei offer to provide technology and data services to the country’s national intelligence centers. In addition to Huawei, a range of Chinese companies are active in Mexico’s telephone sector, including Oppo, whose Mexico market share has reportedly expanded rapidly in recent years, as well as the China-based companies Honor, Xiaomi, and ZTE. The Chinese company Hikvision, operating in Mexico since 2016, including a research center in Queretaro, continues to be a dominant player in commercial and private security systems, including a number of initiatives to provide cameras for public security for towns around Mexico. Chinese computer and electronics manufacturer Lenovo has made Mexico its largest production and research and development (R&D) hub in Latin America, expanding its sales to the Mexican market by 25 percent in 2023 alone. Reportedly, Lenovo tries to keep out of the public spotlight. This year’s $22.8 billion acquisition by Blackrock of 80 percent of the properties of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports will dramatically change the Chinese profile in the port sector. Hutchison had previously operated ports in Veracruz, Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo, Tijuana, and Ensenada. In the automotive sector, although plans for a factory by the electric car maker BYD remain on hold, Giant Motor Corporation, which represents First Auto Works (FAW) and the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp (JAC) production facility in Hidalgo, as well as Shanghai Automotive industrial Corporation (SAIC) and Beijing Automotive Industrial Corporation (BAIC), continue to have a substantial presence in the Mexican market. BAIC and Foton are major players in the market for buses. In construction, although the China Communication Construction Corporation (CCCC), in conjunction with the 30 percent CCCC-owned Mota Engil, have completed most of the track work for the Maya tourist train, there is a question of their continuing role. The Mexican Army continues to build train stations and other facilities to make the infrastructure functional. In a similar fashion, although China Railway has completed most of its improvements to Line 1 of the Mexico City Metro, it continues a presence on the line with a long-term maintenance contract. China-based companies have expressed interest in investing in warehousing, logistics, and other facilities in Mexico’s “Trans-Isthmus Corridor,” whose development is a priority for the Sheinbaum government. To date, no concrete projects have yet materialized. In the lithium sector, the Chinese company Ganfeng continues to own the Bacanora lithium field, but its ability to exploit it continues to be paralyzed, following former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s February 2023 initiative to nationalize Mexico’s lithium sector. Ganfeng is now in litigation over the issue. Stores specializing in Chinese merchandise have also expanded notably in Mexico’s retail sector, including not only informal shops in markets such as Tepito, but networks of brick-and-mortar stores such as China Market and Hogar China. These chains are expanding not only in Mexico City but around the country in cities such as Hidalgo, Puebla and Queretaro. Products from China exceeded 20 percent of all imports for the first time in 2024. There are concerns over whether such stores fully operate in conformity with Mexican tax and other laws. In July 2024, the Sheinbaum government symbolically raided and shut down China Mart, a three-story retail outlet for Chinese products in Plaza Izaga 89. China-Mexico commercial collaboration in general is reflected in its business councils. The China-Mexico Chamber (MexCham), under working President Victor Cadera, principally represents Mexican companies working in China, while the China Chamber of Commerce and Technology of Mexico, headed by Amipola Grijalva, is more focused on networking involving Chinese companies and their counterparts in Mexico. Academic and Media Engagement Mexican academic and intellectual engagement with China continues to expand. Mexico’s sixth Confucius Institute, providing Beijing-sanctioned instruction in Chinese language and culture, recently launched in the University of Guadalajara. The University of Veracruz in Jalapa opened a nongovernmental Center for China Studies, complementing others in Mexican public institutions, including in the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the College of Mexico (one of the country’s oldest), the Autonomous University of Baja California in Tijuana, University of Guadalajara, and the Asia-Pacific (APEC) Studies Center in the University of Colima. China’s government reportedly provides 10-20 scholarships per year for Mexicans to study in China, in addition to countless scholarships for Mexican students coming directly from Chinese universities. China-based companies also provide sponsored training programs for Mexicans to study in China, such as Huawei’s “Seeds for the Future” program. Just within the context of its employment of Mexicans, Huawei may have brought as many as 100 Mexicans to its training center in Shenzhen in the past five years. As in other parts of the region, China also actively courts Mexican media outlets. The left-oriented journal Jornada regularly carries content from Xinhua. The more centrist Reforma reprints content from Chinese media. China’s recently departed ambassador, Zheng Run, was a featured regular columnist in Milenio. Indeed, Milenio reporter Alma Paola Wong, among others, received a sponsored trip to China, and other representatives of Milenio and other respected media outlets were brought to China by Huawei for a media technology demonstration. Conclusion Mexico’s relationship with China will continue to be shaped by the “strategic triangle” involving the Mexico-U.S. and China-U.S. relationships. Despite the caution exercised by the Sheinbaum administration, the multidimensional China-Mexico relationship continues to evolve through its own momentum. China, in practical terms, is not an “alternative” to the United States for Mexico, but for both good and bad, it will continue to be an important part of the dynamics shaping Mexico’s future. R.

Title: Death announced of businessman Pat Dineen

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has led the tributes to the late businessman and sportsman Pat (PJ) Dineen who chaired Irish Steel, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis, as well as playing cricket for Ireland on over twenty occasions. Mr Dineen (87) of Blackrock in Cork, but originally from Glasheen in the city, died on Thursday surrounded by his family “after a long and happy life.” He is survived by his wife Colette, sons Peter and Roger, daughter Linda as well as his brother Dick, grandchildren, son and daughter-in-law, extended family and friends. Mr Martin took time out of his trip to Brussels to issue a statement in which he said that Pat Dineen had made an “enormous impact on Irish industry, sport and public life.” “A great wit, with a keen business mind, Pat guided Bord Gáis, Irish Steel and Bord na Móna through some successful and challenging times. Pat retained his lifelong love of cricket, having been part of the Irish team that famously defeated the West Indies in 1969. My sympathies go to his wife Colette, children and wider family and many friends in his native Cork.” Cork Chamber of Commerce President, Rob Horgan, said that Pat was a “ a long-time friend and supporter of the business community. ” “He founded a very successful insurance company, Dineen Life & Pensions, in the 1960s, consolidating and expanding in the 1970s before it was later sold on. Later in his career, he brought this expertise to Bord Gáis, where he oversaw the construction of the Kinsale Head gasfield and pipeline, and also served as an executive chairman of Irish Steel, overseeing its transition from a loss-making company to a profitmaking enterprise and, ultimately, its sale. Our deepest condolences to his entire family and our thoughts are with them at this time.” Well known Cork auctioneer Dominic Daly said his late friend had led a rich and varied life and was a success at everything to turned his hand to over the years. “He was working for I think Standard Life (when we met) and I was in the wine business. He was very business orientated and gentlemanly. He was very in to cricket. And soccer – not as many people knew that. He was also very good at squash.” Mr Dineen’s life in business started in 1965 when he established his life and pensions company in Cork. The business grew rapidly and in 1972 he sold 40 per cent of the company to the merchant bank Charterhouse. The international insurance group Sedgewick acquired the Charterhouse stake a year later and the company became Sedgwick Dineen. He sold his stake in the company, which was valued at over £10 million, in 1994. Before setting up his own company he had worked for Norwich Union and Standard Life. During his time at Irish Steel, which he joined as executive chairman in 1993, he guided the company through several difficult years and its sale to Ispat International. He later told The Irish Times that the sale to the Indian firm had come down to the wire with Irish Steel coming “within eight hours of closure.” Mr Dineen was chairman of Bord Gáis from 1984 to 1989. During that time he oversaw the acquisition of the town gas companies throughout the State and the construction of the Kinsale Head gasfield and pipeline. Away from business he was a member of the legendary Irish cricket team which famously beat the powerful West Indies in 1969 at Sion Mills in Co Tyrone. Cork Cricket Club said he was a “true icon of Munster and Irish cricket.” “Pat captained the club on six occasions between 1963 and 1984, leaving an indelible mark both on and off the field. His contributions to the game and his club will not be forgotten.” Dolphin Rugby and Football Club said that they were “deeply saddened by” the death of their former member and player. Tributes were also paid to Mr Dineen by Munster Cricket and Cricket Leinster. He will lie in repose at Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork on Friday from 5pm to 6pm. His requiem mass will take place on Saturday at 10am at St Joseph’s SMA Church in Blackrock in Cork City.

Title: Chinese anger at sale of Panama Canal ports to US investor highlights tensions between the two superpowers

Associate Professor in US History, University of Nottingham Maria Ryan has received funding from the British Academy. University of Nottingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners When Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison announced it was selling its two port concessions on the Panama Canal to a US consortium led by New York-based giant BlackRock, the Chinese government issued a strongly worded rebuke. Through government-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao, Beijing accused the US of forcing the deal “through despicable means”, and claimed that if this was completed: “The United States will definitely use it for political purposes … China’s shipping and trade there will inevitably be subject to the United States.” CK Hutchison’s decision to sell its ports, which it has operated since 1997, to a US-led buyer came after the US president, Donald Trump, criticised Chinese influence over this strategically vital waterway. In his inaugural address, Trump claimed, falsely, that “China is operating the Panama Canal” and vowed “we’re taking it back”. In fact, data shows that the majority of traffic through the canal goes to or from the US. This has stoked fears in Beijing that US companies operating ports on the canal will do Washington’s bidding and potentially seek to restrict China’s access. Beijing’s angry response indicates the rivalry between the two great powers is deep and ongoing. While it is likely that this rivalry will continue to intensify under Trump, the president is unpredictable. Indeed, he sees unpredictability as a virtue – a way to keep advisers and foreign leaders on their toes. When asked last year whether he would support Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, Trump gave his own twist on the longstanding US policy of “strategic ambiguity”, saying: “I don’t want to reveal my cards … I wouldn’t want to give away any negotiating abilities by giving information like that to any reporter.” This means there are multiple plausible outcomes for the US-China relationship in the second Trump administration. On the one hand, there is a very strong, bipartisan consensus in Washington that China poses a systemic, generational challenge to American power. Whereas Russia is viewed as a disruptor, China is a potential peer competitor that could build a new international order based on Beijing’s preferences and interests. Since Trump’s first term in office, the US has been aggressively waging a “tech war” on China to limit its technological and military development, by cutting off access to high-end semiconductors designed by US companies. This was intensified in the Biden years with new sanctions on Chinese tech companies, and the passage of the Chips and Science Act, designed to encourage the return of semiconductor manufacturing to the US. Defensive weapons sales to Taiwan had already been increased in Trump’s first term – and remained at high levels under Joe Biden. What Biden called “extreme competition” with China has become the main organising principle of US foreign policy. While Republican lawmakers have, so far, been willing to go along with Trump’s diplomacy when it comes to Russia, there is likely to be less tolerance of a similar approach to China. Unlike other US presidents, Trump does not seem to believe that alliances extend American power in the world – although he does still want the US to be the undisputed number one. In his second inaugural address, he vowed to “build the strongest military the world has ever seen”. Trump sees China as an economic adversary, one of the reasons for imposing punitive tariffs of 20% on all incoming goods. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own and and has proposed more restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals. These are vital components of semiconductors, electric batteries and many weapons – and the global market is dominated by China. The US State Department recently signalled a possible shift in policy towards Taiwan, removing the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence” from its fact sheet on Taiwan in February. This irritated Beijing, which sees the island as an integral part of China. This subtle move away from the US’s longstanding “One China” policy – along with the tariffs and Trump’s hostility to alleged Chinese influence over the Panama Canal – suggests the continuation of a hostile, competitive approach to China. That said, as Trump’s recent diplomacy with Russia and his comments about absorbing Greenland showed, he is not afraid to upend the established norms of US foreign policy. He enjoys provoking the “globalist” foreign policy establishment. He lauds his own deal-making abilities, and would not want to fight a war with China over Taiwan. Trump is attracted to “strongman” leaders and claims to have “a great relationship with President Xi”. He achieves his goals by taking maximalist positions (for example, the punitive tariffs) which he uses to extract concessions. At a recent press conference, Trump stated: “I see so many things saying we don’t want China in this country. That’s not right. We want them to invest in the United States. That’s good. That’s a lot of money coming in.” Trump is well aware the US is heavily dependent on imported semiconductors from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) – the world’s leading chip manufacturer – and has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US semiconductor industry. He recently took credit for TSMC’s announcement that it would invest a further US$100 billion (£77 billion) in three chip factories in Arizona, declaring that production of vital semiconductors inside the US was “a matter of national security”. But it will take years for TSMC’s investments to come to fruition in terms of aiding US self-sufficiency in chip manufacture. In the meantime, it is not out of the question that Trump could seek a deal with China that guarantees US access to imported chips from Taiwan, in return for China absorbing the island peacefully. Given the historic importance of Taiwan to Beijing, this could appeal. Avoiding war could also be popular with Trump voters who want to put “America first” without getting embroiled in foreign wars. Although the hawkish China consensus is firmly embedded in Washington, its continuation is not guaranteed while the mercurial Trump is at the helm.

Title: TRON ETF rumors heat up with Justin Sun’s latest move – Why?

Justin Sun hints at Tron ETF as USDD grows, TRX shows potential but faces challenges. Justin Sun is in the spotlight again, this time with hints of a possible ETF for TRON [TRX]. Along with the recent expansion of TRX to the Solana blockchain and the ongoing growth of its algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, TRX seems to be working towards greater institutional involvement and wider market integration. Amid market uncertainty and consolidation, TRX focuses on regulatory compliance, cross-chain integration, and stablecoin development. This strategy positions TRX to capitalize on the next phase of crypto adoption. In a recent social media post, TRON founder Justin Sun hinted at a TRON ETF, prompting speculation about whether TRX might soon join the ranks of regulated crypto financial products. The timing is notable: with Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs already approved, traditional finance is warming to crypto’s more established assets. Source: X BlackRock and Fidelity are actively advancing new applications, and TRON could soon follow suit. While no official filing has been confirmed, Sun’s hints at institutional interest suggest ongoing behind-the-scenes efforts. If a TRX ETF becomes a reality, it would represent a significant step in TRON’s transition from a niche project to mainstream financial markets. TRON’s USDD stablecoin is gaining momentum, recently surpassing a $270 million market cap. Amid heightened scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins, USDD’s resilience stands out, particularly in emerging markets where dollar-pegged assets are vital for daily transactions. Sun remains committed to expanding USDD across multiple blockchain networks, extending its reach beyond TRON’s ecosystem. As one of the most widely used innovations in crypto, stablecoins highlight TRX’s broader goal of achieving real-world utility rather than merely speculative interest. With rising global demand for stable, censorship-resistant assets, USDD’s growth could play a pivotal role in shaping TRX’s next chapter. At press time, TRX was trading at $0.233, showing signs of a modest recovery following a sharp drop earlier this month. The daily RSI stood at 54.45, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This indicates a potential for further upside, albeit cautious. OBV remained relatively flat around 97.31 billion, showing weak conviction from buyers despite the recent bounce. Source: TradingView TRX’s price action shows a minor higher low, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. However, without a significant volume increase or an RSI breakout above 60, any move beyond the $0.24 resistance level may struggle to hold. Traders should monitor for a confirmed breakout or an uptick in OBV to validate the possibility of sustained upward momentum.

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): Gemini adds Canvas document editing and Audio Overviews. Google has introduced two new features for Gemini: Canvas and Audio Overviews. Canvas allows users to draft, edit, and refine documents and code within Gemini, with integration to Google Docs for collaboration. The tool also supports code generation for apps and scripts with real-time previews. Audio Overviews, previously part of NotebookLM, are now available to summarize and present information via audio. Both tools are part of Gemini’s broader push into productivity and multimodal interfaces. Importance for marketers: These enhancements support AI-driven content creation and code development, offering marketers more efficient tools for ideation, copy generation, and automation workflows. Study shows AI-generated meme captions score higher on average. A study comparing meme captions written by humans, AI, and human-AI teams found that captions by GPT-4o scored higher on average for humor, creativity, and shareability. AI consistently produced broadly appealing memes, though the funniest individual captions were still human-made. Human-AI teams created more ideas efficiently but felt less ownership. The study highlights AI’s role in boosting productivity while also noting emotional and qualitative trade-offs in creative collaboration. Importance for marketers: AI can increase output and audience resonance in content creation, but marketers should balance efficiency with human insight to maximize creative impact and emotional connection. Stability AI unveils model to turn images into 3D videos. Stability AI released Stable Virtual Camera, a new model that converts up to 32 images into videos with simulated 3D depth and dynamic camera paths. The tool supports formats up to 1,000 frames and multiple aspect ratios. It’s currently available under a research-only, noncommercial license. Though early versions show limitations with complex textures and scenes, the model enables users to create immersive content without traditional 3D tools. Importance for marketers: This model presents new creative options for immersive advertising and storytelling, enabling brands to produce 3D-like video content from 2D assets at lower cost and complexity. Mistral AI releases small model that outperforms GPT-4o Mini. Mistral AI has launched Mistral Small 3.1, an open-source model with 24 billion parameters that matches or exceeds GPT-4o Mini’s performance. The model processes text and images, supports 128k token contexts, and runs efficiently on modest hardware. Mistral is promoting digital sovereignty by making the model accessible under an Apache 2.0 license. The company also highlighted tools like Mistral OCR and Saba. Importance for marketers: Open, efficient AI models like Mistral Small 3.1 offer cost-effective alternatives for marketing applications, enabling on-device AI integration without reliance on large cloud-based proprietary platforms. Baidu unveils two new AI models to rival US competitors. Baidu introduced two new AI models, including ERNIE X1, which it claims rivals DeepSeek R1 at half the cost. The model offers advanced reasoning and autonomous tool use. Baidu also launched ERNIE 4.5, with strong multimodal and high-EQ capabilities. These models aim to bolster Baidu’s position in the global AI race as Chinese firms compete with US tech giants. Importance for marketers: Competitive advances from global AI players mean more options and price competition for AI-driven tools, offering marketers new opportunities in content creation, personalization, and regional expansion. Adobe launches agentic AI platform and prebuilt marketing agents. Adobe introduced agentic AI to its Experience Platform, offering 10 prebuilt agents for tasks like audience optimization, personalization, and content production. The new platform integrates with GenStudio Foundation and Brand Concierge for seamless campaign management. Adobe also announced data-sharing partnerships with AWS, Microsoft, SAP, and others to improve AI model training across platforms. The launch was announced during Adobe Summit in Las Vegas. Importance for marketers: Adobe's AI tools automate key marketing functions at scale. The interoperability and prebuilt agents help marketers streamline personalization, campaign planning, and content generation across ecosystems. Anthropic reportedly working on voice capabilities for Claude. Anthropic plans to introduce voice interaction for its Claude AI assistant, according to company executive Mike Krieger. The feature is being prototyped for desktop use and could become a more natural interface for users. Anthropic has discussed potential partnerships with Amazon and ElevenLabs to support this capability. No launch date has been announced. Importance for marketers: Voice-enabled AI offers more intuitive user interaction. Marketers may explore voice-based engagement tools, conversational commerce, or hands-free content creation using Claude once this feature launches. AI-powered search engines found to cite incorrect sources 60% of the time. A Columbia Journalism Review study revealed that generative AI search tools provided incorrect citations in over 60% of tests. Eight platforms, including ChatGPT and Perplexity, were evaluated using 1,600 queries. AI tools often generated plausible but incorrect answers rather than declining to respond. Some also ignored publisher restrictions. Paid versions frequently delivered more errors than free ones. Researchers raised concerns about growing reliance on these tools for news and research. Importance for marketers: Marketers relying on AI-driven search tools should vet information carefully. Misinformation risks can damage brand credibility and misguide strategic decisions based on flawed AI output. Microsoft partners with Inait to develop brain-like AI models. Microsoft has partnered with Swiss startup Inait to create cognitive AI systems modeled on mammalian brain reasoning. The technology integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks, aiming for adaptive, energy-efficient systems. Potential applications include finance, robotics, and enterprise tools. The partnership builds on 20 years of digital neuroscience research and will use Azure for deployment. Importance for marketers: Brain-inspired AI could yield more nuanced customer insights, smarter automation, and faster learning systems—advancing personalization and predictive marketing capabilities. OpenAI and Elon Musk agree to expedited trial over for-profit status. OpenAI and Elon Musk have agreed to fast-track their legal dispute over OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model. The case will proceed to trial in autumn. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, alleges the organization deviated from its original nonprofit mission. OpenAI counters that the move is necessary to secure investment and stay competitive. The trial outcome may influence OpenAI’s ability to raise capital.

Meta requires disclosure of AI use in Canadian political ads. Meta will now require advertisers to disclose if political or social issue ads in Canada use AI to create or alter images, videos, or audio. This includes content depicting realistic but fake events or individuals. The rule aims to reduce misinformation ahead of Canada’s federal elections. Meta has also added tools to label AI-generated content and expanded restrictions on political ad use of generative AI.

Signed-out users are limited to Gemini 2.0 Flash. The Android app continues to require account login. This change aligns the Gemini web experience with Google Search, emphasizing accessibility. Importance for marketers: Easier access to Gemini without sign-in lowers barriers for user adoption and engagement, expanding opportunities for marketers to test or promote AI-powered experiences and tools.

Photo Credit: x/ @hhtbzayed As the US shapes crypto laws, the UAE advances in Web3 regulations This week, the US hosted UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss technological cooperation, energy, and investment opportunities. During his visit, he met with key officials from President Trump's administration, including White House crypto czar David Sacks, where cryptocurrency regulation was a key topic. While the US is still shaping its crypto laws, the UAE is among the first nations to have established regulations. Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and David Sacks have initiated discussions on expanding digital currencies, particularly within international financial systems. They also explored upcoming investment opportunities at the intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence (AI). “As technological advancements accelerate, fostering collaboration and adopting forward-looking strategies remain essential pillars for driving sustainable growth and achieving long-term impact,” a post by Sheikh Tahnoon Zayed Al Nahyan said on X. I explored with @davidsacks47 , the Special Advisor on AI and Crypto, the transformative effects of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the expanding role of digital currencies in reshaping financial systems, and the investment opportunities emerging at their… pic.twitter.com/BXz5ZTl5FV Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's royal family, leads MGX, a sovereign wealth fund focused on advanced tech investments. Earlier this month, MGX acquired a minority stake in Binance for $2 billion (roughly Rs. 17,403 crore). As per reports, MGX has committed $7 billion (roughly Rs. 60,209 crore) to President Trump's ambitious Stargate project, that aims to build high power AI data centres across the US. OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank are other participants in the $500 billion (roughly Rs. 43,00,668 crore) project. Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Larry Fink (BlackRock), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia) also met with MGX chief Sheikh Tahnoon Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss the US's AI initiatives. Al Nahyan later shared glimpses of the meeting on X. I discussed with Larry Fink, Satya Nadella, and Jensen Huang our shared commitment to harnessing AI's transformative potential to accelerate global growth and drive groundbreaking innovation.With new partners joining the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), we are expanding our… pic.twitter.com/YW34SzMMRF Earlier this week, President Trump hosted Zayed Al Nahyan at the White House alongside senior federal officials. The 47th US President later shared the update on Truth Social. “Discussions included ways for our countries to increase our partnership for the advancing of our economic and technological futures,” President Trump posted. At present, US SEC's Crypto Task Force is designing a regulatory framework to govern the crypto sector. During the recently held Crypto Summit at the White House, President Trump directed the Task Force to present its proposed laws by the end of August. The UAE has been implementing Web3 regulations for over two years. Key milestones include the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) framework, which regulates crypto trading platforms, and Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), that oversees virtual assets in the region. With its advanced regulatory framework, the UAE has become a key advisor for nations like the US seeking guidance on crypto policies. In January, Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim met with UAE officials to discuss the formulation of a supportive crypto policy framework.

Title: Another popular crypto X account hacked, spreads fake Ripple-SWIFT partnership news

Watcher Guru hack reveals security gaps on X as fake XRP news sparks turmoil in crypto community. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto-focused media outlet Watcher Guru confirmed that its official X account was hacked to promote a fake report claiming Ripple and SWIFT were close to a deal to use XRP in global payment systems. The unauthorized post went live on March 21 at 2:05 A.M. UTC. It falsely stated that Ripple would soon partner with SWIFT and that billions of XRP had been locked in escrow as liquidity reserves. The post quickly gained attention and sparked excitement in the XRP community, with many users believing it was true. For context, Bitrue, a prominent pro-XRP crypto exchange, mistakenly shared the fake news, amplifying the confusion. Shortly after, Watcher Guru clarified the situation, confirming that the post did not come from their team. According to the media outlet: “Our X account has been hacked and the previous post (now deleted) was posted by a hacker. We have 2FA enabled and have taken extreme measures to avoid hacks.” Due to automation, the same false report was also shared on Watcher Guru’s other social media accounts, including Telegram, Facebook, and Discord. The team said the reposting bot pushed the content to all channels before the issue was spotted. Meanwhile, Watcher Guru stated that the attacker had blocked Ripple’s official X account and that of its CEO Brad Garlinghouse to “presumably slow down a ‘false report’ response from their team.” This marks the second major breach of a prominent crypto platform on X. Earlier this week, DB News’ X account was hacked and used to spread a fake report about Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin and a false BlackRock ETF filing for Hyperliquid. Watcher Guru believes the breach may have started weeks earlier as its team had received a suspicious X link through Telegram on March 5. According to the team: “We noticed the link was formatted in a strange way. It was an official X Developer staging site using X’s official domain, however it included a specific path and ‘token’ query string which X links do not normally have.” Watcher Guru stated that its team flagged the link and contacted X’s Head of Cybersecurity, Christopher Stanley, but received no reply. Watcher Guru continued that while it cannot confirm the link that caused the hack, the firm noted that its breach resembled that of DB News, another crypto media outlet. According to Watcher Guru, its account, like DB News, had two-factor authentication enabled, no connected apps, and no API tokens were used to post the false information. It concluded: “At this time, we have not yet determined the exact source or method behind the hack. All unauthorized posts have been removed, and our account has been secured. We are contacting X for further clarification.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Real-World Assets Cross $10 Billion in Total Value Locked: DeFiLlama

Real-world assets (RWAs) are now a $10 billion category, according to data curated by DeFiLlama, with Maker, BlackRock's BUIDL and Ethena's USDtb each accounting for more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Of the three, USDtb — a stablecoin designed to contrast with Ethena's USDe — has had the fastest growth, adding over 1,000% in TVL in the last month. USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares whereas USDe uses crypto-assets and perpetual futures strategies for crypto-driven yields. CoinDesk previously reported that Treasury-backed tokens reached a record $4.2 billion market cap in the first quarter, driven by growth in Ondo Finance's OUSG and USDY tokens, BlackRock and Securitize's BUIDL, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Superstate's USTB. Treasury-backed tokens dominate, according to data aggregator RWA.xyz. The next highest category, tokenized commodities, comes in at $1.26 billion, with Paxos Gold leading with TVL of just over $500 million. Analysts say this reflects investor preference for safer assets amid bearish crypto sentiment, with T-bills outperforming what's offered for yield with major DeFi protocols like Compound.

Title: The climate movement is talking about carbon all wrong, a new book argues

Time Published: 2025-03-21T08:15:00Z
Full Content:
Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Burning oil, gas, and coal — literal fossil fuels, made from the compressed remains of ancient plants and plankton — has released carbon into Earth’s atmosphere, where it traps heat and alters the climate. That process has caused massive destruction and loss of life, and it will continue to do so. As a result, carbon came to be seen as something to “fight,” “combat,” and “capture.” Paul Hawken, the author of the new book Carbon: The Book of Life, argues that the climate movement is thinking about its work, and messaging, all wrong. “Those who call carbon a pollutant might want to lay down their word processor,” Hawken writes. Carbon, he notes, is after all the building block of life, the animating force behind trees, rhinos, eyelashes, hormones, bamboo, and so much more. Without it, Earth would just be a lonely, dead rock. So much for decarbonizing. Hawken has come to believe that treating carbon as something to tackle, liquefy, and pump into geological formations not only reflects the same mindset that caused climate change in the first place, but also further alienates people from the living world. There is no “climate crisis,” he argues, but a crisis of human thinking and behavior that’s degrading the soil, wiping out entire species, and changing the weather faster than people can adapt. “From a planetary view,” he writes in Carbon, “the warming atmosphere is a response, an adjustment, a teaching.” The book records a shift in his thinking. In 2017, Hawken published Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming, a book that ranked 100 climate solutions by how much they could reduce carbon emissions, from refrigerant leaks to food waste. The nonprofit Project Drawdown, which he launched, continues to implement these kinds of fixes around the world. But now, Hawken is forgoing straightforward metrics to focus on what he sees as a deeper cultural problem. “The living world is a complex interactive system and doesn’t lend itself to simple solutions,” he said.

Here's How The new book frames carbon as a flow — a cycle that moves through the atmosphere, oceans, soil, with the element absorbed by growing plants and exhaled in every animal breath. Hawken’s book is a lesson in what’s sometimes called “unlearning,” or letting go of old assumptions, like the idea that nature is something to fix or control. The book explores ways to repair a broken relationship with the natural world, drawing inspiration from Indigenous cultures and new scientific discoveries. Hawken marvels at how much remains unknown about carbon, which he dubs “the most mysterious element of all.” The book’s poetic language offers a stark contrast to the warlike terms climate advocates tend to use to describe carbon. Hawken argues that the typical metaphors are not only inaccurate — how exactly do you battle an element? — but also provide fuel for right-wing narratives that carbon has been unfairly demonized. Last week, E&E News reported that the Trump administration is planning a federal report making the case that a warming world would be a good thing, a pretext for weakening climate regulations. “Carbon dioxide is not an evil gas,” David Legates, a former Trump official, said in a recent video put out by the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank. “Rather, it’s a gas beneficial to life on Earth. It’ll increase temperatures slightly, and warmer temperatures are certainly better than colder temperatures.” Hawken wants a broad shift in how people talk about the natural world, though, not just a rethinking of the climate movement’s metaphors. He points to how financial institutions increasingly refer to nature as a commodity. In January, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, declared “natural capital” an investment priority. In February, Goldman Sachs launched a “biodiversity bond fund” turning ecosystems into investment products. The jargon used in scientific reports and global climate conferences also creates a sense of detachment that dulls the living things it refers to. Hawken describes the word “biodiversity” as “a bloodless term” and “carbon neutrality” as an absurd “biophysical impossibility.” Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one.

Here's How “We are numbed by the science, puzzled by jargon, paralyzed by predictions, confused about what actions to take, stressed as we scramble to care for our family, or simply impoverished, overworked, and tired,” Hawken writes. “Most of humanity doesn’t talk about climate change because we do not know what to say.” Even plainspoken terms like “nature” are suspect, in Hawken’s view: The concept only seems to exist to mark a separation between humans and the rest of the world. He points out that the Chicham language of the Achuar people in the Amazon doesn’t have a word for nature, nor do other Indigenous languages. “Such words would only be needed if the Achuar experienced nature as distinct from the self,” he writes. English, by contrast, he describes as a “rootless” language, borrowing terms from so many places that it struggles to teach the kind of deep, reciprocal relationships that are born from living in one place and caring for it over many generations. Hawken hopes to mend that separation by helping people discover the flow of carbon in their daily lives and kindle a sense of wonder about it. Carbon delves into mind-bending scientific discoveries about the kind of marvels that carbon makes possible. Bees, with their two-milligram brains, appear able to count, learn by observation, feel pain and pleasure, and even recognize their own knowledge. The rye plant senses the world around it with more than 14 million roots and root hairs, a network that one plant neurobiologist described as a type of brain. Hawken’s book is a reminder that carbon — despite all the problems caused by releasing too much of it into the atmosphere — is actually a gift. The goal of Carbon isn’t to map out a plan for saving the Earth, but to rekindle a sense of relationship with it. Where Hawken lives in California, his community recently restored a salmon stream, breaking down a concrete barrier under a bridge that had blocked the fish on their final journey up the stream to spawn. “The core of it is about care, and kindness, and connection, and compassion, and generosity,” Hawken said. “That’s where regeneration starts.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: BlackRock thinks Bitcoin could thrive in a recession – Will it?

Market sentiment on Bitcoin’s ability to hedge against economic pressure remains mixed. Bitcoin [BTC], at the time of writing, was trading at $85,387, up 2.30% in the last 24 hours. However, market sentiment remains divided. In fact, inflows have dropped by 54%, from 58.6K BTC/day to 26.9K BTC/day. Despite this, Blackrock’s Robbie Mitchnick believes Bitcoin could thrive, even in a recession. He pointed out that Bitcoin benefits from fiscal stimulus, lower interest rates, and monetary easing – All common during economic downturns. Additionally, fears of social unrest may push more people towards Bitcoin as a hedge. As Q2 unfolds, Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven will be put to the ultimate test. Will it prove its resilience? Through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), Blackrock has established itself as a major institutional player in the Bitcoin market, holding 570,582 BTC in its treasury. This includes a notable addition of 22,076 BTC this year alone. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Blackrock’s Head of Digital Assets, attributed Bitcoin’s decline below $80k on 10 March to “premature expectations” around the economic outlook. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) According to AMBCrypto, key factors include early rate cut speculation, Bitcoin’s evolving role as a strategic reserve, and insufficient awareness of the U.S debt crisis. Further compounding these pressures are Trump’s strict tariff plans. While the short-term market reaction led to the sharp “dip,” Blackrock’s $218.10 million in inflows – its monthly high – has reinforced Mitchnick’s thesis. The likelihood of a U.S recession has returned to the forefront after the FOMC meeting, with Chairman Jerome Powell adopting a “wait-and-see” stance. Essentially, the possibility of a recession cannot be entirely ruled out just yet. A key bullish signal during a recession is economic slowdown. Weak labor data dampens aggregate demand, prompting the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity via interest rate cuts. This liquidity influx often supports risk assets like Bitcoin in the medium term. However, while Blackrock maintains a bullish position, a recession typically unfolds through a brief cycle of declining demand, rising unemployment, and market corrections. This could put Bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative to the test. Bitcoin’s 22% decline from its all-time high of $109k could potentially signal the onset of a larger market correction, with more volatility ahead. This, unless Trump’s economic retest triggers a shift in market conditions. In February, inflation saw a month-on-month decline of 0.2%, dipping from 3% in January. Source: Trading Economics This easing inflationary pressure has led the Fed to halt rate hikes, though the possibility of further hikes remains on the horizon. Blackrock’s bullish thesis hinges on a more pronounced market flush-out – A sign that a deeper correction may be required before a bull market can truly materialize.

Title: The stablecoin trap: How financial surveillance is already here

The current U.S. financial system already operates as a digital control grid, with 92% of dollars existing only in databases, transactions monitored without warrants, and access to money revocable at any time. Government agencies like the IRS, NSA and Treasury collect and analyze financial data with minimal oversight. Stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), are not decentralized but controlled by major financial institutions. Proposed legislation like the STABLE Act and GENIUS Act enshrine financial surveillance, requiring strict KYC tracking on all transactions. A total ofÂ 134 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The European Central Bank plans to launch a digital euro by 2025, while Canadaâs leadership aligns with the World Economic Forum to advance a digital Canadian dollar. The ultimate goal is to tokenize all assets â stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities â under a global ledger, enabling governments to monitor and program transactions for compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer resistance to censorship and untraceable transactions. The fight for financial sovereignty is not about preventing future CBDCs but confronting the existing surveillance system and reclaiming privacy.

The fight for financial sovereignty is not about preventing future CBDCs but confronting the existing surveillance system and reclaiming privacy. The debate over Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has dominated headlines, with fears of a dystopian future where governments monitor and control every financial transaction. But what if the dystopia is already here? A closer look at the current financial system reveals that the surveillance state isnât coming â itâs already in place. The rise of stablecoins â cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar â has been hailed as a bridge between the volatile world of crypto and the stability of fiat currency. However, beneath the surface, these digital assets are becoming a backdoor to total financial control, enabling governments and corporations to monitor, restrict and even revoke access to money with the click of a button. The illusion of financial freedom The U.S. financial system is already a digital control grid. According to Patrick Wood, Editor at the Brownstone Institute, âThe battle isnât about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing.â Consider these facts: 92% of all U.S. dollars exist only as entries in databases. Your transactions are monitored by government agenciesâwithout warrants. Your access to money can be revoked at any time with a keystroke. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. The stablecoin Trojan Horse While President Trumpâs Executive Order 14178 ostensibly bans CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act donât protect financial privacyâthey enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict Know Your Customer (KYC) tracking on every transaction. âThis isnât defeating digital tyranny â itâs rebranding it,â warns Aaron Day, author of "The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control." Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions. Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer a way out, providing untraceable transactions and resistance to censorship. âPrivacy isnât a luxuryâitâs a tool for self-reliance,â says Day. âWithout privacy coins, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted.â As the walls close in on financial freedom, the time for complacency has passed.

The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer a way out, providing untraceable transactions and resistance to censorship. âPrivacy isnât a luxuryâitâs a tool for self-reliance,â says Day. âWithout privacy coins, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted.â As the walls close in on financial freedom, the time for complacency has passed. The surveillance state isnât comingâitâs here. The stakes are real, and the time to act is now. Sources include: Technocracy.news Forbes.com GlobalLegalInsights.com The U.S. financial system is already a digital control grid. According to Patrick Wood, Editor at the Brownstone Institute, âThe battle isnât about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing.â Consider these facts: 92% of all U.S. dollars exist only as entries in databases. Your transactions are monitored by government agenciesâwithout warrants. Your access to money can be revoked at any time with a keystroke. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. The stablecoin Trojan Horse While President Trumpâs Executive Order 14178 ostensibly bans CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act donât protect financial privacyâthey enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict Know Your Customer (KYC) tracking on every transaction. âThis isnât defeating digital tyranny â itâs rebranding it,â warns Aaron Day, author of "The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control." Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions.

Sources include: Technocracy.news Forbes.com GlobalLegalInsights.com Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions. Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place.

Business FILE PHOTO: The entrance of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, in Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG :Shares of CK Hutchison fell on Friday after the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate reported weak earnings and dividends and said its operating environment would be volatile. Underlying profit for the group, which is having to contend with displeasure from Beijing over the sale of its ports business, slid 11 per cent of HK$20.8 billion ($2.7 billion) last year, slightly short of expectations. Its final dividend was cut to HK$1.514 per share from HK$1.775 for 2023. Shares in the company lost 1.9 per cent in early Hong Kong trade. The company has agreed to sell its ports business to a BlackRock-led consortium, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal. The deal is expected to garner the firm more than $19 billion in cash but has been criticised by Beijing. CK Hutchison made no mention of the ports deal in its earnings statement, although it said "geopolitical and trade tensions have ... risen significantly." "The operating environment for the Group's businesses is expected to be both volatile and unpredictable," it said in the statement. It added that it will constrain capital spending and new investment and focus on stringent cash flow management.
