Title: Goldman Sach says it's just following the law as it strips out references to DEI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-diversity-dei-hiring-goals-annual-report-trump-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-27T15:30:06Z
Full Content:
Goldman Sachs tamped down the diversity language in its annual report as DEI efforts come under fire from the Trump administration. The bank also said "aspirational hiring goals" it set five years ago expire this year without saying whether it planned to set new goals. Goldman's 2024 annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, referenced diversity relating to human capital just three times, versus 14 in the 2023 report and 16 times in the 2022 report. The Wall Street bank also eliminated a section of the report previously titled "Diversity and Inclusion," its hiring breakdown by race and gender and its diverse hiring goals by race and gender. Earlier this year, Goldman dropped a policy requiring companies it advises on IPOs to have at least two women directors. Goldman isn't alone. The $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock this week also cut mentions of its "three pillar DEI strategy" in its annual report, as well as a breakout of its employee demographics by race and gender. It also amended the metrics used to determine borrowing costs for a $4.4 billion credit facility which was previously tied to its efficacy in boosting internal DEI targets. The changes come as President Trump cracks down on DEI. In January, he invoked directed the Department of Justice to investigate DEI policies, prohibiting private organizations from instituting such initiatives in employment practices related to federal contracts. In a statement, Goldman CEO David Solomon cited changes to the law. "We have made certain adjustments to reflect developments in the law in the US," he said. "Our people are a powerful example of that and that's why we will continue to focus on the importance of attracting and retaining diverse, exceptional talent." Goldman said in the report that it still believes in a diverse workforce and would "continue to develop programs consistent with our fundamental commitment to inclusive merit-based promotion and compliance with the law." The bank's 2023 report set goals to hire of 50% women analysts and associates, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the UK. In 2023, it also broke down its workforce by race and gender, saying its analyst and associate hires included 49% women professionals, 9% Black professionals and 13% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 15% Black professionals in the UK. Also gone are mentions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or HBCUs. In the 2023 report, Goldman said it would seek to double the number of campus hires in the US recruited from HBCUs in 2025 relative to 2020.What's more, a breakdown of the firm's aspirational goals for diverse hiring is also missing. For Goldman, DEI has historically been framed as a business imperative. In its 2022 annual report, the firm stated that "diversity at all levels" was "essential to our sustainability" and cited efforts to increase representation among women and underrepresented groups. At the time, the firm touted stats, such as one where it said approximately 57% of Goldman's board was diverse by race, gender, or sexual orientation. Even so, its track record on DEI has come under fire for other reasons. Last year, reporting from The Wall Street Journal found that numerous senior women at the bank felt it hadn't done enough to support their career prospects or advancement, and was still heavily male-dominated.

Hello there! Feeling nostalgic about those old Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo restaurants? Well, there's a new dynamic duo in the neighborhood: Applebee's and IHOP. We got to try out their first hybrid restaurant in the US, which is hoping to appeal to young diners. In today's big story, the economy is showing signs of slowing down and some are saying DOGE isn't helping things. What's on deck Markets: An inside look at what life is like at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office. Tech: Nvidia posted another big earnings beat. Business: Jeff Bezos has a new rule for The Washington Post. But first, we're taking it slow. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The economic growth spurt some were hoping for with the new administration is coming up short. President Donald Trump's second term promised tax cuts, deregulation, and an environment that would get an economy firing on all cylinders. But investors and economic experts are raising concerns about a slowdown this year. Neil Dutta, the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, outlined how the US economy is starting to look sluggish. The market is also indicating something's amiss, as the 10-year US Treasury yield has dipped recently. That's a key benchmark of DOGE's success — lower yield means lower lending costs for consumers — but it's not dropping for the reasons DOGE wants, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. The group's cost-cutting efforts are actually further muddying the economic outlook, according to some, leading yields to drop as investors look for a safe haven. Dutta highlighted two things that have kept the economy humming — consumer and government spending — showing signs of strain. To Dutta's point, a trio of economic data released last Friday on consumer sentiment and housing indicated all was not well, which led stocks to have their worst day of the year. He's not alone in his concerns. Last week, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen listed several factors — tariffs, less immigration, and cuts to government spending — for why he was "actually pretty negative for the first time in a while" on the economy's growth potential and where the markets are headed. The Point72 founder said he expects a "significant correction." Truist chief market strategist Keith Lerner is also treading carefully. Just six weeks after talking about a buy-the-dip opportunity, Lerner downgraded US equities for the first time in years from attractive to neutral. Predictions of an economic dropoff predated DOGE and the administration. Before the election, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the US economy's growth would ease up in 2025. And as we're less than two months into Trump's second term, a lot is subject to change. But in the short term, DOGE's intent to clean up government waste could be speeding up the economy's slowdown. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer highlighted DOGE (in addition to tariffs and immigration) as "potential growth headwinds." All this might sound counterintuitive. Wouldn't reducing the government's massive deficit be good for the economy? Billionaire Ray Dalio said rising debt could lead to a financial "heart attack" if not addressed. But Cohen said the cost cutting is like a shock to the system. ​​"When that money's been coursing through the economy over many years and now potentially it will be reduced or stopped in many ways, it has to be negative for the economy," he said. 1. Bitcoin turns bearish. The crypto token has taken a tumble — down as much as 13% from its January high — and has officially entered bear territory. Tuesday was a real drag, with bitcoin ETF investors pulling over $1.1 billion. Between policy promises falling short and last week's $1.5 billion hack of crypto-exchange Bybit, confidence in bitcoins and altcoins has faltered. The volatility takes its toll, with crypto addiction becoming a growing concern. 2. Goldman takes the Lone Star state. Southern hospitality, an open-door culture, box seats at Mavericks games — these are just some of the highlights of working at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office, according to five employees who spoke to BI. And more perks are on the horizon with Goldman planning a new Dallas campus with rooftop gardens, childcare, and more. 3. Elliott Management founder Paul Singer doesn't have fun at work. The man behind the $72 billion fund knows how to have a good time: He likes skiing, snowmobiling, and playing the keyboard. At the office, though, Singer is all work and no play, preparing for risks at every turn. In a recent interview, Singer spoke about the stresses of running a firm and his concerns about the market, but he's in it for the long haul. 1. Nvidia shrugs off DeepSeek concerns with a strong earnings beat. The chip giant reported revenue of $39.33 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates by more than $1 billion. On the earnings call, Nvidia's CFO said that demand for Blackwell chips also exceeded expectations — and the stock rose in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang said that AI models like DeepSeek's R1 need 100 times more compute, on the call. 2. Is having Palantir on your résumé the golden ticket for tech hires? CEO Alex Karp seems to think so. BI spoke with six technical recruiting specialists to find out if this was the case. Some weren't so sure, saying the industry prefers strong results over credentials. Palantir may also still struggle with brand recognition, and its culture could be a turn-off for those hiring. 3. Amazon's AI-powered Alexa+ is finally here. After slow progress, the tech giant unveiled its long-awaited voice assistant on Wednesday. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said the upgraded Alexa can invent bedtime stories, offer recipes, and book reservations through partner companies. Here's what to expect — and how much it'll cost. 1. Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband are at war with an exclusive private island club. In a lawsuit, the model and her real-estate broker husband are alleging Fisher Island Club's board of directors threatened them and wrongfully expelled them from the club, harming their reputation and causing them millions of dollars in damages. The private island that's just south of Miami Beach is home to multiple billionaires and high-profile celebrities. The Fisher Island Club denies the lawsuit's allegations as baseless and believes the complaint "is nothing more than disgruntled former members." 2. Jeff Bezos has an opinion on the opinion page. The Washington Post owner announced sweeping changes to the paper's opinion section in a note to staff and shared on X. The paper's op-eds must support "free markets" and "personal liberties," he said. As part of the overhaul, the opinions editor, David Shipley, has stepped down. While newspaper ownership often sets the tone for op-eds, the note is Bezos' latest controversial move after over a year of internal turmoil. 3. There will be winners and losers as the new Trump administration rewrites how business is regulated. Crypto firms including Coinbase and Robinhood have already benefited. Meanwhile, some legal experts predict an uptick in traditional securities cases and a continuation of the Biden DOJ's aggressive antitrust enforcement in cases against Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Ticketmaster.

Title: Bitcoin Pepe turns into a compelling alternative amid a bleak Bitcoin sentiment

Bitcoin’s recent tumble has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to its lowest level in over two years, signaling extreme fear among investors. Macroeconomic uncertainties, fueled by threats of trade tariffs from US President Donald Trump, have only added to the unease. However, amid this bleak backdrop, a new project dubbed Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a potential alternative for crypto enthusiasts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently hit a score of 10, its lowest since June 2022. That period saw major crypto collapses like Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, sparking widespread panic. Today, the sentiment echoes that fear, even without similar crashes. Bitcoin’s price has dropped nearly 16% in the past 30 days, hovering around $86,304. Analysts pin this on macroeconomic pressures, including Trump’s reaffirmed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with threats aimed at the European Union stoking fears of a trade war. Bitcoin investment products, particularly US spot Bitcoin ETFs, are bleeding cash. Over seven days, $3 billion flowed out, including a record $420 million single-day exit from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Funds like Ark 21Shares and Grayscale saw heavy withdrawals too. However, some analysts remain hopeful. Ben Simpson of Collective Shift says buying during extreme fear often pays off historically. But Arthur Hayes warns of a drop to $70,000. Ki Young Ju notes 30% corrections are normal in bull cycles, citing a 53% dip in 2021 that Bitcoin overcame. Amid the volatile crypto market, Bitcoin Pepe is stepping up as a fresh option in the stormy market with its ongoing presale. With the “World’s Only Bitcoin Meme ICO,” the project aims to bring Solana-like perks of speed and low fees to Bitcoin’s sturdy network. It’s a Layer-2 solution built for meme coins. The PEP-20 standard is its backbone. It lets anyone launch meme coins on Bitcoin, tapping into the blockchain’s unmatched resilience. Bitcoin’s staying power makes this a big deal. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale is rolling along in Stage 5 of 30, having raised $3,632,454 at press time, with the BPEP token priced at $0.0255 and set to rise to $0.0268 in the next stage. This tiered pricing shows a deliberate rollout plan aimed to incentivize early investors. As Bitcoin Pepe rides the meme coin wave, blending it with Bitcoin’s strength with instant transactions and tiny fees to draw users tired of Bitcoin’s usual costs, its presale offers a compelling haven for those who want to hedge against the current market turmoil. Looking ahead, the project’s roadmap hints at future growth with talk of partnerships and integrations.

Title: BlackRock moves $441 million in Bitcoin to Coinbase in the past hour

Share this article BlackRock moved 5,100 Bitcoin worth approximately $441 million and 30,000 Ether valued at about $71 million to Coinbase Prime within the last hour, as tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The transfer follows BlackRock’s Tuesday movement of $160 million in Bitcoin and $44 million in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, amid mounting pressure on BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT has experienced negative performance for three consecutive days, with approximately $741 million in net outflows so far this week, based on Farside Investors data. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day outflows of over $1 billion on Tuesday, with IBIT accounting for $164 million of the withdrawals. Given the recent Bitcoin ETF sell-off, with IBIT posting negative performance for three consecutive days, the deposit raises concerns about further liquidations. The latest transfers come as Bitcoin recovered slightly above $86,000 after dropping to $83,000 on Tuesday, its lowest level since November 2024. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes previously warned that hedge funds employing an arbitrage strategy—long IBIT and short CME futures for enhanced yield—pose a potential risk to Bitcoin’s price. He cautioned that if the basis spread narrows during a Bitcoin decline, these funds might sell IBIT and buy back futures, potentially driving the price towards $70,000.

Title: Fidelity Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios (Meant for Advisors)

My Money Blog One of my older relatives used Fidelity to manage their investments, and it was a hodgepodge of over 10 different mutual funds with a total expense ratio nearing 1%. The last time I measured its long-term performance, it lagged the benchmark indexes by… roughly 1%. Since then, I’ve always viewed that as a big part of Fidelity’s business model. They will sell you a portfolio that looks complex and smart, with fancy-sounding names and lots of moving parts. In the end, your performance will be okay because it will capture most of the stock market return, and most folks won’t even notice the chunk that was missing from fees. From a certain perspective, you paid a fee and got what you wanted: a stamp of approval from a respectable name. If you’re wondering how Fidelity can offer their excellent customer service and products at such a competitive prices, this is why. There are many people paying additional fees for their various advisory services. I’m okay with that – as a DIY investor I am comfortable turning down their upsell pitches for additional assistance. So when I saw the ETF.com article Fidelity Debuts All-ETF Model Portfolios for Advisors, I admit that I had my preconceived notions. Would they surprise me? You can view all of model portfolios here. Here is a screenshot with just their moderate risk 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. The hodgepodge of fancy names is still going strong. It’s like a checklist of industry buzz words: Dynamic Growth, Enhanced, High Dividend, Momentum, Inflation, Multifactor. I find it amusing that Dividend tends to equate to “Value”, which is the opposite of “Growth”. If you own this many different things, how different is it really from just owning the entire stock market? There still appears to be added complexity just for the sake of looking complex. Is it really helpful to have 2% in the iShares Core Dividend ETF? Or 2% in Cash Sweep? SIX to EIGHT different US bond ETFs??? With a weighted expense ratio of 0.25%, the overall cost is much lower than their active mutual fund portfolios from 10+ years ago. Competition from Vanguard and Blackrock have forced the expense ratios lower across the industry. So while the Fidelity model seems to pretty much the same, it does now come potentially at a lower price. So that’s a good thing. Some of these Fidelity ETFs are barely a year old, so we can’t do a backtest. I will have to remember to run another comparison 10 years from now between this 60/40 Fidelity ETF portfolio and a simple 3-ETF low-cost index portfolio from Vanguard (42% VTI/18% VXUS/40% BND) or iShares (42% ITOT/18% IXUS/40% IUSB). The low-cost index portfolio have a weighted expense ratio of about 0.04%. Can the Fidelity outperform and justify their higher fees? Complexity breeds dependency. If the advisor placed the funds in 3 or 4 ETFs, or a single Target Retirement Fund, the customer would soon question why they are paying for advisory services. We can’t have that! 🎯 😁 I imagine there’s also at least some overlap between some of these ETFs. Is there a tool that can take a number of ETFs/mutual funds and go through their holdings to determine how much you’re holding of each company? That could also be used to immediately determine how this fares against the Vanguard and iShares since the underlying holdings have been around for long enough.

Title: Bitcoin Post-Election Rally Crushed: Prices Dip Below $84,000 As Tariff Tensions Rise

On Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) prices plummeted to a four-month low, reaching as low as $81,000, as the anticipated “Trump bump” in the markets faded. This has prompted investors and traders to hedge against further decreases, with Bitcoin options indicating a notable interest in put options with a strike price of $70,000. According to data from Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, this strike price represents the second-highest open interest among all contracts set to expire on February 28, with a total of $4.9 billion in open interest poised to expire by Friday. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, Bitcoin has experienced a substantial decline of roughly 20% from its record highs. Market analysts attribute this downturn to a combination of factors, including Trump’s “aggressive geopolitical” stance and ongoing concerns about elevated inflation. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted, “Tariff policies are further dampening the outlook, and stubbornly high short-term inflation expectations add to the overall caution.” Newhouse also highlighted that the Bybit Ethereum (ETH) hack has not only exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price but has also negatively impacted overall market sentiment. The market has also witnessed a significant liquidation of bullish bets, with around $2 billion wiped out over the past three days, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin perpetual futures—a popular method for offshore investors to leverage their positions—saw a sharp decline in long positions during this timeframe. Adding to the bearish sentiment, demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has waned, with the group experiencing approximately $2.1 billion in outflows over the past six days. This reflects a broader trend of investors pulling back, with more than $1 billion withdrawn from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday alone, marking the largest outflow since these funds debuted in January of the previous year. The Fidelity Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were among the hardest hit. Bohan Jiang, head of over-the-counter options trading at Abra, commented, “This is a mix of spot selling and basis unwind. In my view, nearly all of this is from ETF spot outflows from directional traders.” Ethereum has also felt the impact of the Bybit incident, amplifying its volatility, while Solana (SOL) has surrendered gains achieved in recent months amid declining interest in memecoins. The market’s search for a new catalyst to reverse its bearish sentiment has led many investors to remain on the sidelines, rotating out of cryptocurrencies in a risk-off environment. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at crypto prime broker FalconX, stated, “The crypto market is still in search of a new catalyst to reverse bearish sentiment.” Currently, BTC is attempting to find support at $84,578, but has fallen another 4.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Title: Irelandâs electricity crisis: AI data centers to consume one third of national grid by 2026

While the Irish government, through the Irish Development Authority (IDA), champions these developments as critical to the nationâs digital economy, critics argue that the benefits disproportionately serve transnational corporations rather than Irish citizens. This raises urgent questions about energy equity, national infrastructure, and the long-term sustainability of Irelandâs energy policies. The rise of data centers and the AI boom The rapid expansion of data centers in Ireland is inextricably linked to the global rise of AI technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Irish data centers will consume a staggering 33% of the countryâs electricity grid by 2026. Currently, Ireland hosts between 82 and 95 data centers, with dozens more under construction or in the planning stages. By 2026, this number is expected to reach 130, cementing Irelandâs status as a European hub for data storage and processing. While the Irish government and the IDA frame this growth as essential for economic development, the reality is more complex. A report by international law firm Mason, Hayes & Curran highlights that âAI has significantly driven the demand for data center capacity,â noting that the scale and power requirements of these facilities have grown exponentially as AI technologies expand globally. Yet, public discourse often glosses over the role of AI, instead emphasizing the role of data centers in supporting everyday digital activities like streaming or online shopping. âWhether you realize it or not, every streaming show you watch, every match you make on Tinder, and every flight you book is facilitated by a data center,â wrote RTE Brainstorm in April 2024. While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Irelandâs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Irelandâs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm Ãowyn, exposed the fragility of Irelandâs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centersâmassive consumers of electricityâremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish governmentâs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nationâs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Irelandâs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords. As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Irelandâs futureâits people or its data centers?

The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm Ãowyn, exposed the fragility of Irelandâs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centersâmassive consumers of electricityâremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish governmentâs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nationâs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Irelandâs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords. As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Irelandâs futureâits people or its data centers? Sources include: Expose-News.com DataCenterMap.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai While the Irish government and the IDA frame this growth as essential for economic development, the reality is more complex. A report by international law firm Mason, Hayes & Curran highlights that âAI has significantly driven the demand for data center capacity,â noting that the scale and power requirements of these facilities have grown exponentially as AI technologies expand globally. Yet, public discourse often glosses over the role of AI, instead emphasizing the role of data centers in supporting everyday digital activities like streaming or online shopping. âWhether you realize it or not, every streaming show you watch, every match you make on Tinder, and every flight you book is facilitated by a data center,â wrote RTE Brainstorm in April 2024. While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Irelandâs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Irelandâs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role.

Sources include: Expose-News.com DataCenterMap.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future.

Title: Breitbart Business Digest: DEI Was Built on Fear; Now It’s Collapsing Under Reality

Bye, Bye American DEI The reckonings have been swift and dizzying. A dramatic and decisive shift is sweeping through corporate America, as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives crumble in the face of legal scrutiny, economic reality, and shifting public sentiment. What was once considered the inevitable march of corporate progressivism is now being reversed with stunning speed. Citigroup has eliminated race-based hiring quotas. Bank of America has followed suit. Goldman Sachs has abandoned its diversity mandate for IPOs. BlackRock, once a champion of DEI, has quietly stripped references to its diversity programs from corporate filings. Deloitte U.S. has told employees working on government contracts to remove gender pronouns from email signatures. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are rolling back DEI commitments as federal contractors. Even Amazon and Google, longtime standard-bearers of corporate progressivism, have purged DEI language from their reports and workforce policies. PBS has shuttered its DEI office entirely. What happened? Reality asserted itself. DEI programs, long protected by corporate inertia and the threat of activist pressure, have now run up against two immovable forces: the law and the bottom line. The Supreme Court’s ruling against affirmative action in college admissions made it clear that race-based decision-making in hiring was legally questionable at best. President Donald Trump’s executive order banning race and gender discrimination in federal contracting turned that into a direct threat to corporate balance sheets. Suddenly, compliance departments and general counsels had to take a hard look at policies that had long been implemented with little concern for legal exposure. Meanwhile, DEI’s economic toll was becoming harder to ignore. Despite years of corporate executives insisting that diversity initiatives boosted the bottom line, those claims never quite added up. Shareholders were left wondering why companies were prioritizing ideological agendas over maximizing returns. Employees grew resentful as hiring and promotions were increasingly dictated by identity rather than merit. Consumers, once silent, became vocal opponents of activist-driven corporate policies. The backlash was inevitable. This isn’t just a political correction. It’s a preference cascade—a moment when people and institutions rapidly abandon an ideology they once publicly supported but never truly believed in. History is full of such moments, where dominant narratives, long maintained through social pressure and enforced consensus, suddenly disintegrate. The medieval kings of Europe, for centuries, paid lip service to pagan gods while privately considering the growing influence of Christianity. Then, as soon as a key ruler—such as Clovis I of the Franks—converted, others quickly followed, exposing how fragile the old order had really been. Corporate America’s embrace of DEI functioned the same way: upheld not by deep conviction but by the fear of reputational ruin. Once a few key institutions abandoned it, the illusion of universal commitment crumbled overnight. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe followed a similar trajectory. The regimes of Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia seemed invincible—right up until the moment they weren’t. When Poland broke free in 1989, the chain reaction toppled East Germany, then the Soviet Union itself. The institutions of corporate DEI operated on the same model—an ideology enforced through intimidation and groupthink, rather than genuine consensus. The moment legal and economic incentives changed, corporations fled from it just as quickly as Eastern European states abandoned Marxism. Perhaps the most striking parallel, however, is with the rapid collapse of the eugenics movement. In the early 20th century, eugenics was considered the height of scientific progress, endorsed by leading intellectuals, politicians, and business leaders. Then came the horrors of World War II, and suddenly eugenics became a discredited ideology. Its former champions rewrote history, distancing themselves from the cause they had once fervently supported. The same pattern is emerging now with DEI. Companies that once prided themselves on their diversity pledges are quietly deleting the language from their websites, erasing references in annual reports, and pretending they were never all that invested in the first place. LGBTQ flag and Black Lives Matter banner on gym doors, Manhattan, New York. (Joan Slatkin/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) The media, predictably, is still catching up. The same outlets that once insisted the corporate DEI revolution was irreversible now publish cautious stories about companies “re-evaluating” their commitments. But the scale of this shift goes far beyond a temporary recalibration. This is not a pause. It is a full-scale retreat, a regime collapse. And it’s not just DEI that is falling. On Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and founder of Amazon, announced that the paper’s opinion pages will now be dedicated to defending “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos declared that opposing viewpoints can be “published elsewhere.” The left’s hold on our cultural institutions is being broken just as its hold on corporate America and Washington, D.C. has fallen. Of course, no entrenched ideology surrenders overnight. DEI has spent years embedding itself into corporate HR departments, government agencies, and university bureaucracies. The activists, consultants, and executives who built their careers around it will fight to preserve it. They will litigate, regulate, and pressure corporations to reverse course. They will frame this retreat as a “temporary setback” rather than a lasting correction. But the problem for DEI’s defenders is that preference cascades, once set in motion, do not reverse themselves easily. The same companies that once feared activist outrage now fear consumer backlash and shareholder scrutiny. The political winds have changed, the legal landscape has shifted, and the economic incentives are no longer in DEI’s favor. And this retreat from DEI and related left-wing policies is not just a political reaction. It is a structural correction. The same forces that fueled the rise of these policies—activist pressure, legal blind spots, and corporate groupthink—have now collapsed under the weight of scrutiny. Which means this shift is unlikely to be reversed. Unlike the left-wing ideological wave of 2020—which was fueled by emotion, activism, and media hype—this movement is driven by lawsuits, economic reality, and consumer behavior. DEI was an imposed orthodoxy, sustained by the fear of bad PR and the inertia of corporate groupthink. Once that spell is broken, there’s no putting it back together.

Title: SCB offers more overseas wealth options

Time Published: 2025-02-26T21:54:00Z
Full Content:
Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) is increasing access to international wealth products for Thai investors, aiming to expand assets under management (AUM) in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026. Under its wealth management division, SCB Wealth, the bank collaborates with subsidiaries of parent SCB X and global partners to drive business growth. According to chief executive Kris Chantanotoke, the bank offers a diverse range of global asset classes to facilitate Thai investors entering international markets. SCB's plan to expand its AUM in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026 aligns with projections that Thai wealth will grow to roughly US$1 trillion in the interim. The bank declined to disclose its current AUM and the total wealth of its Thai investors. According to Mr Kris, SCB X's subsidiaries and the bank's global partners supporting this business segment comprise SCB Asset Management, Innovest X, SCB Economic Intelligence Center, SCB Julius Baer, and its latest partner BlackRock. SCB Wealth serves three market segments: SCB Private, SCB First and SCB Prime. SCB Wealth offers a comprehensive suite of investment products and services, including deposits, lending, investments, estate planning, protection and tax planning. In addition to its existing wealth clients, the bank extends its services to "mass affluent" clients interested in portfolio investments, granting them access to global asset classes. Investment access is tailored to client needs, with options available through relationship managers or digital platforms. SCB wants to double AUM under its customer-centric investment theme by 2026 from 70 billion baht at present. The bank also plans to double the proportion of active wealth management clients investing through its digital platform, increasing their share to 30% of the total customer portfolio. "We aim to position SCB Wealth as the industry leader in terms of assets under advisory," said Mr Kris. SCB Wealth also introduced a unique investment model called "No Gain, No Pay" for select investment themes. Under this approach, if clients fail to achieve their targeted returns, the bank will waive the investment fees.

The price of Bitcoin dropped more than 6% in 24 hours to break below $84,000 on Wednesday. Notably, Bitcoin price has touched its lowest levels since November 2024, when it rose amid election momentum. According to crypto and stocks trader IncomeSharks, the market is bearish. BTC sold-off as the crypto market reacted to trade war sentiment, with this coming on the heels of the latest tariffs announcement by President Donald Trump. Having announced that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China will go into effect in April, Trump said he would slap 25% tariffs on the European Union. The news saw the S&P 500 fall, with over $500 billion in market cap wiped off. As equities reacted to the potential trade war, Bitcoin crashed below $84,000. Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BTC hit lows of $82,131. BTC price also dumped amid massive selling pressure from ETFs. Major issuers Fidelity, Ark and Grayscale all sold. BlackRock, which sent millions of dollars worth of BTC and ETH to an exchange on Tuesday, also offloaded $150 million of the flagship coin.

Title: Republicans labeled BlackRock as 'woke.' Here's a brief history of how the firm has tried to shed that description.

Many big American companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's pushback on DEI, but none of their steps carry more symbolic weight than a retreat by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. An early advocate of diversity, equity, and inclusion, BlackRock has removed all mention of the strategy from its latest annual report. The asset manager and its CEO, Larry Fink, have over the years become targets for Republicans who claim the firm is too "woke." What was the DEI section in the asset manager's last report has now been reframed as "connectivity and inclusivity" in the Tuesday filing. Last year, it said that it believed "a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success." This year it avoided mentioning the acronym or a diverse workforce, just "diverse perspectives." When reached for comment, a BlackRock spokesman referred to the new paragraph in its annual report that said the firm's approach to "building a connected and inclusive culture is aligned with the firm's business priorities and long-term objectives. Delivering for the firm's clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. "BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink." BlackRock has also removed references to a three-pillar strategy, which included phrasing around cultivating a work environment where employees felt "seen, heard, valued, and respected." The firm left out a section that previously broke down its US employees by gender and ethnicity. In its 2023 annual review, it introduced the statistics with a line saying that "BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy." Companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's executive order on "radical and wasteful" DEI programs, though a few big names such as JPMorgan Chase and Costco have reaffirmed their commitment to diversity initiatives. Through his annual investor letters, Fink promoted stakeholder capitalism and environmental, social, and governance investing, becoming the unofficial corporate poster child for the movements. In the last few years, however, Fink has had to tone down his support for ESG and defend against the idea that the firm has an ideological agenda it's forcing on the many companies it invests in through its mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also has critics on the political left. Climate activists have previously protested outside Fink's home and BlackRock's New York headquarters, calling for a divestment from fossil fuels. "The only agenda we have is delivering for our clients," he said in 2023 LinkedIn post, which he drafted as a response to being called the "king of the woke industrial complex" in a Republican Party presidential candidate debate. October 2017: Former Obama aide (and future Biden administration member) Brian Deese is named head of sustainable investments. November 2017: As part of a panel at the New York Times DealBook conference, Fink was asked about how diversity and inclusion are becoming investment criteria. He responded by saying that hiring behaviors will have to change, and they're talking to companies about it. (The clip, where he said, "You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors," went viral among conservative circles in 2023.) November 2018: The world's largest asset manager asks Russell 1000 companies with less than two female board members to improve their gender diversity. January 2020: Fink's annual letter, coming out just months before the COVID-19 pandemic reached New York, stated the company's focus is now on "putting sustainability at the center of how we invest." Fink wrote that "ultimately, purpose is the engine of long-term profitability." June 2020: Gavin Lewis, a managing director at BlackRock in the UK, starts the #IAM campaign after George Floyd's murder in Minnesota, and Lewis, a Black man, becomes one of the most well-known advocates for people of color in finance. January 2021: Fink lays out the firm's DEI strategy in his annual letter, which includes more inclusive hiring practices as well as a focus on "racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities. April 2021: After a Minneapolis jury convicted police officer Derek Chauvin of murder in the death of George Floyd, Fink wrote on LinkedIn that he hoped the country could begin to heal. "At BlackRock, we are committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion through every aspect of our business. While we have made progress, we still have a great deal of work to do," he wrote. "This is a somber day and one for deep reflection. As I look to the future, I am committed to ensuring that BlackRock does its part to contribute to a more just and inclusive society." January 2022: Larry says that stakeholder capitalism is "not woke" in response to conservative politicians' criticism that the company is pushing its politics on companies through its heft. June 2023: Fink officially stopped using the acronym ESG because it was being politically "weaponized." Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, he said he was ashamed to be part of the conversation and that ESG has been "misused by the far left and the far right." December 2023: In a debate for the GOP nomination for president, Vivek Ramaswamy called Fink "king of the woke industrial complex, the ESG movement, and the CEO of BlackRock, the most powerful company in the world." Fink responded in a LinkedIn post saying "We make decisions based on our clients' best interests, not political or ideological agendas." December 2024: Following Trump's election, BlackRock tones down the language on its board diversity policy. The updated policy removes a numerical target for gender diversity — which had previously been 30% of members being diverse, with at least two female directors and one director from an underrepresented group. A footnote suggests that BlackRock thinks 30% is still the expectation, but the updated policy also removed the need for companies to explain why their board is not more diverse. January 2025: The firm told clients it had withdrawn from the United Nations coalition Net Zero Asset Managers weeks before Trump's second inauguration. The firm's vice chair, Philipp Hildebrand, told clients that the coalition and other climate-related entanglements had "subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials" — a reference to lawsuits state attorneys general from oil-producing areas of the US such as Texas had filed against BlackRock over its stance on sustainable investing. These states though appear to be interested in more than just BlackRock's energy policies; Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to the asset manager, as well as other big-name financial firms, to understand their DEI policies.

Title: Starmer slashes aid to fund major increase in defence spending

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/26/2025 11:27:04 AM PST by RandFan Keir Starmer has announced that Britain will “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending paid for by slashing the foreign aid budget. The move, just two days before the prime minister is due to meet Donald Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was pandering to the US president, and fury from aid groups that say it could cost lives in countries that rely on UK support. In a surprise announcement, Starmer announced the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, with the budget rising to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – three years earlier than planned – and an ambition to reach 3%. Cabinet ministers are among those who voiced concern over plans to cut aid spending by 40%, after Trump’s own drastic cuts to the US aid budget. Several warned in a cabinet meeting of the risk of unintended consequences. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this month that the US plan could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence.

Title: Owners of McSorley’s in Ranelagh finalising deal to take over Wild Goose restaurant
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/02/26/owners-of-mcsorleys-in-ranelagh-finalising-deal-to-take-over-wild-goose-restaurant/

The new owners of well-known McSorley’s pub in Ranelagh are finalising a deal to take over the Wild Goose restaurant space above the pub, with a view to making it a seven-days-a-week food and drinks business. In an interview with Inside Business, a podcast by The Irish Times, publican Noel Anderson, the managing director of Grand Slam Bars, said: “Our plan would be to grow it more as a seven day a week business. We’ve just done a deal with the guy who runs a restaurant upstairs. We’re taking that back, the deal is just being finalised. “We plan on putting our own food into it, growing the food trade there, growing the cocktail trade and having a super events space upstairs. We’re excited about that.” He said the fit-out would cost hundreds of thousands of euro. “But I think it will be worth it. We own the building, it’s a long-term investment and we’re excited about what the future holds in Ranelagh.” The restaurant is currently occupied by the Wild Goose Grill, which is run by proprietor Kevin McMahon and is slated to close at the end of March. McSorley’s was purchased for €5.5 million in the middle of last year by Grand Slam Bars, which is owned by Mr Anderson and former Irish rugby internationals, Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney, Jamie Heaslip and Sean O’Brien. They also own The Bridge 1859 in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock pub, and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon venues in the city centre. The group employs more than 200 staff with combined revenues of about €11 million, Mr Andseron said. Food makes up about €4m million a year of its turnover. “Food is a big part of what we do now and that’s probably a lot of where the future lies,” he said. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager. Mr Anderson said McSorleys would continue be a “late focused” bar but having the space upstairs. “What’s exciting for us is that on big rugby days you will get business all day and all night as well,” he said.

Title: BlackRock, Bank of America drop DEI policies amid White House’s war on ‘woke’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/business/blackrock-bank-of-america-drop-dei-policies-amid-white-houses-war-on-woke/
Time Published: 2025-02-26T18:01:21Z
Full Content:
BlackRock and Bank of America dropped their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies — becoming the latest Wall Street giants to scrap the controversial initiative after the White House declared war on woke in corporate America. Regulatory filings reviewed by The Post show that Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.4 trillion under management, and the Brian Moynihan-led lender have axed language that promoted the representation and participation of different minority groups. The moves follow a crackdown led by President Donald Trump on DEI in the workplace, tasking Attorney General Pam Bondi in a Jan. 21 executive order that asked her to stamp out the practice. Bondi then vowed in a Feb. 5 memo that her DOJ would “investigate, eliminate, and penalize” such policies in the private sector. BlackRock, in its latest annual report filed late Tuesday, said that the company’s business “requires attracting the best people from across the world.” “BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink,” the report added. That represents a huge climbdown for the Democrat-donating CEO, who joined the chorus of Wall Street executives backing DEI in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the Black Lives Matter movement. In a letter to shareholders in 2021, Fink claimed: “To truly drive change, we must embed DEI into everything we do.” The Post has reached out to Blackrock for comment. BofA also backed off the much-criticized DEI policies in its annual report filed on Tuesday evening, formally ending the requirements for hiring and interviewing bankers. “We are deliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone hasthe opportunity to achieve their career goals,” the Charlotte-based firm wrote. A rep for Bank of America confirmed that was no longer company policy. “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions, and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration,” a bank spokesperson said. “Our goal has been and continues to be to make opportunities available for all of our clients, shareholders, teammates, and the communities we serve.” The rollback of DEI by the two giants of American finance echoes what some of their rivals have been doing since Trump trounced Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 in the race for the White House. Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have also scaled back their DEI commitments, while Goldman Sachs recently canceled a requirement to only take companies public if they had two diverse board members. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon seemingly remains an outlier, insisting on Monday that nation’s largest bank would stand by its diversity policies, despite lashing out at DEI initiatives in a leaked recording of a town hall meeting with Chase employees. Dimon told the audience that he “was never a firm believer in bias training” and blasted how the company was “spending money on some of this stupid shit.” The Wall Street giant also scrubbed much of its DEI language in its recent annual report to investors, further confirming the shift in mood at America’s major banks. “Everyone in my industry wants diversity in their teams and a workplace that reflects society at large, but everybody on Wall Street privately agrees that the DEI doctrine had started to actually go too far. People have been afraid to speak up,” said Dan McCarthy, a veteran Wall Street headhunter and CEO of the specialist global search firm, One Search. “My clients are still hiring diversity and they are telling us that they want to continue to hire diversity,” McCarthy, the head of the Young Women Into Finance non-profit, added. “But some DEI policies became toxic to the point where they became discriminatory. It feels like we are starting to see more common sense around it.” Advertisement

Title: Wall Street’s DEI Retreat: Where Major Banks and Asset Managers Stand

As Wall Street navigates the shifting landscape of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), some firms quietly retreat while others make just enough adjustments to sidestep political backlash. Bank of America (BAC), BlackRock (BLK) and Citigroup (C) have publicly scaled back DEI commitments, while Capital One (COF) appears to be walking a fine line, paring down efforts without making headlines. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), on the other hand, remains committed to broad DEI goals but is cutting back on certain spending. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Much like Big Tech companies, the financial sector embraced DEI in 2020 amid national protests over racial justice, pledging to address systemic disparities through hiring initiatives and investment strategies. However, with shifting political climates, banks are reassessing those commitments. The pressure is mounting as the Trump administration signals its intent to dismantle DEI initiatives across industries, from finance to education. Here’s how recent filings and statements from major U.S. banks and asset managers reveal a broader industry shift away from DEI: In its annual report filed yesterday (Feb. 25), the world’s largest asset manager deleted references to its “three pillar DEI strategy,” which included diversity commitments in talent and culture, client and business partnerships, and social impact and policy. Instead, the report included a statement, under a new section called “connectivity and inclusivity,” saying the firm is “committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink.” Bank of America, which also filed its annual report yesterday, removed all references to “diversity and inclusion” mentioned in its 2023 report. In a few places, the bank replaced the word “diversity” with “opportunity.” For example, the “diversity and inclusion group” under the bank’s human resources department has been renamed “opportunity and inclusion group.” “We have diversity and inclusion at our company. But, step back: We’ve always been the bank of opportunity,” CEO Brian Moynihan said at an event in Washington D.C. yesterday when asked about the bank’s DEI policy. In its latest annual report, U.S. Bank’s parent company, U.S. Bancorp, quietly removed the previous year’s overview of its DEI efforts, including the mention of its business resource groups, which supported minority employees. It also removed a pledge that the bank would include at least one woman or person of color on interview slates for all roles. The bank also scrubbed its staff diversity data. The previous year, the document specified that 57 percent of its U.S. employees were women and 39 percent were people of color. The latest filing had no such mention. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that U.S. Bancorp is about to have its first woman of color CEO. The bank’s president, Gunjan Kedia, who is Indian American, is set to take over as CEO in April. In a “Colleague Engagement Update” published Feb. 20, Citigroup announced it “will no longer have aspirational representation goals except as required by local law.” The bank also said it will no longer require diverse slates of candidates and interviewers. The move is a direct result of recent changes in U.S. federal government policy, Citigroup said. Morgan Stanley (MS)’s latest annual report didn’t include the “Diversity and Inclusion” section that was featured in previous years’ filings. However, the report retains a link to the company’s “Diversity & Inclusion” landing page, which is still live. The bank’s only DEI-related statements are nested under a section dubbed “Human Capital,” which contains the stated value of committing to “diversity and inclusion” but now also mentions “meritocracy”—a call to President Trump’s advocacy for “merit-based opportunities” across industries. Similarly, Capital One’s latest annual report also no longer features the previous year’s “Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” (DIB) section. While a brief mention of “pay equity” remains, the bank’s promise to pay women and employees of color “100 percent” what men and White employees are paid is notably absent. Capital One’s website still features a “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging” statement and a “Supplier Diversity Program,” whose goal is “to include qualified diverse businesses in every sourcing opportunity based on commodity need wherever these suppliers exist.” JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., firmly sticks to its DEI commitments despite political pressure. In its latest annual report, the bank said it “has been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).” However, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that some DEI programs are wasteful and said the bank would scale back spending on them while maintaining its broader DEI commitments. Similarly, Goldman Sachs (GS) states on its website that it remains “committed to making progress toward racial equity, advancing gender equality, and increasing representation at every level of our firm.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Thanks to Sarah Lamont and Jaylen Darling for their contributions Everyone talks about the $84.4T great wealth transfer in the context of liquid assets expected to be passed down over the next 20 years. However, fewer people are addressing the $15.5T in private business wealth that is much more operationally complex and obviously harder to inherit. SBA Office of Advocacy, Cerulli Associates, Federal Reserve, F-Prime Analysis Despite retirement-aged owners (boomers and older) owning 63.1 percent ($9.78T) of the private business wealth — $4.25T of which we estimate is distributed amongst small business owners with less than 500 employees — the inherent problems of transferring this portion of wealth creates ample market opportunity for startups in this space to address. For instance, only about 52 percent of heirs claim to actually want the family business which is exacerbated by the fact that the smaller the business, the less likely owners are to engage in exit planning. Stats like these suggest that many retiring SMB owners will need to consider alternative exit strategies outside of passing down their business to their children. More and more retiring owners will likely be selling their business to external buyers, which comes with a vast amount of challenges and pain points for both sellers and buyers. The challenges and pain points that SMB sellers and buyers face are vast: F-Prime Analysis Numerous players are adding value along the process of business ownership transfer from document preparation to deal execution. Acquisition marketplaces like Beacon, Get Acquired, and Tresle are aggregating demand and providing value through free valuation estimation calculators, access to advisors that facilitate deal transactions, and an anonymous listings platform that allows sellers to “match” with and approve prospective buyer inquiries. Companies like Boom are supporting companies in the early selling phase, helping owners with key management issues and valuation services to get businesses ready for the marketplace. Baton which just raised $10M in Series A funding and Tresle’s Plus product offers custom marketing assets for sellers; Beacon vets their buyers even going so far as to conduct background checks in specific cases; and Baton and Acquire.com provide a virtual “data room” to standardize document review and initial due diligence. Buyer-focused acquisition marketplaces are also providing unique value-adds. Companies like Private Market Labs leverage AI to gather a database of on-market small business deals for buyers. OffDeal leverages AI to match and connect buyers with the best off-market acquisition targets. Village Wellth boasts a financing solutions product, Aquirewell, that links buyers with advisors to review financials and structure deals as well as assess their lending readiness and find the best lending options by connecting them with multiple lenders. Boopos offers acquisition financing loans for recurring revenue businesses. Alternatively, business owners who don’t want to sell their business to external buyers can consider employee ownership transfer as an alternative exit strategy. Employee ownership as an exit strategy refers to an owner selling their majority stake in the business to the employees either directly or indirectly. There are multiple types of employee ownership structures with the most common model in the US being Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), with over 6,000 companies and favorable tax incentives. While each employee ownership type has its own tax and governance incentives, across the board employee ownership has shown to be a viable and compelling exit strategy that results in a preserved legacy and company culture and potential for ongoing involvement or gradual transition for the selling owner going through an already emotional process of selling their business. Common Trust is one startup that is taking advantage of the market opportunity by helping owners design and execute an employee ownership buyout using a customized purpose trust — an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) — that is cheaper than its more regulated ESOP counterpart. Startups in the space have the opportunity to get in front of selling owners who value company legacy preservation, tax benefits, and the flexibility of selling internally vs to external buyers. F-Prime Analysis On the other hand, the not-so-pretty side of business ownership transfer is that not all of them succeed. Companies like SimpleClosure and Sunset are addressing the clean up process for a sliver of the 80 percent of businesses that don’t survive by efficiently managing the dissolution process for owners. Traditional expectations of business owners to pass down their companies beyond generations are insufficient to deal with the impending demand of millions of business owners seeking retirement over the next decade. While the private business wealth transfer is well over trillions of dollars, numerous startups are adding value for selling owners and prospective buyers that are cheaper and more efficient than a traditional broker and go beyond a standard classified ad posting. The business wealth transfer space has never been more exciting, yet it needs serious investment in new infrastructure to scale and improve the investor experience. For entrepreneurs who’ve also spotted this opportunity, now is an opportune time to build category-defining companies. At F-Prime, we have been partnering with the builders of fintech infrastructure for more than 50 years, including early investments in Alibaba, Flywire, Toast, Quove/Plaid, Vestwell, and FutureAdvisor/BlackRock. We could not be more excited by the opportunity we see in business ownership transfer, and the chance to partner with the founders who will define this category. Here, we’ve outlined one view of how this industry is shaping up.

Title: Starmer: “Selling Britain by the Pound”

In 1973, the rock band Genesis titled their album ‘Selling England by the Pound’. They did so for various reasons. The phrase was taken from a Labour Party slogan of the time, reflecting the album’s critique of Britain’s changing identity and economic challenges in the early 1970s. The title symbolised the loss of traditional English culture due to ‘Americanisation’, such as increasing commercialism, consumerism and materialism. It also referred to the UK’s economic struggles, including inflation, industrial disputes and debates about joining the European Economic Community. And the title used a pun on ‘pound’ as both currency and weight, emphasising the commercialisation of British identity. Much has changed in the 52 years since that album was released. There is not much left of Britain to sell after decades of neoliberal globalisation. It has been a long journey since Thatcher’s privatisation-deindustrialisation-deregulation agenda of the 1980s. Successive governments have continued to push through that agenda, and Kier Starmer, current prime minister and handmaiden to elite interests, is no different. Image: Keir Starmer at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, 19 January. Congress Centre – Congress Hall. (Copyright: World Economic Forum / Benedikt von Loebell / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) In 2023, prior to coming to power, Kier Starmer attended the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual get-together in Davos. While there, with BlackRock in attendance, he declared that Britain was open for business. In a 2023 BBC interview, Starmer stated that he preferred Davos to parliament, explaining his preference by saying that Westminster is “too constrained” and “closed,” describing it as a “tribal shouting place”. Starmer said that at Davos he can “engage with people that you can see working with in the future”. Starmer prefers to engage with unaccountable, unelected global elites — the Davos crowd — rather than domestic parliamentary processes. At Davos, he stated that energy independence required an “active state”. But this does not mean nationalisation or public ownership. It involves using public money and leveraging the machinery of state to facilitate the needs of private capital. Starmer has a habit of saying all the things global capital wants to hear. In late 2024, Starmer posted on X: “I’m determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets. This can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like BlackRock, to capitalize on the UK’s position as a world-leading hub for investment.” Starmer met with Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, and expressed enthusiasm about partnering with the company. Furthermore, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated in a letter that Labour looks forward to working with BlackRock to “change the face of our UK”. And how will the face of “our” UK be changed? Image: Official portrait of Claudia Webbe MP (Licensed under CC BY 3.0) In December 2024, writing in the UK’s Morning Star newspaper, Claudia Webbe, former Member of Parliament, noted that BlackRock’s $10 trillion portfolio is more than the GDP of every country in the world except for the US and China. In her piece, she quotes Labour Member of Parliament Clive Lewis’s response to Starmer’s meeting with BlackRock. Lewis stated that instead of explaining how — 40 years of atomising, neoliberal plunder, the selling-off of and destruction of public services, the undermining of democracy, the hollowing out and selling off of natural resources at the hands of companies like BlackRock and other price-gouging corporations, billionaires and financial institutions — has led us to this point, the Labour Party has become the defender of elite interests. Webbe notes that BlackRock regards the future of the UK in terms of further cuts to welfare, more austerity and the further driving-down of wages, pensions and social security benefits. She adds that Starmer’s gushing about the government’s “partnership” with BlackRock may have been the trigger for wider public awareness and anger, but it was only the tip that gives away the iceberg of mass privatisation and intensified austerity that the Labour government is planning. BlackRock is a publicly owned investment manager that primarily provides its services to institutional, intermediary and rich individual investors. The firm exists to put its assets to work to make money for its clients. And it must ensure the financial system functions to secure this goal. And this is exactly what it does (see Black Rock’s War on Humanity here). Take food and agriculture, for instance. Many farmers and rural communities are worried about the potential threat of large asset management firms buying up agricultural land, especially following the British government’s proposed changes to inheritance tax on farms, set to take effect in April 2026. The new policy will impose a 20% inheritance tax on farms valued at more than £1 million, where they were previously exempt. The concern is that family farms in particular will be forced to sell up and get out of farming. This would certainly suit financial investors that regard farmland as a lucrative asset class. In the last couple of decades, farmland has become a tradable commodity (see The Commodification of Farmland here). Agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. The financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, stated: “Lacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).” The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital’s response to stagnation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. Bellamy says we have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource that supports food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity (once farmland is bought up, think of its role in the so-called BlackRock-driven ‘green transition’ — solar panels and wind farms throughout the countryside). An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated land prices. Aside from profiting from war, death and destruction, BlackRock is also heavily invested in the success of the prevailing globalised system of food and agriculture and profits from an inherently predatory food regime that is responsible for a cascade of environmental, social and health catastrophes, including poor-quality food and widespread illness. . Environmental activists, including global interfaith organization GreenFaith and Extinction Rebellion, protest BlackRock’s shareholder meeting on May 31, 2022. (Licensed under CC BY 2.0) . But why should Larry Fink care about this? Poor health is good for business. Scroll through BlackRock’s website and it soon becomes clear that it sees the healthcare sector as a strong long-term bet. Morality or conscience doesn’t come into it. Ordinary people are regarded as collateral damage or as digits on a computer screen to be rinsed for profit or plundered for gain. Hard-nosed billionaire and businessman Larry Fink, with the help of facilitator-in-chief Starmer, sees a golden opportunity to further hollow out Britain for the benefit of global finance. The criticism that Keir Starmer lacks vision is too kind. His vision, if we can call it that, seems to be selling Britain by the pound — a metaphorical fire sale of remaining national assets and potential while struggling to articulate a compelling narrative for the future to ordinary people. Starmer’s leadership is more about managing decline than charting a new course, despite his talk of making Britain a global leader in AI, an area in which the US and China are already well ahead. After years of Conservative austerity and Brexit turmoil, Britain now has another unpopular prime minister who seems content to peddle its future piece by piece. When Starmer stated that he is determined to “deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets”, do you think he was actually referring to ordinary people? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Home Internet

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: NASDAQ files for Grayscale’s Polkadot ETF – Is DOT’s public trading debut near?

Grayscale’s single-asset focus diverges from BlackRock and Fidelity’s diversified index-based crypto approaches. Grayscale has officially submitted a Form 19b-4 filing with NASDAQ to launch the Grayscale Polkadot Trust. It is expanding its crypto investment offerings for institutional investors to gain exposure to the Polkadot [DOT] ecosystem. This application follows Grayscale’s expansion into altcoin ETFs, with similar filings for Solana [SOL], Litecoin [LTC], XRP, Dogecoin [DOGE], and Cardano [ADA]. The filing is now subject to review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has 45 days to decide whether to approve, deny, or extend its evaluation. If approved, the ETF would offer institutional and retail investors a regulated means of gaining exposure to Polkadot without directly purchasing or storing DOT tokens. Market reactions to the filing have been swift, with analysts and industry commentators debating its significance. On X (formerly Twitter), reactions have varied. A crypto market observer described the filing as “huge” for institutional liquidity and predicted it could expand Polkadot’s market reach. However, not everyone shared this enthusiasm. Source: X A user questioned the role of institutional capital in crypto, humorously suggesting that it felt like – “Someone’s trying to steal my lunch money.” Polkadot’s price has responded positively, despite broader market turbulence. As of 26th of February, DOT was trading at $4.74, a 0.90% increase over the last 24 hours. In contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced sharp declines, with BTC down 6.25% and ETH losing 6.05% in the same period. Source: CoinMarketCap Polkadot’s ability to hold steady while other assets experience losses suggests growing investor confidence, potentially fueled by the ETF speculation. Over the past week, DOT has been on a rollercoaster ride. It peaked at $5.30 on 21st of February before plummeting to a support level of $4.22 by 25th of February. The subsequent rebound aligns closely with buzz surrounding Grayscale’s ETF filing. Trading volume surged to $492.94 million, hinting at heightened interest and the possibility of an approval-fueled rally. Still, caution remains as investors await the SEC’s decision. Quite recently, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s Spot Cardano ETF filing, signaling growing regulatory interest in single-asset altcoin ETFs. While this acknowledgment is not an outright approval, it marks a critical first step. Grayscale’s strategy diverges from that of more traditional asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who typically pursue diversified index-style products. Instead, Grayscale concentrates on single-asset trusts, allowing investors targeted exposure to specific cryptocurrencies without the complexities of direct asset custody. Polkadot, much like Solana and Litecoin, benefits from both decentralization and an active developer ecosystem, factors that enhance its appeal to institutional investors. Bloomberg analysts, including Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, have long tracked regulatory sentiment toward altcoin ETFs. Their assessments give Litecoin a 90% approval probability, Dogecoin 75%, Solana 70%, and XRP 65%. Source: X Polkadot and Hedera still carry an uncertain “maybe” status, indicating that the SEC’s stance on these assets is less clear. The coming weeks will be a litmus test not just for Polkadot’s ETF proposal, but also for the broader trajectory of altcoin ETFs in the United States. For investors and analysts, all eyes are on the regulators. If Polkadot’s ETF application follows in Cardano’s footsteps of formal acknowledgment—and possibly, approval—it could shift the market’s focus toward altcoin-specific products.

Apple Inc. became the latest company in the list of tech giants who have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in US investments, which President Donald Trump claims credit for. The iPhone maker said that it will spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years, hire 20,000 new employees and produce AI serves domestically. An hour after Apple's announcement, Donald Trump said that the company was spending in the US because it has “faith in what we are doing.” However, Apple didn’t directly attribute its investments to the Trump administration. According to Bloomberg, the plan itself isn’t far off from what Apple had previously said it would spend. Since Trump came to the White House as the President eight years ago, corporate pledges have seen taking shape. Now, corporates are revisiting this tradition as the Republican returns to the Oval Office for a second time. Around the start of Trump’s first term eight years ago, Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group Corp. made a commitment to invest $50 billion in the US that, it said, would create 50,000 jobs. Foxconn Technology Group and Intel Corp. were among others that handed Trump spending plans to tout — despite the fact that some were clearly in the works long before he took office. Here are some of the major tech investments announced since Donald Trump returned as the US President: Announced: $500 billion domestically over the next four years Previously: Apple was already expected to spend $10.8 billion on capital expenditures this year. Its operating expenses totaled $57.5 billion in 2024. Jobs: 20,000 Location: Houston and Detroit On Monday, Apple announced what the company described as its biggest US commitment to date. The tech giant is planning to hire 20,000 new workers, produce AI servers in the US and altogether spend $500 billion domestically over the next four years. Investments will include the opening of a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country. The announcement came days after Trump and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook met, after which Trump suggested that Cook planned to invest “hundreds of billions of dollars.” Announced: As much as $500 billion Previously: Stargate is a new JV, but OpenAI had been pitching a plan for a massive data center build-out in the US for months, initially to the Biden administration Jobs: “Hundreds of thousands” Location: Texas, initially On Jan. 21 — the day after Trump was inaugurated — ChatGPT developer OpenAI, SoftBank and software giant Oracle Corp., announced a joint venture to develop AI infrastructure across the US. The firms said they plan to invest as much as $500 billion over the next four years — but are focused on a $100 billion deployment initially — on projects that they estimated would create “hundreds of thousands of American jobs.” Stargate’s first project is a data center complex that spans about 875 acres in Abilene, Texas, that will eventually be used to power AI systems. The joint venture marketed the project as a means of supporting the “reindustrialization of the United States” and protecting “the national security of America and its allies.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had been pitching the Biden administration on a massive AI infrastructure build-out last year. Announced: $100 billion Previously: SoftBank had been laying out plans for months to invest further in AI semiconductors, data centers and robots. Its Vision Fund invested $500 million in the leading US AI startup OpenAI and launched a $1.5 billion tender to buy more stock from OpenAI employees last year. Jobs: 100,000 Location: Texas, for one, through Stargate JV In December, Trump announced that SoftBank planned to invest $100 billion in the US over the next four years during an event alongside CEO Masayoshi Son. The plan includes a pledge to create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure, including investments in data centers, semiconductors and energy, according to a person familiar with the plan. The announcement immediately prompted the question of where the company will get the capital for its latest pledge. During Trump’s last term, Son was raising his $100 billion Vision Fund with money from outside investors and poured the cash into startups such as WeWork, Uber Technologies Inc. and DoorDash Inc. SoftBank doesn’t have the cash on hand to deliver on Son’s pledge this time. Announced: $65 billion Previously: Meta’s capital spending was expected to total nearly $60 billion this year. Its operating expenses topped $64 billion last year. Jobs: N/A Location: Louisiana, for one Meta Platforms Inc. plans to invest as much as $65 billion on projects related to artificial intelligence in 2025, including building a data center “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a Facebook post on Jan. 24. Meta plans to bring around a gigawatt of computing power online in 2025 and is projected to end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the kind of chips critical to running AI systems, Zuckerberg said. He also said the company will “significantly” expand its AI teams, without quantifying the number of jobs to be created. Meta was already heavily investing in AI. Less than three months earlier, Zuckerberg had warned investors that Meta planned to “significantly accelerate” its capital spending in 2025 to bet on AI and the metaverse. The company had announced a $10 billion data center in Louisiana. Announced: Reiterated plans to invest more than $40 billion on US data centers Previously: All plans had already been announced Jobs: Estimated that AI will broadly help create the next “billion AI-enabled jobs” Location: States including Texas and Arizona Microsoft has yet to hand Trump a flashy announcement that he can take credit for. But its president, Brad Smith, did write a blog post in January to welcome Trump into the White House — and lay out investments it had already been planning. Among the plans he mentioned: Microsoft is on track to invest about $80 billion to build data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications, with more than half of that investment located in the US. Last year, the company announced that it would invest more than $35 billion in 14 countries within three years to build “secure” AI and data center infrastructure. The company has previously disclosed plans to build data center capacity in states including Arizona and Texas. It’s also working with BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle to create an international investment fund to add up to $100 billion of additional funding for AI infrastructure and the AI supply chain. Announced: At least $20 billion Previously: Damac had already been laying the groundwork for a larger foray into the data centers business. Edgnex Data Centers, a unit of the Dubai-based conglomerate, had plans to invest $3 billion over the next three to five years in data centers in Southeast Asia. Jobs: “Thousands” Location: Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana Since Trump was first elected in 2016, Hussain Sajwani, the head of Damac Group, wanted the world to know he was the US president’s man in the Middle East. The real estate billionaire thrust himself into the spotlight again in January, standing alongside Trump and promising an investment of at least $20 billion to build new US data centers from Arizona to Ohio. The details of how Sajwani — whose net worth has surged in recent years to about $13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — will finance such an undertaking weren’t immediately apparent. Sajwani, who is likely to lean heavily on banks and other financial institutions for much of that investment, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that Damac’s balance sheet would allow it to fund about 30%. Trump said the first phase of Damac’s plan would span Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana. Damac has said the investment is expected to create “thousands of jobs” where the data centers are built. Announced: $11 billion Previously: Amazon had laid out plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on new data centers long before Trump was elected. The company was already expected to drop nearly $100 billion on capital expenditures this year and had $243 billion in operating expenses last year. Jobs: At least 550 Location: Georgia In January, Amazon Web Services pledged to invest an estimated $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support AI and cloud technologies. The investment is expected to create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs, according to the company’s press release. As part of the investment plan, the company will build new data centers in Butts County, Russ Crumbley, chairman of the Butts County board of commissioners, said in the statement. Announced: Nearly $1 billion Previously: Anduril had already said in August 2024 that it was planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on a new facility. Jobs: 4,000 directly, and another 8,500 to sustain operations Location: Ohio Defense tech startup Anduril Industries Inc. announced in January that it had chosen Ohio as the location of a sprawling new manufacturing facility that will produce tens of thousands of autonomous systems and weapons annually. Co-founder Palmer Luckey had previously said he expected the California-based weapons technology startup to thrive under the Trump administration. Anduril aims to secure final approvals to begin modernizing an existing facility on-site in coming weeks, and expects to begin producing weapons by July 2026. Anduril expects to invest nearly $1 billion in the new facility, which it says will create 4,000 jobs directly, and another 8,500 jobs to sustain operations. The startup had been planning the new facility long before Trump was elected. In August 2024, after raising $1.5 billion in a new funding round, the company said it planned to spend hundreds of millions on the new site.

Title: Foreign Companies Bail Out of China’s Tottering Economy
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/02/25/foreign-companies-bail-out-of-chinas-tottering-economy/
Time Published: 2025-02-25T22:06:53Z
Full Content:
Foreign companies are pulling out of China’s weakened markets, demonstrating a clear lack of confidence in the Communist regime’s ability to stabilize the economy and avert a financial collapse. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Monday noted two more big names headed for the exits over the past two weeks: U.S. law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton this week became one of the latest companies to pull out of China, saying that it would close its office in Fortune Financial Center in Beijing’s bustling central business district in July. Last week, a BlackRock fund forfeited two office towers at Waterfront Place in Shanghai’s premier Lujiazui financial district to Standard Chartered after failing to repay a U.S. $780 million loan that was rolled over for more than a year. The world’s largest asset manager could not find a buyer even after offering a 30 per cent discount. Law firms and real-estate developers appear to be at the forefront of the exodus from China, but other industries are also considering their options as overall profits slipped by almost 18 percent over the past three years. Some foreign firms are evidently concerned that they cannot lower their prices enough to contend with domestic competitors, a concern made worse by the Chinese government’s tendency to bend the rules in favor of domestic companies. The SCMP found it easy to measure the size of the foreign exodus by looking at how much office space has suddenly become available in Beijing at cut-rate prices. Foreign companies make up about 20 percent of the market for office space in China’s capital city, and at the end of 2024, over 20 percent of that space had become vacant. Similar conditions could be seen in the office market for the trade hub of Shanghai, where analysts said 22.1 percent of office space is now vacant. At least ten Chinese cities have passed the “dangerous” threshold of 20 percent vacancy, and the vacancy rate is expected to grow at least 3 percent worse over the coming year. Some of the space vacated by departing Western multinationals is being taken by incoming Middle Eastern corporations, inspired by diplomatic and economic outreach from Beijing, including the investments that are still flowing out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for projects in the Middle East. Some analysts believe President Donald Trump’s crackdown on wasteful foreign aid will give China an opportunity to purchase more influence in the Middle East through BRI. The newcomers do not, as of yet, seem energetic enough to completely replace the U.S. and European companies China is losing. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) belatedly rolled out a twenty-point “action plan” last week to address the loss of direct foreign investment. The European Chamber of Commerce said last Thursday that China’s plan had some “positive” elements, provided the plan is “implemented in a manner that delivers tangible benefits for our members.” MOFCOM announced its plan shortly after China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange released a bombshell report showing that net foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by a whopping $168 billion in 2024, the largest decline since 1990.

Share this article Today, BlackRock transferred 18,168 Ethereum ($44 million) and 1,800 Bitcoin ($160 million) to Coinbase amid growing market uncertainty and widespread liquidations in crypto markets. The deposit comes as Bitcoin fell below $86,000 for the first time since November, while crypto markets experienced $1.6 billion in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Large entities moving significant amounts of crypto to exchanges are often seen as a signal that they may be preparing to sell. This trend can lead to further price drops, as other investors may interpret such moves as a sign of weakening confidence or an impending decline. Market pressure intensified following a $500 million Bitcoin ETF sell-off, coupled with renewed tariff threats from President Donald Trump. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropped to 25, indicating extreme fear and marking its lowest level since September 2024. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

February 25, 2025 13:08 ET | Source: ABC Labs ABC Labs SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reserve Index Protocol introduces DTFs, allowing anyone to create, trade, and redeem crypto index products with instant 24/7 access and real-time transparency. Today, ABC Labs, the team behind Reserve, launches their Reserve Index Protocol, which offers a first-of-its-kind, build-your-own ETF-like experience to crypto. The Index Protocol’s Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs) bring everyday investors and institutions the one-click, easy-to-use experience they’ve become accustomed to since the S&P 500 ETF revolutionized the investing world in 1992. Starting today, 12 index-based DTFs are available, including the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, CoinDesk DeFi Select Index, and MarketVector Token Terminal Fundamental Index by Re7 Labs; the Virtuals Index by Virtuals Protocol; the RWA Index and Large Cap DeFi Index by MEV Capital; and the Alpha Base Index by Altcoinist.com; and more. With over 50,000 new tokens launching daily, DTFs simplify the process of investing in crypto by bundling tokens into broad, diversified crypto indexes or emerging thematic narratives that empower investors to tap into sectors like DeFi, real-world assets (RWA), AI, and memes without the guesswork. Anyone can create a new DTF, and anyone can mint or redeem its tokens 24/7 in a single click. “Our mission is to fight inflation and expand access to better financial products, and we firmly believe that crypto will be an integral part of the future financial landscape.” says Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs. “We built the Reserve Index Protocol to become a ‘decentralized BlackRock,’ which we believe will open up the floodgates of creativity. Plus, by partnering with some of the premier index creators in the world, people can now easily get one-click exposure to this growing industry alongside trusted brand names.”“The integration of the MarketVector’s indexes into Reserve’s DTF platform through our partnership with Re7 Labs is an exciting moment for institutional-grade crypto indexing. By combining MarketVector’s proven methodology with Reserve’s trusted, permissionless infrastructure, we’re making regulated, professional-grade indexes more accessible while maintaining the transparency that institutional and retail investors demand,” says Martin Leinweber, Director of Digital Asset Research & Strategy at MarketVector Indexes. Like an ETF, each DTF unit is redeemable 1:1 for its underlying basket of assets. However, redemption happens via a smart contract, so anyone—not just authorized participants & market makers—can redeem. The underlying tokens remain in this contract, eliminating the need for a centralized custodian. Because DTFs operate on smart contracts, they can be governed by a decentralized body instead of a centralized investment company. The Reserve Index Protocol also adds a powerful new incentive mechanism where creators are given more control over how fees from native tokens launched on the Reserve Index Protocol are divided up. This incentive approach allows DTF creators to form teams, raise capital, offer liquidity incentives, and so on. “While ETFs revolutionized thematic investing, DTFs are completely redefining it. We’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with onchain indexes, unlocking potential that was previously unimaginable. With Reserve’s Index Protocol, this is just the beginning,” says Connor Milner, Partnerships at Re7 Labs.

Title: Dark night for Germany: Elections will change little, and nothing for the better

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory For anyone following German politics, it may be counterintuitive, but things can get even worse. It is true: The “traffic light” coalition that finally imploded last November has left behind a stunning, all-along-the-line record of political, economic, and moral failure. Including but not limited to blindly and self-destructively supporting America’s proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, deindustrializing the German economy, and leading German society in siding with Israel, while the latter is committing genocide – according to both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International – against the Palestinians and going on a rampage among its neighbors. Hard to beat for awfulness, you may well think. And yet after the German election results are in, there are good reasons to be pessimistic, even if it is true that the parties that made up the “traffic light” coalition of doom had their richly deserved comeuppance. The Greens (usually well-off right-wing militarists and vegan woke pronoun sectarians) declined from 14.7% at the last federal elections in 2021 to less than 11.7%, a painful loss for a minor party past its heyday, especially given that it would have been worse without the personal – if inexplicable – popularity of top candidate Robert Habeck. Yet the former minister of the economy – really and in effect, of deindustrialization and recession – seems miffed at having been underappreciated and has promised to no longer claim a leading position in his party. For the SPD (Centrist social-democrats specializing in political insipidness and obsequious obedience to Washington), the punishment was worse; indeed, it was truly catastrophic: With 16.1%, the party notched up its worst result in post-World War II German history. In a longer perspective, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s almost Wagnerian downfall is even more sensational: With SPD forerunner organizations dating back to the 1860s – yes, that would be before the first German unification – this was the party’s worst showing since 1887. And that statistic includes an election in March 1933, when the SPD was already suffering massive Nazi repression: even then, the predecessors of Scholz and co. did better (18.3%). Finally, the FDP (tax-phobic free market doctrinaires) outdid the SPD by getting wiped out so completely it is gone from parliament. It may never return. Its de facto leader Martin Lindner has already announced not only – Habeck-style – his retreat from leadership but from politics as such. Call the above a quantum of justice if you wish. But the election has also featured a great injustice, namely what happened to the left-wing BSW party under Sahra Wagenknecht. Germany has an electoral threshold of 5%. Parties that achieve less are not represented in the federal parliament. The BSW has failed to pass this minimum by an extremely small margin: Garnering 4.97%, it lacked only 13,400 votes. This may be a legitimate result: as Wagenknecht has acknowledged, the party did have real problems to overcome and made quite a few mistakes as well. Yet the BSW is right to seek a verification of this intriguingly close defeat and is considering legal steps. Fabio de Masi, one of its prominent parliamentarians, has posted about “disinformation,” irregularities in the election process, and “Romanian conditions,” a clear allusion to the recent suppression of an “inconvenient” presidential candidate there. While any legal challenge is likely to run into unyielding stonewalling, there is already no doubt that, as Wagenknecht claims, mainstream media have run a long and intense smear campaign against the BSW. Misleading or fake opinion and exit polls – including by the major pollster FORSA (traditionally close to the SPD) – have also, Wagenknecht plausibly argues, helped discourage potential BSW voters. The reason for these dirty tricks is obvious: in neo-McCarthyite style, the party has been systematically maligned as subservient to Russia simply because it wants peace in Ukraine. That the BSW has been the only German party to object to Israel’s genocide has made it even more of a target. The winner of the election is, of course, the conservative CDU (CSU in Bavaria) under ex-BlackRock globalist, hard-right Atlanticist, and fanatically pro-Zionist Friedrich Merz. He is now the chancellor-elect. Yet, in reality, the CDU result of not even 29% is nothing to write home about. It’s enough to win, but definitely too little to boast about. Long gone are the days of heavyweight Helmut Kohl who regularly scored in the 34-38% range. Indeed, the only time when Kohl netted a result similar to Merz’s current one was in 1998, i.e., when he was in obvious decline. The two parties that can really congratulate themselves are Die Linke (The Left) and the Alternative For Germany (AfD) under Alice Weidel. The Left, strongly rebounding from a period of demoralization, captured almost 8% of the vote and the AfD, doubling its 2021 result, nearly 21%. That is as predicted by polls; so, Elon Musk’s clumsy last-minute intervention definitely did not help; it may even have hurt the party in the end. Yet for the AfD, this still marks a historic breakthrough (and I write this without political sympathy): It is simply a fact that the AfD is now the second-strongest party in Germany. The only, fundamentally dubious reason that it will – most likely – not participate in government is that all other parties, including the CDU, insist on treating it as a pariah. Citizens may vote for it – and in ever larger numbers – but the traditional parties claim the privilege of excluding it by a “firewall” (a concept unknown to the constitution, of course) from the ordinary process of coalition-making that really allocates power in Berlin. Whatever you think about their reasons for doing so, it is a hard fact that the mainstream parties are thereby treating the AfD as a second-class party and therefore its voters as second-class voters. In that regard, a recent poll finding is relevant: As Germany’s thoroughly mainstream conservative paper of record Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is reporting, the AfD can no longer be understood as a mere “party of protest.” Instead, its voters mean it when they support it. Their decision is genuine and authentic, whether you like it or not. And the AfD now also has the highest share of voters who are either workers or unemployed. Finally, the AfD is still especially strong, indeed dominant in the former East Germany. Put all of the above together and it is obvious that discriminating against the AfD promotes social and regional polarization. Indeed, not treating Weidel’s party as a normal member of the Berlin club undermines German unity. As things are, Germany will probably see the establishment of yet another “great coalition” between the CDU and SPD. Even while the latter has been diminished as literally never before, together the two still have enough parliamentary seats to govern. The AfD, in any case, is reiterating that it is ready for a coalition with the CDU, which would have a solid, indeed bigger majority and a shared view of the world. For, even if the mainstream conservatives of the CDU are loath to admit it, very little separates them ideologically from the AfD. Indeed, as one smart observer has plausibly argued, in terms of ideology, the true share of the “far-right” vote in this election was 60% - including the CDU, the AfD, and the Greens as well. Yet since the real conflict between the CDU and the AfD is not over “values” but electoral turf and ultimately survival as the go-to for Germany’s future right/far-right vote, their coalition is not likely to happen, not yet. That will leave the AfD, for now, as the most powerful opposition party and free to profit from the predictable dysfunction and self-blockade that the CDU and SPD will, once again, inflict on Germany. By 2029 – or earlier in case of another government collapse – Weidel’s party will find itself in an excellent position to break into government, perhaps even dominate it. In that sense, the AfD has every reason to be optimistic now: one way or the other, the election results and their consequences will play into its hands. But as to the rest of Germany, they won’t be so lucky. For three reasons: First, reduce bureaucracy as you will, raise or lower taxes to your heart’s content, keep talking about initiative and hard work and all that – none of it will overcome Germany’s abysmal economic decline. Except you also address two key issues: namely how to reform or better abolish the so-called “debt brake” that paralyzes economic policy and how to rebuild a pragmatic, normal relationship with Russia, including inexpensive energy for German industry and access to cooperation and markets for German business. Regarding the debt brake, a CDU-SPD coalition would have enough parliamentarians to govern but not to change the constitution. Yet that is what is needed to make a difference there. Hence, not only will the two coalition partners block and sabotage each other; they will also be unable to find enough support from the opposition. And if a compromise should be cobbled together, rely on it: it will be worthless since ineffective. Regarding Russia: Merz and his CDU have already signaled that they intend to be even more belligerent than the “traffic light” coalition. As far as they can imagine loosening the self-strangulating debt brake, for instance, then mostly to pump more money into the military. And make no mistake: With regard to foreign policy, Merz’s declaration of seeking “independence” from the US may sound intriguing. But he remains a rigid, intellectually provincial Atlanticist, mentally stuck in the 1990s, if not the (early) ‘80s. Merz’s idea of going it alone is motivated by nothing better than fear and necessity, as Washington under Donald Trump is getting ready to cut its European clients loose. Worse, where the imagination of, at least, a Gaullist would be required to rebuild European security with instead of against Russia, Merz seems to have no greater vision than, in effect, quixotically trying to make Germany (perhaps together with France as junior partner and nuke provider) replace America inside a shrunken, de facto EU-European-centered NATO remaining frozen in self-crippling Russophobia and daft Cold War reenacting, Kaja Kallas-style. Think of it as a new mutation of Atlanticism that doesn’t even feature an Atlantic anymore. That is, obviously, a sad dead end, militarily, economically, and politically. But trying may still do much damage, for instance by interfering with finding peace in and for Ukraine. Merz has repeatedly posed as a diehard zealot of the Ukraine War; and immediately after the elections, his CDU posted on X that “Ukraine must win the war.” An old German proclivity for endgame delusions seems to be asserting itself. Sorry, Ukrainians: The Americans and Russians may think enough blood has flowed; the Germans want more. And then there is Germany’s worst, deepest, moral failure: Siding with Israel and serving as a de facto accomplice in its many crimes, including genocide. There, Merz has literally rushed to show that he intends to be even worse than his predecessors: Defying the International Criminal Court that has issued an arrest warrant for Israel’s leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the chancellor-elect lost no time inviting the wanted war criminal to Berlin. So much for obeying the law in the country of law and order. Germany has had elections. But there definitely has not been a new beginning. It’s not even a false dawn. Dark night abides.

Title: Time To Turn Bullish On Ethereum? CryptoQuant CEO Spots Key Signals

Ethereum (ETH) has plummeted 11.4% in the past 24 hours, reflecting a broader market downturn that saw Bitcoin (BTC) drop by 8%, XRP by 13.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 12.9%. Despite the sea of red, several leading voices—including CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju—are calling for a more optimistic perspective on ETH. Sharing his “bullish thoughts on ETH” via X, Ki Young Ju argued there has been “no significant sell pressure” despite the recent Bybit hack, pointing out that both on-chain and market data remain neutral. “Exchange selling takes time, and OTC offloads barely affect the price,” he added. He also emphasized Ethereum’s dominant share of the stablecoin market cap—currently around 56% and noted how potential regulatory shifts under the Trump administration, which is reportedly “easing crypto regs,” could spur further adoption of ETH-based stablecoins and smart contracts in 2025. Ju referenced additional catalysts, reminding followers that the ETH spot ETF “is already approved,” suggesting that a “Large Cap ETF altseason” might be on the horizon for Ethereum. He added, “BlackRock ETH spot ETF holdings increased 124% over the past three months.” Lastly, Ju highlighted growing whale accumulation: addresses holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH have increased their balances by 24% over the past year, with the current price “nearing the cost basis of accumulating addresses.” However, Ju admitted he was “surprised” by what he sees as an overwhelmingly bearish mood on Crypto Twitter. “Wow, CT [Crypto Twitter] sentiment on ETH is extremely bearish. Let me know if you have any data-driven analysis to support your bearish thesis. Most bears seem to cite the dropping price itself as their reason for selling. Very interesting,” Ju remarked. On his alternative X account—under the handle @kate_young_ju—he reiterated that “whales are stacking ETH,” pointing to the current cost basis for these accumulating addresses at around $2,199, compared to the spot price hovering near $2,505. Ju is not alone in challenging the doom-and-gloom market narrative. AdrianoFeria.eth (@AdrianoFeria), an member of the ETH community, asserted that “the market is in the shitter” but urged investors to focus on high-level institutional and political signals favoring Ethereum. He specifically cited reports of the US President and family purchasing “hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ETH,” the CEO of BlackRock’s endorsement of tokenization (and BlackRock’s own tokenized USD experiment on Ethereum), and Bybit’s need to buy large quantities of ETH to cover its hack—potentially fueling more demand. Feria also mentioned that Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel believes Ethereum could replace Bitcoin. For this community member, the fact that “everyone on CT is still taking a shit on ETH” only reinforces a contrarian bullish stance. Popular crypto analyst IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) weighed in by posting a chart showing another “red scary candle” but indicating a buy zone above $2,400. Meanwhile, Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, offered historical perspective, reminding followers of 2021’s mid-cycle drawdowns: BTC fell 56%, ETH 61%, SOL 67%, and many other assets 70-80%. According to Burniske, “you can come up with all the reasons for why this cycle is different, but the mid-bull reset we’re going through isn’t unprecedented. Those calling for a full blown bear are misguided.” At press time, ETH traded at $2.382.
