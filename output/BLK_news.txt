The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that Bitcoin (BTC) could see drastically higher prices if sovereign wealth funds begin accumulating. Speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that sovereign wealth funds may drive the price of Bitcoin higher as they look to hedge against “local fears” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Fink’s BlackRock has embraced Bitcoin over the last year, building a $50 billion stash to back its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) which went live in early 2024. In November, it was found that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets – reaching over $33 billion – despite the gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier in 2005. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,607.

Investing.com -- Speaking to Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said he believes Bitcoin could rise to $700,000. Fink said he is a “big believer in the utilization” of Bitcoin as an instrument, explaining that those worried about the debasement of their currencies or the economic or political stability of their countries can have an “internationally based instrument called Bitcoin.” It will “overcome those local fears,” he added. He continued that when speaking with a sovereign wealth fund earlier in the week, the conversation centered on whether they should have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin. “If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin,” declared Fink. However, he clarified: “I am not promoting it by the way. That is not my promotion.” In December last year it was reported that BlackRock said in a report it recommends investors consider an allocation of as much as 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin. “Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and payments system make it a potential diversifier,” said Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock. Given its unique value drivers, we see no intrinsic reason why bitcoin should be correlated with major risk assets over the long term,” the BlackRock report stated.

Title: ByteDance director confident TikTok deal will get done, sees options to avoid an outright sale
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/22/business/bytedance-director-confident-tiktok-deal-will-get-done-sees-options-to-avoid-a-sale/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T17:59:42Z

A major shareholder of ByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of TikTok, said Wednesday he was confident that a deal will be reached to ensure the video-sharing app stays online in the US — and suggested there may be options “short of divestiture” on the table. TikTok received a lifeline this week from President Trump, who issued an executive order delaying enforcement of a national ban by 75 days while China-based ByteDance seeks an American buyer. The app remains online after a brief shutdown last weekend. Bill Ford, CEO of ByteDance shareholder General Atlantic, who also sits on the TikTok parent’s board of directors, said “it’s in everybody’s interest” to hammer out an agreement following Trump’s order. “We’ll get on with it, as soon as maybe the end of the week in terms of negotiating what might work,” Ford told Axios during an event at the annual World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland. “The Chinese government, the US government and the company and the board all have to be involved in this conversation.” Ford also said there might be terms “short of divestiture” that would satisfy US authorities, but did not elaborate. He also placed blame on the Biden administration for not “engaging with us on a real dialogue” before the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline. The Chinese government, which long vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok, changed its tune this week and signaled the company should be allowed to explore a potential deal. General Atlantic and Blackrock are among multiple institutional investors that collectively own a 60% chunk of ByteDance. The company says its executives and employees each own 20%. Trump has vowed to “save TikTok” and said he wants the US to receive a 50% ownership stake in the app as part of a joint venture, though the exact details of his plan remain vague. On Tuesday, Trump said he would be open to his close adviser Elon Musk, who already owns the social media platform X, making a bid to buy TikTok. Trump also invited Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison, whose company is a cloud computing partner for TikTok, to get involved. Other potential buyers include a joint bid floated by billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary, who have said they have $20 billion in commitments as part of a plan to buy the TikTok brand and rebuild its algorithm from scratch on US soil. Another group that includes YouTube star Jimmy “Mr. Beast” Donaldson and Employer.com CEO Jesse Tinsley is also looking to buy TikTok. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is interested in investing in TikTok but said he had paused any bid to buy the app outright, while ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick also was said to be exploring an acquisition in recent months. Any buyer would face an uphill battle to meet the criteria of the bipartisan-pushed law, which requires China to divest ownership of TikTok due to concerns about US national security. China hawks, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), have said any link to the Chinese Communist Party would need to be entirely eliminated. US lawmakers and the federal government say TikTok is effectively a spying and propaganda tool capable of mass data collection and influencing public opinion through its algorithm. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law two days before the deadline, rejecting ByteDance’s argument that it violated the First Amendment. As The Post reported, TikTok remains unavailable in app stores operated by major tech firms Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Under the divestiture law, US companies that facilitate access to TikTok face fines of $5,000 per user. That would amount to as much as $850 billion, given TikTok’s American user base of 170 million.

Title: Building The Business Case For Growth Investment
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephendiorio/2025/01/22/building-the-business-case-for-growth-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T16:08:19Z
Full Content:
A Better Formula For Funding and Executing Commercial Transformation Kristen Carloni leads the global Business Proposal Strategy team for Aladdin Sales and Marketing, a B2B technology business within BlackRock. Her responsibilities center around ensuring an impactful and scalable business proposal process for selling the firm’s financial technology products. From that perch, her team directly impacts the majority of revenues in the business. “The most important, biggest deals come through my team,” says Carloni. “So as a baseline if we don’t do our job the firm is never going to see that revenue, it’s just going to die on the vine.” While Business Proposal Strategy conveys the workings of her job, Kristen’s role defies conventional description. In practice she works across marketing, product, IT and sales functions to leverage technology and AI in ways that help her firm drive faster, more profitable and scalable growth. In other words, she’s a poster child for what is emerging as the next generation of growth leader, a Revenue Operations executive. The description is apt because Kristen is working across silos to better connect teams, data, technology and processes to: 1. Generate more consistent, reliable and profitable revenue growth 2. Improve the return on growth investments in sales, marketing and customer programs 3. Maximize the return on commercial assets like brand, channels, innovation and knowledge assets She’s doing this with a small team of under a dozen people who are impacting over 90 percent of the revenues in the business. At the same time she’s helping the people responsible for the rest of the revenue be more effective in their jobs. And she's in the best position, most importantly, to leverage AI multiplier to drive more scalable revenue growth. A big reason she is so effective is she has adopted the principles and platforms of Strategic Response Management (SRM) which is defined as the people, practice and technology to unlock organizational knowledge for profit growth. Every sales operations, marketing operations, or sales enablement executive can learn a lot from Kristen about creating, quantifying, and communicating the financial impact commercial transformation can have on the business. Why? Because she’s used the principles of Revenue Operations to effectively unlock more of the full potential of the growth investments and assets of her business. And she’s done it from what seems on the surface as a relatively back office “cost center” stuck in the middle of the revenue cycle - the bid and proposal response team. A BETTER BUSINESS CASE FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSFORMATION Generating more consistent and profitable revenue - Unlike typical sales and marketing operations teams, Kristen’s team has the advantage of directly impacting top line revenues. That makes a big difference when it comes to leading commercial transformation in the eyes of leadership. The average B2B response team directly impacts almost one half (48%) of revenues in terms of both customer acquisition (via RFPs) and loyalty and expansion (via Due Diligence Questionnaires) according to APMP benchmarks. They also drive additional revenue by providing market intelligence, self-service knowledgebases, customer insight, and knowledge assets that help improve the overall go-to-market process. As evidence, Carloni’s team has leveraged technology to grow the percent of revenues they directly impact from 70% to 92% of revenues in the past year – with greater productivity, performance and at lower cost. They’ve effectively used the insights and experience drawn from responding to hundreds of customers to inform and improve the efforts of the product, marketing, finance, and sales teams in many ways. Calculating the Probability of winning. Showing where to allocate resources. Identifying the top features customers want. Forecasting future demand 24 months out. Reporting which marketing messages are landing or not. And more. Here are some examples: Improving the return on growth investment. As compelling as these returns are, many sales leaders make the mistake of treating sales productivity as a single solution problem, according to Bob Kelly, the CEO of the Sales Management Association. Instead Kelly advises managers to treat commercial transformation as an equilibrium problem that involves constantly balancing some fundamental tradeoffs such as investing in salesperson up-skilling versus simplifying the selling job; undergoing wholesale transformation versus pursuing incremental process improvements. Kristen Carloni has struck that balance in her efforts to transform the commercial model one dollar at a time at Blackrock. “Our ability to impact sales win rates, productivity, capacity and costs is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the financial impact we’ve delivered when you compare it to the multiplier effect it has had on the return we are getting from our selling assets, IP, and investments,” says Carloni. Academic research reinforces Carloni’s focus on maximizing the return on commercial investments at lower risk. Business leaders that understand the math of growth in a modern business realize that far greater financial impact can be had by managing the allocation and deployment of growth resources, investments and assets such as building customer and brand equity, while mitigating the risks associated with selling. Maximizing the return on commercial assets. Perhaps the biggest financial impact a commercial transformation leader like Carloni can have is to unlock the enormous untapped growth potential of the firms commercial assets. Why? Because the majority of the value in firms is intangible commercial assets – including market-based assets, knowledge assets, computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies like ‘sales know how.’ When properly measured and accounted for, these intangible assets can represent up to 80% or more of the value of a business.

January 22, 2025 09:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q4 2024 Hedge Fund Barometer, showing that heading into 2025 hedge fund managers are positioned conservatively while waiting on market uncertainty to play out. According to the Barometer, the industry’s low conviction levels could be underpinned by reluctance to chase the run-up in assets observed in 2024 or make aggressive bets on weakening assets. Overall, the hedge fund industry posted a modestly positive performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, with overall gross returns of 0.9%, according to Unlimited’s proprietary technology. Event Driven strategies led the quarter with an impressive 2.8% gross return, while Emerging Markets strategies struggled, declining by -2.1% gross. Hedge fund performance in 4Q24 was bolstered by strategic positioning around key global events. Event Driven and Global Macro managers benefited from investments aligned with expectations surrounding Donald Trump’s re-election in November. In contrast, Emerging Markets managers faced headwinds due to the absence of anticipated Chinese economic stimulus, contributing to the underperformance of the strategy. Caution Amidst Euphoria Heading into 2025 Looking ahead, hedge fund managers are displaying caution as they approach 2025.

Title: Inside A Real Estate Billionaire’s Fight To Revive His Aging Empire

Full Content:
OnJanuary 15, real estate billionaire Charles Cohen called Forbes from a no caller ID phone, as he always does. For four months, Forbes had been trying to get Cohen to sit down and discuss the mounting debt and vacancies at the buildings owned by his real estate firm, Cohen Brothers Realty. In September he said to check back in November. In November, he said to call in January. Last week, Cohen said he was going on vacation. He didn’t specify where, but he often jets to his vineyard in the south of France, Château de Chausse, or his Palm Beach penthouse. (He also has apartments in West Hollywood and Manhattan and a sprawling home in Greenwich, Connecticut.) Then he asked if the story could be delayed once again for four to six weeks, when he would explain how his firm had “turned the corner.” “If you run a negative story, it's going to hurt me,” he said, mentioning several refinancings and new leases he claimed were in the works. “It makes it harder for us to rent when people think there's a problem that really isn't a problem." Cohen finally relented, only after Forbes explained the story would run regardless, and had his executive vice president sit down with Forbes to go over financials. There is no doubt that Cohen, who took over his father and uncles’ firm in the 1980s and expanded it by building and buying prime office towers in midtown Manhattan, now finds himself in a tricky spot. Since the pandemic emptied offices, many of his prized properties lost tenants. At least six of his buildings sit more than 20% empty, with three of those less than 60% occupied. At the same time, he’s struggled to make payments on at least $1.1 billion in debt according to loan filings and court documents, resulting in the loss of four properties at a foreclosure auction in November. All of that has dealt a blow to Cohen and his fortune, which peaked at $3.7 billion in 2022, when he was flush with cash and interest rates were near zero. Forbes now estimates he’s worth $1.6 billion. About two-thirds of that lies in his real estate holdings, which have lost value as tenants fled to newer, amenity-rich skyscrapers. Cohen disputes the valuation, claiming it should be higher. Steven Cherniak, Cohen Brothers’ chief operating officer, said that the firm is up-to-date on loan payments for buildings that carry more than half that $1.1 billion debt load. Plus, Cherniak is confident the properties will land more tenants in the first half of this year. Cohen’s troubles made headlines on November 8th, when one of the largest foreclosure auctions in New York history took place. Up for sale were five of his holdings: an 800,000-square foot office and design complex in Dania Beach, Florida, a nearby Le Meridien hotel, a former hotel site in Rye Brook, New York, and theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. At the end of the bidding process, Cohen’s creditor, Fortress Investment Group, walked away with nearly everything, paying just under $150 million for the design complex, hotel, U.K. theater chain and Rye Brook site. No one bothered to bid on the U.S. chain Landmark Theaters, with its 28 locations and concessions business, leaving them in Cohen’s hands. It was the latest episode in a long-running battle between Cohen and Fortress. The lender sued Cohen last March, seeking repayment of a $534 million loan secured by the properties. Representatives for Fortress didn’t respond to a request for comment. Cohen and his company counter-sued. The auction, for which Cohen was a no show, was another setback for the real estate mogul and movie buff. For years, the collection of office towers in midtown Manhattan he’d assembled provided steady profits. He then expanded into design centers and indulged his passion for film, producing several Oscar-nominated films (and one best foreign-language film winner, “The Salesman”), buying arthouse theater chains and launching a film distribution business. He also bought a 135-acre vineyard and estate in France in 2016 and men's high-end footwear brand Harry’s of London a year later. But in the past two years, he’s had to deal with mounting troubles at his office towers. He lost several major tenants—including WeWork, which vacated more than 200,000 square feet at several properties while keeping much less space—and debts racked up as repayment dates loomed. His buildings struggled to compete with brand new skyscrapers with luxury amenities, making it tougher to replace those leases, according to several brokers. High interest rates also made it harder to refinance, and when he did—as with the Fortress loan—it was on unfavorable terms. At the same time, the rest of his empire also took a hit. The pandemic shuttered his theaters across the country, and his design centers lost tenants, too: he lost the one in Florida to Fortress but has three more, including two in Los Angeles and New York where occupancy has dipped below 80%. For his part, Cohen insists the picture isn’t as bad as it looks, pointing to better leasing activity and a recent uptick in sales of office buildings. At one of his properties, 750 Lexington Avenue—home to the headquarters of his firm—the lender filed for foreclosure in May, a month after the building was reappraised at just $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. But the foreclosure has stalled, while one tenant, beauty retailer Sephora, renewed its lease and another tenant, WeWork, kept its lease after emerging from bankruptcy. Cohen Brothers is working on a loan modification with the lender. “We're doing fine. We've got leasing challenges, which everyone has, but we've got good buildings,” Cohen told Forbes in a phone call 10 days after the auction in November. “We have very strong tenant retention and expansion, and we're probably doing more leasing than a lot of other people.” Outside of New York, he’s expecting to break ground soon on a 23-story, glass-clad office tower in West Palm Beach, where demand for office space remains strong, especially for new buildings. “I'm doing everything that I need to do everywhere,” he asserted. Cohen's 750 Lexington Avenue, a 28-story tower with tenants including Sephora and WeWork, is 27% vacant and was reappraised in April 2024 at $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. Cohen was born in 1952 into a real estate family in Harrison, north of New York City. His father, Sherman, was a former car dealer who built Cohen Brothers Realty with his two brothers; the siblings eventually grew it to more than 20 buildings across Manhattan. As a young child, Cohen was more interested in show business, developing a love for movies after his grandmother took him to see Cinderella at age 3. By the time he was a teenager, Cohen was showing apartments for his family’s real estate firm. But he also knew he wanted to become a director and even shot a few short films. “When I turned 14, I stopped following the Yankees and started reading Variety,” he told Forbes in 2017. “There was nothing more exciting to me than being in line to see a movie when it opened.” It would be a while before he pursued his filmmaking dreams. The first in his family to graduate from college, he got his bachelor’s at Tufts University in 1974 and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1977 before working in Chemical Bank's real estate division in New York for a couple of years. He then joined his family’s firm and rose to become vice president and general counsel by 1981. Just two years later, he became president and bought out his father’s and uncle’s stakes in the company for an undisclosed sum. One of his signature deals was the construction of 750 Lexington Avenue. Cohen bought up the entire block between 59th and 60th streets in the 1980s to build it. (One resident on the block held out and refused to sell her townhouse, leading Cohen to build the 28-story tower around it; it’s still there) Cohen expanded into design centers in the 1990s, purchasing the Decoration and Design building in Manhattan for $63 million in 1996 and adding the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the Design Center of the Americas in Florida three years later for an undisclosed sum. By 2009, he had expanded the firm to more than 12 million square feet of real estate—up from 3 million when he took over in the 1980s. At the time, he also pivoted back to his fervor for filmmaking. He put up half the budget for the independent film “Frozen River,” which won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize in 2008, and then set up a movie distribution business the same year. Over the following decade, he picked up a historic film collection, a small-screen theater in Manhattan plus Landmark and Curzon, two theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. He also began spending more time in France, purchasing the Château de Chausse wine estate in Provence in 2016 for $20 million and picking up a historic Japanese-style theater in Paris a year later. He joined The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time in 2016 with an estimated $2.8 billion net worth. That same year, coworking outfit WeWork leased four floors at Cohen's office tower on East 57th St. By 2018, the startup had expanded to 123,000 square feet there and also took more than 80,000 square feet at 750 Lexington. When WeWork’s public listing collapsed in September 2019, Cohen was left with a looming leasing problem as the startup’s cash was predicted to dry up. Six months later, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The downturn was devastating for New York office landlords. By the end of 2020, the value of the city’s office buildings had fallen by 45%, an estimated $50 billion decline, according to a research paper published in 2022 by Columbia and New York University professors Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal and Stijn van Nieuwerburgh. “In the future, this period of time will be called the great valuation reset,” says longtime New York real estate broker Bob Knakal. “People have to get tuned in with the reality of what the present market is.” Cohen, though, had locked in fixed-rate loans on several of his largest properties—including 750 Lexington Ave and the New York design center—in the years before the pandemic. In 2022, as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to battle high inflation, he chose to take advantage before rates got too high. In September that year he refinanced four properties and the two theater chains with a $534 million loan from Fortress. According to financial documents revealed in the Fortress lawsuit, Cohen’s empire was already feeling the pain by the 2022 refinancing. An independent auditor's report compiled in December 2022 stated that the firm was dealing with “net operating losses” and “high vacancy rates” which “raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.” The report also noted that the firm had pursued “significant efforts to increase occupancy and cost control measures” and also had “adequate cash resources and business continuity plans.” In the spring of 2023, Forbes investigated the collapse of commercial real estate values across major cities in the U.S. “You’ve got to be defensive,” Cohen told Forbes at the time, when asked about his strategy to survive the downturn. On his debt, he said: “It’s not an issue of imminent concern to me. We’re keeping lenders apprised of what’s going on, being transparent, explaining why things are the way they are.” Throughout the rest of that year, Cohen and Fortress extended the payment schedule on the loan and deferred payments, according to court filings. In November 2023, WeWork filed for bankruptcy and vacated more than 200,000 square feet at two Cohen properties in Los Angeles and New York—the latter bearing a mortgage owed to Fortress, and where WeWork had leased nearly a third of the total space. Tensions came to a head in February 2024, when Cohen and Fortress were negotiating a further extension. In emails revealed in court records, Cohen pushed back on Fortress' proposal but expressed hope that they would come to an agreement: “Over the last 20-plus years, we have always found a way forward together.” Dean Dakolias, Fortress' co-chairman and managing partner, fired back a blunt response. “Your last proposal was unrealistic and took us several steps backwards,” he wrote. “You’ve not made your last payment, and you’ve not demonstrated that you understand or prioritize the severity of your situation.” The next month, Fortress sued Cohen and demanded full repayment of the more than half billion loan, as well as a personal guaranty of up to $187 million—plus interest—from Cohen. Cohen counter-sued a month later, seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed and alleging that Fortress had reneged on an agreement to extend the loan. Fortress had demanded a foreclosure auction on Cohen’s properties in May, but a judge ruled in Cohen's favor in June and agreed to postpone it. In August, it was put on the schedule for November. In October, Cohen suffered another blow when the judge in the case ruled that Cohen had to pay the personal guaranty on the properties. (Cohen filed an appeal 11 days later, which is still pending.) Still, Cohen appeared to have more than enough resources to foot the bill: he had nearly $300 million in cash and investments as of June last year. According to Fortress, Cohen then attempted to shield his personal assets so they couldn’t be taken from him to cover the guaranty. The firm’s lawyers alleged that Cohen had transferred ownership of his 219-foot, $50 million yacht Seasense and three smaller vessels to offshore entities in the Cayman Islands, while shifting ownership of his $20 million home in Greenwich, Connecticut to his wife Clo, a former Jimmy Choo executive. Cohen hit back, stating that it was just routine estate planning, but Fortress won a court judgment in the Cayman Islands delaying the transfer. Cohen is also fighting the $187 million personal guaranty demanded by Fortress. In a filing ten days after the auction, Cohen's lawyers argued that the auction sales mean that the guaranty amount should be reduced by $75 million to account for the sale of the assets and the release of a lien on another Cohen property. In December, his lawyers also argued that Cohen had nearly $350 million in equity in four buildings—3 Park Avenue, 979 Third Avenue, 805 Third Avenue and 622 Third Avenue— sufficient to cover the remainder of what he owes to Fortress. Once again, Fortress disputed his claim, pointing to the fact that those values were based “on stale, year-old valuations” that have declined since then, and that all four properties are burdened with outstanding mortgages. The proceedings are still ongoing. Cohen's private theater at his Greenwich, Connecticut mansion cost $1 million to build and features a curved movie screen and a sculpture of a ticket collector handmade by a Massachusetts artisan. Outside of the Fortress dispute, Cohen is still saddled with several debt-laden buildings that are showing their age. And while he had less leverage on his buildings than other Manhattan real estate tycoons, he was particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to his concentration in older office towers. “It's difficult for the owner of a Class B office building to make their buildings competitive with Class A product,” says Knakal, referring to older properties compared to newer construction like Hudson Yards or One Vanderbilt, which is fully occupied. “We're talking about declines in the order of 30% to 50% in value on average," adds Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. For real estate moguls with their wealth tied up in office towers, “it means they may no longer be billionaires.” In a bid to entice tenants, many owners of older properties are now offering as much as a year of free rent as well as pricey allowances for improvements. But Cohen sees that as a losing proposition. “We're only doing deals that make sense. A lot of our competition is just throwing money at deals,” he said in November. Cohen insists he’s working on improving his buildings to make them more competitive, arguing that they should be valued higher now due to recent transactions such as a November deal that valued S.L. Green’s One Vanderbilt at $4.7 billion and the December sales of two office towers on Park Avenue. “We're finishing up a major lobby renovation at 622 Third,” he said. “We're reinvesting in our buildings.” Those renovations are now complete, according to chief operating officer Cherniak, including a $13 million new lobby and exterior facade at 3 Park Avenue. Cohen’s also bullish on new lease activity to replace his vacancies. In Los Angeles, the space left by WeWork has been filled by the hospital and health science center Cedars-Sinai, an existing tenant. In New York, the firm expects to sign new leases at five of its least occupied towers in the coming months. Cohen may have a point: Office leasing activity in Manhattan increased 17% year-over-year in 2024, the highest since 2019, according to real estate brokerage Avison Young. Still, older or lower-quality properties made up just 23% of new leasing last year, and rents at those buildings are only about half what’s charged by trophy buildings—a sign that the resurgence in leasing is leaving many of these aging towers behind as tenants continue to opt for newer ones. Another strategy he has: converting office space to residential apartments and condos. In May, his firm filed for a special permit to convert 19 floors of its 38-story tower at 623 Fifth Avenue—across from the Rockefeller Center and atop Saks’ Fifth Avenue’s flagship store—to 172 condos. The project has since been scaled down to 60 to 70 condos, per Cherniak, but the firm is working on design plans. Another condo conversion project at 3 East 54th Street, which has views of Central Park, is further along, with the firm finishing the interior demolition last summer. “They’re all moving forward,” said Cohen. Yet the lender on the 54th Street property filed for foreclosure in December, putting that project in doubt. (Cohen says he is in the process of refinancing the loan.) Another proposed conversion at 135 East 57th Street is now dead in the water. The Wallace family, which owns the ground underneath that building, opposed the conversion project and sued Cohen over unpaid rent in December 2023. In October, a judge ruled in the family’s favor, handing the building over to them. According to New York office brokers who spoke with Forbes, if Cohen is able to follow through on the conversions, work with his lenders on the troubled properties and hold onto the buildings he wants while sacrificing others, he could survive the threats to his empire. As his appeal on the Fortress case works its way through the courts, Cohen is looking south toward his planned 23-story, 400,000-square-foot tower in West Palm Beach, named West Palm Point. Located close by two other office projects being developed by billionaires—Stephen Ross’ One Flagler and Jeff Greene’s One West Palm—the three edifices-in-progess form part of what has been called “Wall Street South,” as financial firms from BlackRock to Citadel open offices in the fast-growing city. Together they will add nearly 900,000 square feet of office space. Cohen’s building there, which is set to break ground in March, is expected to be finished in 2028. He plans to finance the construction with a mix of equity and loans. That could be a smart bet for Cohen, with Donald Trump’s election spurring business magnates and world leaders to flock to Palm Beach for its proximity to the new president’s Winter White House at Mar-a-Lago. According to Cherniak, the firm has already negotiated leases for six floors. “We have all our approvals. The contracting is just about complete and we're getting ready to close our loans and break ground,” Cohen said in November. “We've got leasing activity underway already." As for the legal battles, Cohen is going to keep fighting. “I'm not paying that personal guaranty. I've got defenses, I've got an appeal pending in the appellate division,” he said. “It's not over by a long shot."

Title: BlackRock, Weinstein Reach Truce in Spat on Closed-End Funds

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets. As part of the deal, BlackRock agreed to repurchase a big chunk of the shares in two of its largest closed-end funds at a price close to their net asset values — 50% of outstanding shares in the $1.8 billion Innovation and Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) and 40% of the $1.7 billion Health Sciences Term Trust (ticker BMEZ). Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

On-chain analyst Willy Woo thinks “a race of sovereigns” will catalyze higher Bitcoin (BTC) prices. In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Woo says MicroStrategy kicked off the corporate BTC treasury trend in the previous cycle. He predicts the current cycle will see other sovereign wealth funds follow El Salvador and Bhutan’s lead. “I think this cycle, that starts to come out and the cycles ahead. And so everything becomes a race, and I don’t know if these are big unlocks, I think it’s one step after the next and the next and the next.” Woo says a big moment of the current cycle was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink expressed approval of BTC. “You’re not going to get fired for recommending Bitcoin. Asset managers [previously] would buy it themselves and not recommend it because it was risky for their career. Now I see CIOs at banks not only talking about Bitcoin as an investment but they’re talking about it as the next world reserve currency.” BTC is trading at $105,785 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of more than $108,000 on Monday. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Worries for Ireland as Trump moves on corporation tax

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Ireland’s corporation tax bonanza of recent years has been well documented, but now that Donald Trump is back in office, that particular gravy train may be about to come under threat. US president Donald Trump has moved to pull his country out of a landmark global corporate tax deal, setting up a potential stand-off between his administration and the European Union, with Ireland caught in the middle. Jack Power and Eoin Burke-Kennedy have the details, while Cliff Taylor breaks down just what is at stake in the row. Trump was inevitably the main topic of discussion at the second day of the World Economic Forum at Davos, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and German leader Olaf Schultz among those choosing their words carefully. Eoin is at the forum in the Swiss town, where he also assesses the view on where Trump’s tactics come from. Intel is still betting big on Ireland with the company’s €17 billion Leixlip plant seen as an “critical” to reversing the slide in the once-dominant chipmaker’s fortunes, according to sources close to the company. Eoin has the details. Kilkenny-based nutrition group Glanbia is planning a restructuring of the administrative functions at its Irish locations in a move that will involve up to 60 redundancies, some of them compulsory. As Ciaran Hancock reports, staff have been informed that a new centralised unit is being established – Glanbia Enterprise Solutions – for the delivery of finance, HR and IT services to the business. Some of this work will be outsourced to third-party providers. The economy is currently experiencing a “moderation” in growth, according to Ibec, which is forecasting a slowdown in employment growth in the coming years. As Colin Gleeson reports, the business lobby group’s latest economic outlook is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 1.7 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2026. It says the moderation is “not unexpected”, particularly given the turbulence faced by some of Ireland’s largest trading partners. With the next government set to be formally take power today, John McManus looks at what we can expect from the new(ish) team, and what deals may have been agreed to get a working majority into place. How hard is it to save, really? In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at how a little bit of planning, and consistently setting aside just a few euros per month, can add up quickly. BNY Mellon has announced the closure of its facility in Wexford with about 300 jobs impacted. The global financial firm employs about 310 employees at its offices in the Drinagh Business Park on the outskirts of the town. There had been widespread reports over recent days that jobs at the firm were in jeopardy. Brendan Furlong has the story. Online payments firm Stripe is to make 300 staff redundant over the coming months, including a small number in Ireland, as part of what is understood to be a review of some aspects of its operations. A consultation process has been initiated with the people whose roles are expected to be impacted and this is expected to be complete within a matter of weeks. Emmet Malone reports. The Blackrock Clinic is to create 50 jobs by establishing a women’s health centre over four floors in a new Dublin city centre location “in a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services”, the company said. Gordon Deegan has the story. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance group, is seeking to cut as many as 18 jobs – or almost 12 per cent of roles – within its Irish software technology unit, Munich Re Automation Solutions, as part of a restructuring of the business. In Commercial Property, Fiona Reddan reports that The Morrison Hotel, on Dublin’s north quays, has been put up for sale, with the sellers seeking between €90 million and €95 million.

Title: Paralyzed man flies virtual drone by thought alone

Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:25:29Z

A man with paralysis has been able to fly a virtual drone using only his thoughts. The feat was made possible by a brain-computer interface (BCI) that decoded the man’s brain activity in real time, Nature reported this week. The neural signals were associated with finger movements that enabled control of the virtual drone. “There’s a lot of things that we enjoy or do as humans where we use multiple individuated finger movements, so like typing, sewing, playing a musical instrument,” said Matthew Willsey, the study’s co-author and a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “That’s what this line of work is focused on — how we enable the control of multiple things at the same time.” Willsey added that the experiment could’ve been performed with a real drone but the team decided to use a virtual one for ease and safety. The 69-year-old man who participated in the study told the researchers that controlling the virtual object felt like playing a musical instrument, saying: “Flying [the virtual drone] is tiny little finesses off a middle line, a little bit up, a little bit down.” The man’s BCI was fitted by Blackrock Neurotech and was implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the neural signals received by the BCI’s electrodes to the man’s thoughts, New Scientist explained. The participant first went through a process of learning how to imagine some of his fingers moving in a way that created electrical signals of varying strength, which later allowed him to pilot the virtual drone through an obstacle course. Willsey said that for the participant, the test was the realization of “a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled — he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” BCI technology has made significant advancements in recent years, with companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink also developing a device that is currently undergoing human testing. Once fully developed, a slew of exciting applications could bring significant freedom and independence to those with paralysis. They include allowing people with severe paralysis or locked-in syndrome to communicate by translating neural activity into text or speech simply through their thoughts. It can also enable people to use computers, play games, and operate wheelchairs and robotic prosthetics, and even do things like grasp objects or scratch their face. However, challenges remain with the technology, including medical risks from the surgery required to implant a BCI device. High levels of concentration are also required from the person using the device, with current BCIs correctly recognizing mental commands only about 80% of the time, and up to 30% of users failing to get it to function at all. The health and psychological implications of the technology, including cognitive fatigue and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields, are also not yet fully understood. These and other challenges highlight the need for continued research and development to improve BCI technology, deal with safety concerns, and create appropriate regulatory frameworks. Soccer giant Manchester City this week secured the English Premier League title, beating archrival Manchester United into second place. As part of the celebrations, the club has offered its fans -- as well as anyone with an interest in drone photography -- a stunning fly-through of its modern, 55,000-seat Etihad Stadium. The groundwork is being laid for the quantum internet -- up in the air. Recently, researchers from Nanjing University in China demonstrated that it is possible to send entangled photons between a pair of drones, called Alice and Bob, hovering one kilometer apart.

USYC, or the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, is backed by U.S. Treasury debt and reverse repurchase agreements, with a total asset value of over $1.25 billion, according to RWA data. It comes as multiple businesses seek to tap into an anticipated lucrative boom for real-world asset tokenization. The move is also expected to bolster Circle’s standing against rival and stablecoin giant Tether, which launched its tokenization platform, Hadron, in November. Supporting the integration, Circle has partnered with DRW subsidiary Cumberland, a major institutional crypto trading firm, which will underpin the integration between the fund and Circle’s stablecoin, USDC. Cumberland will expand liquidity and settlement capabilities for USDC and USYC in a bid to drive broader adoption in both crypto and traditional capital markets, according to a statement on Tuesday. The integration is expected to place USYC as a preferred yield-bearing collateral for exchanges, custodians, and prime brokers in both crypto and traditional finance markets, Circle said. Speaking on the partnership, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said Tuesday on X there exists an “enormous opportunity” to “bring yield-bearing collateral to crypto market structures” around the clock. “One of the Holy Grails of capital markets is the ability to move between cash and collateral instantly,” he said. “We are unlocking this with a focus on the well-established crypto capital markets.” TMMFs are blockchain-based digital versions of traditional financial assets, such as Treasury bills, offering faster ways to invest in yield-generating instruments. Plans to deploy native USDC on Canton, a blockchain tailored for secure and private financial applications, were also announced. Canton processes over $3.6 trillion in tokenized RWAs and facilitates more than $1.5 trillion in monthly repo transactions, the companies said. The tokenization of real-world assets, which converts ownership rights of physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, is gaining traction. The total value locked in the sector has risen 36.9% in a year to $7.89 billion, as per DeFiLlama data. That’s expected to balloon to more than $50 billion by some estimates. Spying an early opportunity, the world’s asset manager, BlackRock, launched a fund of its own on Ethereum in March of last year, allowing qualified investors to earn U.S. dollar yields. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), the vehicle reportedly contains more than $500 million in assets under management. “Circle is leading the way in bringing the most important building blocks of money onchain, fostering a more scalable model of global institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure, while also paving the way for onchain money to become the core of traditional financial markets,” Allaire said in his post.

Title: Bitcoin mining revenue hits $45M – Understanding what it means for you
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-mining-revenue-hits-45m-understanding-what-it-means-for-you/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:00:22Z

Bitcoin mining saw a surge in revenue, highlighting potential for sustained growth or a new bull cycle. Bitcoin [BTC] mining has long been a key indicator of market health. Recent spikes in mining revenue and network activity seemed to suggest that the Bitcoin network could be entering a new phase. With daily mining revenue reaching approximately $45 million, current conditions closely mirror the high network activity seen during Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles. However, the big question remains – Does this surge in mining revenue signal the start of another explosive bull run, or is it an indication of sustained growth that is less tied to immediate price fluctuations? The recent surge in Bitcoin mining revenue, reaching approximately $45 million daily, highlights a significant boost in network activity. This hike signals not only a healthy ecosystem, but also heightened miner confidence. As miners continue to secure the Bitcoin network, metrics like hash rate and block difficulty provide valuable insights into its overall strength. A rising hash rate means greater participation and computing power, while climbing block difficulty hints at a more challenging environment for miners. Together, these indicators point to a thriving Bitcoin network that could be gearing up for a new phase of growth. Bitcoin’s historical data revealed a clear correlation between mining revenue spikes and the onset of bull markets. In late 2017 and early 2021, mining revenues soared alongside high network activity and transaction fees, signaling investor enthusiasm and price rallies to all-time highs. For instance, in late 2017, mining revenue surged past $50 million daily, coinciding with Bitcoin’s climb to $20,000. Similarly, early 2021 saw revenues spike to over $60 million as Bitcoin reached $60,000. These surges reflected strong network fundamentals, such as rising hash rates and transaction volumes, which typically precede price booms. Source: Cryptoquant The daily mining revenue of $45 million seemed to align closely with these historical thresholds, suggesting a potential bullish signal. However, the impact of this figure can extend beyond immediate price speculation. It underlined strong network activity, miner confidence, and growing adoption, hinting that Bitcoin’s ecosystem is solidifying. If historical patterns hold, the current mining revenue could foreshadow a significant price rally or signal sustained, steady growth driven by a thriving, secure network. Either scenario would reaffirm Bitcoin’s position as a resilient, maturing asset class. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,551 with a steady upward trend in recent sessions. The RSI at indicated bullish momentum but not yet overbought territory, suggesting room for further upward movement. On-balance volume at -89.25K reflected growing accumulation, supporting the price action. Source: TradingView Historical resistance levels near $110,000 could act as a critical test for continued momentum. If breached, it may signal the onset of a broader bull run. However, sustained volume and a push beyond the RSI threshold of 70 are needed to confirm a strong trend. The press time data supported optimism, but necessitated careful monitoring for confirmation of a sustained breakout. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 Bitcoin mining appears to be entering a phase of sustained growth, independent of traditional market cycles. Increasing institutional adoption by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity is stabilizing the market, while global demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative financial system continues to grow. Technological advancements in mining hardware, such as energy-efficient ASICs, are further enhancing profitability, ensuring miners stay competitive even as block rewards decrease. Long-term trends point to a transformation in mining economics. As block rewards halve every four years, transaction fees are expected to become the primary revenue source, driving miners to adopt renewable energy and cost-efficient practices. By aligning with sustainability and technological innovation, Bitcoin mining may well-positioned for continued growth and relevance in the evolving digital economy.

Title: Commission of investigation into abuse in schools ‘a priority’ for new government
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/01/22/commission-of-investigation-into-abuse-in-schools-a-priority-for-new-government/

A commission of investigation into abuse in schools, including private fee-paying schools, will be “a priority” for the new government, Minister for Education Norma Foley has said. In a letter to survivors this week, she assured them “that there has been no let-up in the work being carried out by the high-level group that I set up to progress the establishment of the commission of investigation” into abuses in the schools. Noting that she herself was “part of the negotiating team during the talks on the formation of a new government”, she was “pleased to say that the programme for government contains a specific provision in relation to the next steps following the report of the scoping inquiry”. [ Further 12 Spiritan abuse survivors come forward since September’s scoping inquiryOpens in new window ] This, she said, stated that: “Cognisant of the experience of survivors of historical abuse and in line with their wishes as per the scoping inquiry of Mary O’Toole SC, we will as a priority establish and support the work of a commission of investigation as agreed by Cabinet in September 2024.” Last September, the Government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Ms O’Toole. The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. [ Abuse report: Full list of 308 schools and case numbers detailedOpens in new window ] Last September’s scoping inquiry report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. In her letter this week, Ms Foley said the high-level group to which she referred had also been asked to consider other recommendations of the scoping inquiry report, related to “redress, child protection and memorialisation”. “I am conscious that you and other survivors want to see early action, and so the group was asked to report as quickly as possible. I can confirm that its work has been progressing well and it expects to report shortly,” she said. [ Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at CabinetOpens in new window ] She hoped her letter would assure survivors “of the ongoing commitment of government in responding to the appalling historical sexual abuse experienced by survivors which was set out in the devastating accounts contained in the report of the scoping inquiry”. Expressing her “personal gratitude” to survivors “for engaging in the process”, she said she was “conscious that your courage has inspired, and will inspire, many others to step forward and share their experiences. I will also be forever grateful for the open, honest and honourable manner in which so many of you engaged with me on a personal basis. Thank you.” Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wachtell Lipton Discusses Court Ruling that BlackRock’s Inclusion as Investment Manager Breaches ERISA Duty of Loyalty
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/01/22/wachtell-lipton-discusses-court-ruling-that-blackrocks-inclusion-as-investment-manager-breaches-erisa-duty-of-loyalty/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T05:01:03Z
Full Content:
The District Court for the Northern District of Texas recently ruled that a company breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) for permitting BlackRock’s inclusion as an investment manager of its employees’ retirement assets in a 401(k) Plan. After a four-day bench trial, the Court found that the company failed to “loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests by allowing their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan.” Core to the Court’s holding is its evidentiary determination that BlackRock “pursues a pervasive ESG agenda” that “covertly converts the retirement plan’s core index portfolios to ESG funds,” and that this harms the financial interests of 401(k) participants. As we have noted in prior memos, including The Future of ESG: Thoughts for Boards and Management in 2024, the politicization of ESG has led to “anti-ESG” legislation in several states and a general corporate and investor retreat from use of the term. BlackRock itself has publicly disavowed the term and recently began expanding voting choice programs to include voting policies that oppose energy transition and decarbonization efforts to appeal to a wider swath of its client base and allay the concerns of regulators. The Court ruling notes these recent moves, including BlackRock’s 2024 announcement that it was leaving Climate Action 100+, citing these distancing efforts as “telling” evidence of BlackRock’s “apparent recognition” that ESG investing was problematic under ERISA. The Court found that the company “turned a blind eye to BlackRock’s ESG activism,” and did not sufficiently “monitor, evaluate, and address” the extent to which BlackRock was pursuing a “non-pecuniary ESG investment strategy.” The ruling described BlackRock’s influence over the company—as one of the company’s largest shareholders and a significant debt holder—as the explanation for the company’s “lack of accountability with respect to BlackRock.” This ruling adds an additional layer of consideration for companies and boards seeking to navigate the evolving regulatory and legal landscape on ESG matters. It remains an appropriate and essential part of business judgment for companies to evaluate how key business risks—including those related to the environment, employees, and communities in which companies operate—may impact long-term performance. A number of companies are carefully crafting how they message their policies and thoughtfully considering the specific language they are using. Companies need to continue to be mindful of the current environment as they chart their path forward. This post comes to us from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. It is based on the firm’s memorandum, “District Court Rules BlackRock’s Inclusion as 401(k) Investment Manager Breaches Company’s ERISA Duty of Loyalty,” dated January 13, 2025.

Title: The end of ESG and ‘sustainability’ nonsense?

Time Published: 2025-01-22T01:56:00Z

By John Stossel January 21, 2025 “Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet U.N. sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently, the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!'” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: “They will invest into climate-related efforts,” he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism – producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

It was not working before, due to the stack limitation. Your local Alchemist was not holding out on you, they just weren’t getting procs until the fix above was implemented.

Title: BlackRock and Weinstein's Saba reach settlement in battle over closed-end funds

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Saba Capital Management announced a standstill in a long-raging battle over the future of closed-end funds with the asset manager buying back shares in two portfolios and the hedge fund dropping demands for deep management changes. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said it will buy back 50% of outstanding shares in its BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust and 40% of outstanding shares in Health Sciences Term Trust for a price of 99.5% of each fund's net asset value. A total of roughly $1.6 billion is being tendered in these funds alone, more than has ever been available to investors. In return, Saba, a large owner in BlackRock's closed-end funds, agreed to stop its campaigns at dozens of BlackRock funds calling for fresh directors to be installed and for BlackRock to be fired as some of the funds' manager. The agreement lasts for three proxy seasons. "This is a monumental outcome for shareholders," Saba's founder Boaz Weinstein wrote on social media platform X. He said the settlement shows how shareholders and managers can find a "win-win" solution. "By committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors." Saba's Weinstein has for years waged a battle against closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other companies that oversee billions of dollars, arguing they charge high fees and deliver lackluster returns with limited opportunities for average investors to get their money out. The settlement comes some seven months after BlackRock shareholders voted at 10 of its closed-end funds to keep the asset manager's directors in place and retain it as the manager at six funds. Saba has long criticized the gap between the assets held by closed-end funds and their share prices and wanted to install new directors and at some funds fire the manager. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, don't issue or redeem new shares, which can leave them trading above or below the value of the securities held by the fund. Weinstein has been crusading against these types of portfolios for some time and late last year took his fight overseas by urging shareholders in seven UK investment trusts to replace directors and install his hedge fund as the manager. He argued the current boards failed to deliver "sufficient shareholder returns." (This story has been corrected to say that investors voted at a total of 10 funds, not 4, in paragraph 7)

More Info A few years ago, the world’s biggest banks and asset managers raced to commit to funding the energy transition and drop fossil fuel projects from portfolios as they came under shareholder and market pressure to join net-zero alliances. But after years of scrutiny and blacklisting from Republican states in the U.S. and lawsuits from Republican attorney generals, North American banks and asset managers began quitting net-zero alliances en masse following President Donald Trump’s election victory. Net Zero Exodus The top U.S. banks and four of Canada’s largest banks are no longer part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Now several European banks are considering withdrawing from the NZBA, too, while the leading figures of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) – the umbrella group for the finance institutions that have pledged net zero goals – are struggling to hold their regular annual meeting this month, the Financial Times reports, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. Some of Europe’s biggest banks are rethinking their membership and involvement in net-zero initiatives as Donald Trump returns to office and Republican-led U.S. states are going after “woke capital.” This, they say, discriminates against America’s oil, gas, and coal industry by committing to net-zero portfolios and adopting principles that could reduce financing for fossil fuel projects. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the NZBA. Commenting on the banks’ withdrawals, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, “More and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance. “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, early this month quit the parallel Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Trump was elected U.S. President. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients. Net Zero Under Scrutiny BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. Since leaving the net-zero asset managers’ alliance, BlackRock has reached a settlement with the state of Tennessee, which had sued the world’s biggest asset manager for misleading consumers regarding the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in its investment practices. The settlement concluded a lawsuit filed by the State of Tennessee under the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). “The Americans are totally obsessed about not being sued by Texas. The banks have been the worst,” a European executive involved in the Glasgow initiative told FT. Canadian banks BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group, and CIBC also quit the net-zero banking alliance last week. European lenders have threatened to follow suit unless NZBA eases rules and ends “all formal tracking and any issues that are perceived contrary to US antitrust”, according to FT’s sources. The asset managers’ net zero alliance is already struggling under the pressure. A week ahead of President Trump’s inauguration, the Net Zero Asset Managers said it was launching a review of the initiative. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” the alliance said. While the review is ongoing, the initiative is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. European banks want the net-zero banking alliance to undergo a similar overhaul. Otherwise, they have threatened to quit and follow in the footsteps of the biggest U.S. and Canadian banks. “Several banks have said that unless the banking alliance goes the same way [as] the asset management initiative, they will begin the process to leave,” a source familiar with the banks’ thinking told FT.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Steve Cohen’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stands against other Billionaire Steve Cohen’s top stock picks. Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers in the world, known for his extraordinary trading acumen and ability to generate consistent returns. As the founder of Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has built a reputation as a pioneer in the hedge fund industry. He was born in 1956 into a middle-class family. His father worked in the garment industry, while his mother was a piano teacher. Cohen showed an interest in finance early on, even dabbling in poker, which honed his skills in risk-taking and probability analysis. He graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 with a degree in economics. Shortly after, he began his career on Wall Street as a junior trader at Gruntal & Co, where he quickly gained recognition for his ability to generate profits through equities trading. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In 1992, Cohen founded SAC Capital Advisors with $25 million, including $10 million of his own savings. The hedge fund, named after his initials, focused on long/short equity strategies and became known for its aggressive trading style. Over the years, SAC Capital emerged as one of the most successful hedge funds in history, consistently delivering double-digit returns. At its peak, SAC Capital managed over $16 billion in assets. Cohen reportedly generated annualized returns of approximately 30% for his investors, an extraordinary achievement in the hedge fund industry. Cohen’s trading style emphasized speed, precision, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. In 2014, Cohen launched Point72 Asset Management, a firm focused on managing his personal fortune and eventually reopening to external investors. Point72 has since grown into a major player in the hedge fund industry. As of the third quarter of 2024, Point72 manages over $39 billion in 13F securities. The firm employs over 1,800 people and operates across multiple global offices. Point72 combines Cohen’s expertise in active trading with investments in technology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, positioning itself at the forefront of modern finance.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Point72 Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A physician and a patient having a discussion in a hospital about biopharmaceutical medicines. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 Point72 Asset Management’s Stake: $193.2 million Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a California-based biotechnology company founded in 1987. The following features make this company a strong investment case. Firstly, the report for the third quarter of 2024 indicates the company’s success in expanding its product offerings and capturing demand in critical healthcare segments, which may attract investment. For instance, as per the report, product sales increased 7% to $7.5 billion compared to the same period in 2023 and total third-quarter 2024 product sales, excluding Veklury, increased 7% to $6.8 billion compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV as well as in Oncology and Liver Disease. Secondly, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) presented the results of the pivotal Phase 3 PURPOSE 2 trial, which is studying twice-yearly lenacapavir, the company’s injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, for the investigational use of HIV prevention.

Calamos’ first “Protected Bitcoin ETF” will hit the market Wednesday, offering investors 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price with limited upside potential. From retail investors to financial advisors, Bitcoin’s risk profile has deterred a notable number of market participants who may be wary of Bitcoin’s steep drawdowns despite its growing adoption, Calamos Head of ETFs Matt Kaufman told Decrypt. “Calamos has built Bitcoin exposure with a safety net, and you can choose how low that safety net goes,” he said. “Bitcoin is a historically extremely volatile asset, and so a lot of people have been on the sidelines watching this experiment turn into an institutional reality.” Calamos’ ETFs will be listed on the Cboe, with its 100% Protected Bitcoin ETF set to debut at a price of $25 Wednesday. The product’s so-called cap range, expected to be anywhere between 10% to 11.5%, will be struck at the end of the day. From that point on, the ETF will aim to offer 100% downside protection against Bitcoin’s price, with a cap range struck again next year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the U.S. last year, notching $36.2 billion worth of net inflows as investors and traders flocked to products from Wall Street giants like Fidelity and BlackRock. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has climbed 133% from $46,000 to nearly $107,000, yet some analysts say that registered investment advisors and wirehouses are still warming up to such products. Among institutional investors, 48% of those surveyed in 2023 said that digital assets’ price volatility was a considerable obstacle from an investment standpoint—citing that factor more than anything else, according to a Fidelity Digital Assets report. Meanwhile, 22% of respondents pointed to self-custody concerns, which spot ETFs largely availed. In two weeks, Calamos—which was founded in 1977—will launch additional ETFs with 80% and 90% downside protection against Bitcoin. Those products will have an estimated cap range of 28% to 31% and 50% to 55%, respectively. The products’ risk management framework will be achieved through a combination of U.S. Treasuries and flex options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index, according to Calamos’ website. Flex options are essentially customizable exchange-listed options, which can have a one-year outcome period, as opposed to expiring on the final Friday of each month, Kaufman said. Calamos, which has $40 billion in assets under management, launched similar products covering the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last year. Though the products could find use among a professional investment crowd, Kaufman posited that the products could also cater to investors beyond the typical age of your typical crypto bro. “The adoption for Bitcoin has been on the individual or retail level, and it's largely been people younger than myself,” the 45-year-old Kaufman said. “We haven't seen too much of the adoption curve from those older investors, largely because of the risk tolerance that they just can't take.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

By Doyinsola Oladipo (Reuters) -Three days after ByteDance's TikTok went dark and then was quickly revived in the United States, users who deleted the app were anxiously checking iPhone and Android devices to find it still unavailable to be downloaded again. Some looking to make a quick profit from TikTok fans' desperation listed devices on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) with the app purportedly downloaded for up to $50,000. TikTok still could not be downloaded from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google app stores in the United States on Tuesday, trapped in legal purgatory by the two tech giants. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday delaying the enforcement of a ban on the Chinese-owned popular short-video app by 75 days, the legality of which is unclear. TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, but it was yet to return to app stores. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including Lemon8 and CapCut, were also no longer available. Meanwhile the search to find a buyer for TikTok continued. Trump said on Tuesday he was open to billionaire Elon Musk's buying the app if the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO wanted to do so. And the chair of the House Select Committee on China, John Moolenaar, met businessmen Kevin O'Leary and Frank McCourt about the potential divestiture of TikTok. Billionaire businessman McCourt's Project Liberty consortium has made a formal offer to buy it, valuing the app without its algorithm at around $20 billion. O'Leary joined the effort, Project Liberty said earlier this month. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, O’Leary said he would be interested in a TikTok deal, but it’s not possible under current law. "That 50/50 deal, I would love to work with Trump on, so would every other potential buyer ... But the problem with some of these ideas is they are inconsistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court," the investor told CNBC. The back-and-forth has brought out mixed feelings from users, including some who planned to abandon TikTok after seeing Trump so heavily involved in the negotiations that could result in TikTok eventually being sold to one of his allies in the tech industry. "I do not want to continue being a pawn in this hellscape. I am not saying it will make a difference to TikTok but it will make a difference to me," said Nicole Norman, a TikTok user, on Meta's Threads app. "I will not be back on TikTok." Others, however, want TikTok back, which is not possible as long as Apple and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do not make it available. "I’ve been checking every day," said travel content creator Lauren Scott. Scott, 29, currently in Brazil, read in some Facebook (NASDAQ:META) groups that Americans abroad may be able to access the app if they deleted and re-downloaded it. But that proved not to be the case, leaving her in limbo. The delay may be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app, according to analysts. A notice on Apple's App Store said: "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in". Google Play showed: "Downloads for this app are paused due to current U.S. legal requirements." Some users have been tinkering with multi-step processes to gain access, such as trying to change their location in their phones. "Really hoping TikTok comes back to the app store ASAP, not wanting to do any of that VPN stuff to get it back," said Lauren Nader, a TikTok user, on Threads. Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. legislators last year passed a law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court requiring ByteDance to either sell TikTok or face a ban, citing national security concerns. Many Democratic and Republican lawmakers still want to see ByteDance sell the app. Trump suggested the United States government should be a half-owner of TikTok's U.S. business in return for keeping the app alive, and warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a deal. China indicated this week for the first time it would be open to a transaction keeping TikTok operating in the United States, with its foreign ministry saying on Monday that companies "decide independently" on matters of their operations and deals. Some users still on TikTok have suggested that the app's algorithm is "feeling different" since it came back online, fanned by fears about the future of the tool under a new ownership structure. TikTok welcomed users back on Sunday with the message, "Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!" "I deactivated my account after it was 'back' this morning. I'm done with [Trump] taking credit for the messes he starts," said TikTok user Janel Samson on Threads. Over 200 iPhone and Android devices with the app downloaded were listed on the site for sale as of Tuesday night.

Title: TikTok Might Never Be Listed On Apple’s App Store Again, Unless It Cuts Ties With Parent Company ByteDance And Is Acquired By A U.S. Entity
URL: https://wccftech.com/tiktok-might-never-appear-on-apple-app-store-except-for-one-condition/
Time Published: 2025-01-21T21:00:06Z
Full Content:
The ban on TikTok enforced by the government was superseded by an executive order signed by the new U.S. President Donald Trump that allows the short-video-uploading platform to be shielded by this ban for 75 days. In short, it has been a roller-coaster ride, one that Apple and Google have been forced to be a part of since the app was listed on each company’s online store. The reason for banning TikTok comes from its ties with parent company ByteDance, with the authorities believing that the app presents a national security risk to the nation. Despite the executive order signed, Apple and Google have yet to re-enlist TikTok on their respective app stores, and from the looks of it, both technology giants will maintain this stance unless a U.S. firm acquires the video-hosting service. Assuming that it was not clear before, Apple has mentioned the following details in a new support document, summarizing that TikTok and all other applications that have been developed and controlled by ByteDance will not be available to download or update on the Cupertino firm’s App Store. “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.” To clear the confusion, even though Donald Trump has signed an executive order, which protects TikTok and its supporting partners from a ban for 75 days, various experts have stated that the federal law will remain in place, regardless of Trump’s executive order. The only exception for TikTok to continue working in the U.S. is if the newly elected President can prove to Congress that the video-uploading platform has severed its ties with ByteDance and is now owned by a U.S. entity. Since none of the above conditions have been met so far, it is no surprise that Apple and Google are unwilling to bring TikTok back to their app stores, as such an action would likely result in exorbitant fines. For those wondering, 60 percent of TikTok’s ownership comprises of institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and the Carlyle Group, with its founders and global employees owning 20 percent each.

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets.

Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Chen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities.

Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry. In 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 Shanda Asset Management's Stake: $121.4 million NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company's investment potential is driven by following several factors. To begin with, the investors may consider the company’s financial growth as a top factor. As illustrated in the report of the third quarter of 2024, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per diluted share was 0.78 dollars, up 16% from the previous quarter and up 111% from a year ago. Additionally, the company’s quarterly net income was 19.3 billion dollars, up 16% from the second quarter and up 112% from a year ago. The second most compelling factor that may attract investment is the launch of its project DIGITS, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer capable of running 200B-parameter models. Moreover, the firm has launched the NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs, and services that enable developers to integrate OpenUSD, NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies, and generative AI into existing software tools and simulation workflows for industrial and robotic use cases. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
