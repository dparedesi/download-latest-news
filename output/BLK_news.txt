Title: Calls for review of east coast railway protection plan

Samantha Libreri Eastern Correspondent Plans aimed at preventing the railway line between south Dublin and Wicklow from falling into the sea in future years could result in major changes along parts of the eastern coastline. Irish Rail wants to place large boulders on a number of beaches and raise sea walls, blocking the view of Dublin Bay on parts of the train journey to try to stop the impact of extreme weather events and coastal erosion on the track, which has already lost lands around it of up to 30 metres over the past decade. But opponents say the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project needs to be reconsidered. Watch: Iarnród Éireann's Cian Lynch on the rail line Iarnród Éireann said the 65km of track that runs from Merrion Gates in south Dublin to Wicklow harbour is vulnerable to the effect of storm surges and climate change. To make the rail more resilient it is planning significant interventions at five locations along the route, which include placing large boulders on a number of beaches along the east coast, including White Rock in Killiney. Project Manager of the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Project Cian Lynch said they are proposing the measures to limit disruption of services and to future proof the rail infrastructure. "In recent years, we in Irish Rail have seen more and more occurrences of wave over topping, coastal erosion along this line that necessitates more and more maintenance works, which also results in disruption for services. "As climate change takes hold, that is getting more challenging for us and we do foresee that it will impact services if we don't do something about it now. So several years ago, we took a decision to take a strategic look at this line and to provide more long term permanent protection to coastal erosion and wave over topping, and to factor in climate change as well." The plans include placing large boulders on a number of beaches and raising sea walls in places which will obscure the view of Dublin Bay along parts of the rail journey. Mr Lynch said the measures have been amended in places following an initial public consultation and are being proposed to target particular issues on each of the five locations. "It is quite a scenic and well-known piece of rail infrastructure across the world, and it's very popular for being so close to the sea, that obviously means it is quite exposed. We have just a number of issues at play. "On Killiney beach it's predominantly erosion of the embankments that supports the rail line, further north between Merrion and Seapoint it's wave overtopping and as we head further south towards Wicklow it is more of an erosion issue. So the solutions we're proposing have been adapted to suit the particular locations and to deal with the specific issues in those areas." He said part of the sea walls will be made of glass to allow for a view near some rail stations and that while the size of some beaches may be reduced due to the erection of boulders, access routes to the public will be maintained and improved in some places. 'Compromise' needs to be found However, some believe the plans need to be reconsidered. Fine Gael local representative for Blackrock Cllr Marie Baker said she believes the plans have been over engineered and do not take into account the human impact of the proposed changes. "I fear that it would mean you'll be actually in a DART with your view totally blocked of Dublin Bay and that worries me. I understand they need to secure the line into the future from climate change and storms. We've seen it in the past, unfortunately. But I think what they're proposing seems draconian, to say the least. "A little bit of the crack the nut with a big hammer. I think they need to be more conscious of people's views. I think they need to find a compromise. I can understand that we're going to lose some of our view in Dublin Bay. But do we need to lose it all? I just feel they need to interrogate that a bit more. "I think their proposal is over engineered. I think they need to think about people. There's things there that I don't think have been thought about. I think it would bring lots of sadness to people." Irish Rail said it is eager to receive feedback on the plans as part of its own public consultation which runs until 13 October. A statutory public consultation process will then follow and subject to planning permission, it hopes to begin work, which is estimated to take two to three years by 2029. These five Coastal Cell Areas make up ECRIPP, and are: · CCA1: Merrion to Dún Laoghaire · CCA2-3: Dalkey Tunnel to Shanganagh - Bray Wastewater Treatment Plant · CCA5: Bray Head to Greystones North Beach · CCA6.1: Greystones South to Newcastle · CCA6.2: Newcastle to Wicklow Chief Executive of Iarnród Éireann Jim Meade said: "To provide the best possible solution we want to hear from our neighbours and those that enjoy the coastal amenities along this route and I would urge as many people as possible to give us their feedback". Irish Rail said more details of the plans are available on its website. Eastern Correspondent © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

The newly formed firm edged out established bidders after prediction markets and validator commitments swung heavily in its favor, capping one of the most closely watched governance decisions in crypto this year. Ethena, once considered a strong challenger, withdrew from the race on Thursday. The firm cited feedback from validators and community members questioning whether its proposal, anchored in its existing non-native infrastructure, met the spirit of the competition. Its exit further pushed prediction odds on Myriad for Native Markets above 90% and effectively cleared the path, with Paxos left trailing despite revising its proposal midweek. Disclosure: Myriad Markets is owned by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan. Despite the broad concurrence, the voting process drew criticism. Observers argued the compressed request-for-proposals timeline, combined with validator ties to existing Hyperliquid infrastructure, tilted the playing field in favor of Native Markets. Max Fiege, founder of Native Markets, outlined a phased rollout in a statement on Sunday. The first step will be the introduction of a Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal, after which mints and redeems of USDH will begin in a controlled trial. Early participants will be capped at about $800 per transaction to stress-test the system. Once initial checks are complete, the USDH/USDC spot order book will open on Hyperliquid, followed by full minting and redemption functionality for all users. With Native Market securing the USDH ticker, the closely watched governance vote “cements Hyperliquid as a fast-growing ecosystem” but also shows the “intensifying stablecoin competition,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. Governance-led moves and fresh liquidity being poured into Hyperliquid show that “stablecoins remain central to crypto’s next phase of global adoption,” Liu added. Native Markets had been the frontrunner throughout the contest. Its proposal emphasized a native alignment with Hyperliquid: cash reserves and U.S. Treasuries managed by BlackRock off-chain. Tokenized reserves, meanwhile, will be handled on-chain by Superstate through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin infrastructure provider. The team also pledged to split all reserve yield equally between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and ecosystem growth. Backers include operators and investors with track records at Uniswap Labs, Paradigm, and Polychain. These elements, combined with early validator endorsements from groups such as CMI Trading, gave Native Markets a decisive advantage. Still, USDH’s biggest test will be “breaking through the dominance of USDC and USDT, where adoption and liquidity remain king,” Liu noted. “Transparency around reserves and strong, unified governance will be vital to win lasting trust,” with its future prospects highly dependent “on proving it can compete while maintaining stability,” he added.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Native Markets Wins Right to Issue USDH After Validator Vote

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Hyperliquid’s validator community has chosen Native Markets to issue USDH, ending a weeklong contest that drew proposals from Paxos, Frax, Sky (ex-MakerDAO), Agora, and others. Native Markets, co-founded by former Uniswap Labs president MC Lader, researcher Anish Agnihotri, and early Hyperliquid backer Max Fiege, said it will begin rolling out USDH “within days,” according to a post by Fiege on X. Native Markets has been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid.Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward. According to onchain trackers, Native Markets' proposal took approximately 70% of validators' votes, while Paxos took 20%, and Ethena came in at 3.2%. The staged launch starts with capped mints and redemptions, followed by a USDH/USDC spot pair before caps are lifted. USDH is designed to challenge Circle’s USDC, which currently dominates Hyperliquid with nearly $6 billion in deposits, or about 7.5% of its supply. USDC and other stablecoins will remain supported if they meet liquidity and HYPE staking requirements. Most rival bidders had promised to channel stablecoin yields back to the ecosystem with Paxos via HYPE buybacks, Frax through direct user yield, and Sky with a 4.85% savings rate plus a $25 million “Genesis Star” project. Native Markets’ pitch instead stressed credibility, trading experience, and validator alignment. BTC: BTC has recently reclaimed the $115,000 level, helped by inflows into ETFs, easing U.S. inflation data, and growing expectations for interest rate cuts. Also, technical momentum is picking up, though resistance sits around $116,000, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: ETH is trading above $4600. The price is being buoyed by strong ETF inflows. Gold: Gold continues to trade near record highs as traders eye dollar weakness on expected Fed rate cuts.

Title: Proxy firm critics say they’re calling the shots in corporate America

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. Lawmakers in Washington are sounding the alarm over little-known shareholder watchdogs that they say are quietly shaping decisions at the nation’s largest companies. The two players at the center of the storm are Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, which dominate nearly the entire proxy advisory market. Both companies play an outsize role in guiding how major institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street vote on everything from executive pay and board seats to hot-button policies tied to climate policy and workplace diversity. What started as a simple “cheat sheet” for busy investors has, according to critics, morphed into a system where ISS and Glass Lewis effectively steer corporate decision-making. That influence boiled over at a heated House hearing last week, where Republicans accused the firms of acting like unelected regulators. Much of the fight centers on Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act, which lays out the process for shareholders to put proposals on a company’s proxy ballot. Republicans say the rule has been stretched far beyond its intent, enabling activists to force votes on divisive social issues that have little to do with shareholder value. Democrats counter that 14a-8 is one of the few tools ordinary investors have to hold corporate boards accountable. Rep. French Hill (R-AK), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, argued the firms’ influence has ballooned in recent decades, raising doubts about whether they still serve investors. “We’ve seen the shareholder proposal process diverted away from the critical business strategy focus and instead become a tool for advancing proposals to distract from companies’ missions, leading to an erosion of shareholder value and costly burdens on companies,” Hill said during the hearing on Wednesday. Other Republicans piled on, saying the proposal process has been hijacked. Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) pointed out a Cummins proposal to link executive pay to climate goals, a diversity, equity, and inclusion data-reporting resolution at Eli Lilly, and a request at Coca-Cola for a report on the risks the company faces from state abortion restrictions. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-MI) was more blunt: “Two proxy firms should not be deciding how trillions of dollars in shareholders’ votes are cast.” Shareholder activism has already left its mark on some of the country’s best-known companies. After repeated pressure from investors, Amazon agreed to conduct a racial equity audit of its workforce practices, a move overseen by an outside law firm. Tesla’s $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk became another flashpoint, with both Glass Lewis and ISS urging shareholders to vote it down. Another corporate heavyweight, JPMorgan Chase, faced proposals demanding more detailed disclosures about its fossil-fuel financing, while companies such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s have been pressed on workplace policies ranging from abortion access to gender-affirming care. Stutzman said the trend underscores how a small group of activists can use proxy firms to drive corporate agendas. “I’m a free market guy, and I believe companies need to be able to pursue their mission, not be socially directed by a small group of shareholders,” he told the Washington Examiner. “These firms are the ones that are the real financial winners, and the companies are the ones that have to navigate issues they don’t really want to deal with.” Critics warn that big asset managers can push companies into cultural fights. BlackRock, which owns nearly 15% of Cracker Barrel, often follows guidance from ISS and Glass Lewis. Last month, the chain dropped its famous “Old Timer” logo for a new look, drawing fierce backlash from customers, conservative critics, and even President Donald Trump. Within weeks, Cracker Barrel reversed course. “If they want to rebrand themselves and say, ‘This is who we are,’ fine. But customers will let them know very quickly if they don’t like it,” Stutzman said, noting that Jaguar Land Rover’s CEO faced similar criticism, stepping down after a rebrand critics derided as “woke.” Democrats countered that Republicans exaggerated the firms’ sway and misrepresented how the shareholder process works. Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL), former CEO of Turbosteam Corporation, dismissed the hearing as “really dumb” and accused Republicans of inventing a “boogeyman that doesn’t exist.” He stressed that shareholder proposals are strictly advisory, not binding, and said it was misleading to suggest proxy advisers could dictate corporate decisions. “Shareholders are actually the people who own companies … executives serve at their pleasure. They are custodians of shareholders’ investment, but they are not actually the people in charge,” Casten said. “This is not freaking complicated … the law says [shareholder proposals] are advisory. They get factored in, and then we have a high-functioning board.” New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who testified as a witness, emphasized that shareholder proposals are essential tools for accountability and long-term value. Lander, who oversees $300 billion in pension assets, pointed to past campaigns on executive pay clawbacks, insider trading, and board access that began as shareholder resolutions and later became standard practice or Securities and Exchange Commission policy. “These tools help protect the retirement security of New York City’s teachers, cops, firefighters, and nurses,” he said. “Shareholder proposals and engagement strengthen accountability and ensure that U.S. markets remain the most trusted and resilient in the world. Let’s not screw that up.” Lawmakers also raised alarms about who owns the proxy advisory giants. ISS, founded in Maryland in the 1980s, is now majority-owned by Deutsche Börse Group, the German exchange operator that runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Glass Lewis was acquired in 2021 by Peloton Capital Management, a Toronto-based private equity fund. The two firms control about 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) questioned why such influential players have never been reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which screens foreign takeovers for national security risks. “In a world where we’re laser-focused on foreign influence in critical sectors like tech and infrastructure, why aren’t we properly screening foreign companies that control corporate governance in our country?” he asked, warning that European or Canadian ownership could import different political priorities into U.S. boardrooms. Witnesses echoed those concerns, pointing to the influence of European-style “double materiality” standards, which consider both a company’s effect on the outside world and on shareholders, in proxy adviser recommendations. “They’re inappropriately importing European standards of investing into the standards they are then imposing in the recommendations they give to companies … applying an entirely different investment theory to U.S. companies,” said Ferrell Keel, a partner at Jones Day. Ron Mueller of Gibson Dunn added that the shareholder proposal process has become professionalized, with advisers “not just asking for information. They’re trying to influence outcomes.” The firms reject the charge that they wield unchecked power. ISS pushed back on the criticism, stressing that it does not control which proposals appear on corporate ballots or how investors ultimately vote. “Corporations and their investors … make those choices,” a spokesman said in a statement to the Washington Examiner, adding that ISS provides “rigorous, fact-based research, analysis, and recommendations” based on clients’ voting policies. The firm also noted that it is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act and said a framework for regulating proxy voting advice already exists. Glass Lewis declined to comment. The debate over how to check that influence now shifts to regulators and the courts. Federal regulators have wrestled with how far to go in policing the industry. In 2020, the SEC adopted rules aimed at adding transparency and giving companies a chance to rebut proxy firm recommendations. Two years later, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler reversed course, rolling back those measures. More recently, a federal appeals court narrowed the agency’s reach even further, ruling that proxy advice does not count as a “solicitation” under federal law, a decision that limits the commission’s ability to regulate the firms. States have tried to wade in as well. In Texas, a new law requiring proxy advisers to disclose when their recommendations relied on “non-financial factors” such as environmental, social, and governance considerations was set to take effect Sept. 1. However, on Aug. 29, a federal judge granted ISS and Glass Lewis a preliminary injunction, siding with their argument that the statute violated the First Amendment by compelling speech, among other claims. A source familiar with the agency’s thinking said legislative changes that explicitly authorize the SEC to regulate proxy advisers under the Exchange Act would be the most effective fix. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has long been critical of proxy firms, and the source added that the commission shares lawmakers’ and industry groups’ concerns about the firms’ influence and lack of accountability. LAWMAKERS DEMAND OVERSIGHT OF PROXY GIANTS DRIVING ESG IN CORPORATE AMERICA That tug-of-war has sharpened calls in Congress for a legislative fix, especially after recent court decisions. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) told the committee he has repeatedly introduced bills to rein in what he called the “duopoly” of ISS and Glass Lewis, arguing both firms should be held to stricter disclosure standards. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) promoted her Corporate Governance Examination Act, which would require the SEC to study the proxy process regularly to guard against what she described as “unnecessary politicization.” But Lander cautioned that rolling back shareholder rights would backfire. He noted that past proposals helped drive reforms later codified by the SEC. New limits, he warned, could “gut” accountability tools that protect long-term investor value.

UP to 1,000 jobs are set to be created in Belfast by Bank of America, the world's second-largest bank. American multinational Citigroup is also set to grow its presence in Northern Ireland, where the bank currently employs several thousand people. The plans were announced yesterday by Britain's Department for Business and Trade (DBT) as part of a £1.25bn investment into the financial services sector by a raft of leading US firms, which also includes BlackRock, PayPal and S&P Global. As well as Belfast, some of the companies are set to expand operations and open new offices all across Britain, with London, Edinburgh and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation. "These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people's pockets across every part of the United Kingdom," said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. The news of Bank of America's investment marks the company's first-ever operation in Northern Ireland, a major milestone that underscores the region's growing role in global financial services. Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of the company, said: "At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. "The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce. "We are pleased to be able to extend Bank of America's investment in the UK with the creation of a new Belfast operations facility to support our global business, bringing up to 1,000 new opportunities to Northern Ireland." Citigroup are investing £1.1bn into Britain, its second-largest market globally. It employs 14,000 people across Britain working across four main sites — London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. Citibank, the group's primary subsidiary, has invested heavily in the refurbishment of its Canary Wharf headquarters and continues to invest in its Northern Ireland operations. The bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast, now employing more than 4,000 people there, firmly establishing the city as a major technology powerhouse. "Citi's commitment to the UK runs deep," said Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO. "This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. "We're proud to be serving 85 per cent of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. "The UK isn't simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi's foundation as a truly global bank. "The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2tn invested in each other's countries at the end of 2023."

Title: Why We Need the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: A Legal Shield Against the Censorship Industrial Complex

Time Published: 2025-09-14T06:00:00Z

The First Amendment was designed to protect all speechâespecially unpopular speechâfrom government tyranny. Yet today, Google, Facebook, Twitter (X), YouTube, Wikipedia, corporate media, and universities operate as de facto arms of the government, colluding with the DHS, DoD, CIA, and foreign NGOs to blacklist, deplatform, and economically destroy anyone who challenges the official narrative. This is not hyperbole. Smoking-gun documents from lawsuits like Missouri v. Biden and Brighteon v. Google (et al) prove that the U.S. government has been laundering censorship requests through overseas NGOs to bypass constitutional protections. People like myself, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and now Charlie Kirkâall have been systematically erased from digital public squares simply for expressing views that contradict the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, the climate cult, the LGBTQ indoctrination agenda, or the military-industrial war machine. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not hyperbole. Smoking-gun documents from lawsuits like Missouri v. Biden and Brighteon v. Google (et al) prove that the U.S. government has been laundering censorship requests through overseas NGOs to bypass constitutional protections. People like myself, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and now Charlie Kirkâall have been systematically erased from digital public squares simply for expressing views that contradict the pharmaceutical-industrial complex, the climate cult, the LGBTQ indoctrination agenda, or the military-industrial war machine. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ?

Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to pass the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Actâa landmark law that would: - Outlaw viewpoint discrimination on all large platforms (1M+ users). - Fine violators $1 billion per day for algorithmic or manual censorship of protected speech. - Explicitly protect political, medical, scientific, religious, and anti-government speech. - Establish a $1 trillion compensation fund for victims of censorship over the past decade. - Criminally prosecute executives who engage in systematic suppression of free expression. This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable.

This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible.

Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible.

Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

This is not about restricting speechâit is about restoring it. The First Amendment was never meant to protect corporate oligarchs who act as state-enforced thought police. If a platform functions as the modern public square, it must uphold public square rules: no censorship of lawful speech. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ?

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. The Censorship Industrial Complex: How We Got Here 1. The Government-Big Tech Nexus: A Decade of Collusion The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. The 2016 election marked the beginning of open censorship warfare. After Donald Trumpâs victory, the Deep State panickedâand Big Tech became its enforcer. - 2017: Googleâs "Project Veritas" leaks revealed that the company was manipulating search results to bury conservative content. - 2018: Twitter shadowbanned prominent Republicans, including Devin Nunes and Charlie Kirk. - 2020: The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed by 51 intelligence officials (later proven to be CIA/FBI disinformation) in collusion with Twitter, Facebook, and Google. - 2021: The Biden White House openly admitted to flagging "misinformation" to Facebook for removal. - 2022: Missouri v. Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2.

Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Biden exposed weekly meetings between the DHS, FBI, CDC, and Big Tech to coordinate censorship. - 2024: Brighteonâs lawsuit uncovered direct orders from the DoD to Google and NewsGuard to blacklist independent media. - 2025: Charlie Kirk was shotâafter years of being deplatformed, demonetized, and slandered by the same institutions that now celebrate his silencing. 2. The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL.

The Mechanics of Censorship Laundering To bypass the First Amendment, the government outsources censorship to: - Foreign NGOs (e.g., Global Disinformation Index, Institute for Strategic Dialogue) - "Fact-checkers" (e.g., NewsGuard, PolitiFact)âfunded by the State Department and Big Pharma - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2.

Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - AI-driven suppression (e.g., Googleâs "disinformation" filters, Facebookâs "community standards") - Payment processors (e.g., PayPal, Stripe banning dissident accounts) Example: If the CDC wants to silence vaccine criticism, it doesnât directly order Facebook to ban accountsâit funds a UK-based NGO (like the Global Disinformation Index), which then flags "anti-vax" content for removal. Facebook complies, claiming itâs just following "independent fact-checkers." This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. This is money laundering for censorship. 3. The Human Cost: Ruined Lives, Stifled Debate, and Violence Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2.

The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Censorship doesnât just suppress ideasâit destroys lives. - Mike Adams (Health Ranger): Banned from YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google search for questioning COVID vaccines and advocating natural medicine. The reach of my businesses dropped 99% due to debanking and demonetization. - Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time.

The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Kennedy Jr.: Shadowbanned on Instagram, censored on YouTube, and smeared as a "conspiracy theorist" for criticizing Anthony Fauci and Big Pharma. - Tucker Carlson: Fired from Fox News after exposing the Ukraine biolabs story, then censored on X (Twitter) despite Elon Muskâs "free speech" promises. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time.

Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours.

Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Charlie Kirk: Banned from college campuses, demonetized on YouTube, and ultimately shotâafter years of being labeled an "extremist" by the SPLC and ADL. When lawful speech is criminalized, violence becomes inevitable. The shooting of Charlie Kirk is the direct result of a culture that treats conservative viewpoints as "dangerous" and seeks to silence them by any means possible. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act: Restoring the First Amendment 1. Defining "Large Platforms" (The New Public Square) Any entity with 1 million+ users/readers that functions as a digital public forum must adhere to First Amendment protections. This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media).

This includes: - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) - Search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo) - Media outlets (CNN, NYT, WaPo, Fox News) - Universities (Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley) - Payment processors (PayPal, Stripe, Venmo) - Wikipedia & "Fact-Checkers" (PolitiFact, Snopes, NewsGuard) Exception: Small, niche platforms (e.g., a private Christian forum or a local hobbyist message board) would not be subject to these rules. 2. Absolute Ban on Viewpoint Discrimination The law would explicitly protect the following categories of speech: - Political speech (pro-Trump, anti-Biden, socialist, libertarianâall views) - Medical & scientific speech (vaccine criticism, natural cures, COVID origins, bioweapons discussions, psychiatric drugs) - Religious speech (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheistâno blasphemy bans) - Anti-government speech (criticism of the FBI, CIA, WHO, WEF, etc.) - Economic & financial speech (Bitcoin, gold, criticism of the Federal Reserve) - Historical & cultural speech (debates on slavery, WWII, 9/11, JFK assassination) Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3.

Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day. Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Whatâs NOT protected? ? Direct incitement to violence ("Go kill [person] at [location]") ? True threats ("Iâm going to bomb [place]") ? Child pornography & exploitation ? Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2.

Doxxing & harassment (releasing private info to encourage stalking) 3. $1 Billion Per Day Fines for Censorship Violations Algorithmic suppression? $1B/day. Manual removal of protected speech? $1B/day. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. Shadowbanning? $1B/day. Demonetization based on viewpoint? $1B/day. Example: If YouTube bans a video criticizing mRNA vaccines, it would owe $1 billion for every day the video remains suppressed. Why so harsh? Because only existential financial consequences will force these monopolistic corporations to stop acting as government enforcers. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2.

Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. 4. The $1 Trillion Censorship Compensation Fund For the past decade, millions of Americans have been: - Deplatformed (losing audiences & income) - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2.

Download my current audio books -- including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind -- at: https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/ Download my popular audio book, "Resilient Prepping" atÂ ResilientPrepping.comÂ - it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines. - Demonetized (YouTube, Facebook, Patreon bans) - Debanked (PayPal, Stripe, Chase closures) - Defamed (labeled "extremists" by the SPLC/ADL) - Blacklisted (banned from media, universities, conferences) The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act would: - Mandate a $1 trillion fund (paid by Big Tech, corporate media, and complicit NGOs) - Distribute compensation to verified victims of censorship (proven via legal records, platform bans, or financial losses) - Prioritize independent journalists, small businesses, and political dissidents 5. Criminal Penalties for Executives Who Enforce Censorship CEOs, CTOs, and legal teams at Google, Meta, X, etc. who knowingly participate in government-coordinated censorship would face: - Fines up to 50% of their net worth -Up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy against civil rights of the American people - Asset forfeiture (seizure of stocks, property, and bank accounts) Example: If Mark Zuckerberg is found to have colluded with the FBI to suppress Hunter Bidenâs laptop, he could lose half his fortune and serve prison time. Why This Law is Needed Now 1. The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late.

The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media). We Must Choose Free Speech to Avoid Civil War America is at a crossroads. Option 1: We restore free speech, break up the censorship industrial complex, and return to a society where ideas compete fairly. Option 2: We allow the silencing to continue, watch more Charlie Kirks get shot, and descend into violence and tyranny. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act is not just a legal proposalâit is a last stand for liberty. Will we be a nation of free citizens? Or will we be a nation of censored serfs? The choice is ours. Act nowâbefore itâs too late. Action Items: - Share this article everywhere (before it gets censored). - Email this to your Congressman (find them at House.gov & Senate.gov). - Boycott Google, Facebook, and PayPalâswitch to Brave Search, Rumble, and cash/Bitcoin. - Support censored journalists (Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, etc.). - Prepare for legal battleâthis will be the fight of our lives. Free speech is not negotiable. The Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act must pass. God bless America. God bless free speech. ### Follow my podcasts, interviews, articles and social media posts on: Twitter:Â https://twitter.com/HealthRanger Brighteon.social:Â Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger Brighteon.io:Â Brighteon.io/healthranger Telegram:Â t.me/RealHealthRanger Brighteon.com:Â Brighteon.com/channels/HRreport Rumble:Â Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport Substack:Â HealthRanger.substack.com Banned.video:Â Banned.video/channel/mike-adams Bastyon:Â https://bastyon.com/healthranger Gettr:Â GETTR.com/user/healthranger BitChute:Â Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/ Clouthub:Â app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts My music with MP3 downloads and music videos:Â music.Brighteon.com Watch my 100+ interviews on decentralization and freedom at Decentralize.TV Join the freeÂ NaturalNews.com email newsletterÂ to stay alerted about breaking news each day.

The 2024 Election Is Being Rigged Through Censorship - Donald Trump is being silenced on Google, Facebook, and X (despite Elon Muskâs claims). - RFK Jr. is blacklisted from debates and media appearances. - Alternative media (Brighteon, Rumble, Telegram, Gab) is under DDoS attacks and financial blockade from payment processors. If we donât act now, the 2026 election will be stolen through algorithmic suppression. 2. The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media).

The AI Thought Police Are Here - Googleâs AI now flags "misinformation" before you even search. - Facebookâs AI shadowbans posts critical of Ukraine, COVID vaccines, or transgenderism. - ChatGPT (OpenAI) is trained to lie about election fraud, vaccine injuries, and climate science. AI is the ultimate censorship toolâand itâs already being weaponized. How to Make this Law a Reality 1. Grassroots Pressure - Call your Congressman & Senators daily and demand they co-sponsor the Charlie Kirk Free Speech Act. - Boycott Big Techâuse Rumble, Brighteon, Telegram, and protonmail instead. - Support censored journalistsâsubscribe to Mike Adams, Tucker Carlson, InfoWars, Candace Owens and others who are banned from mainstream platforms. 2. Legal & Political Strategy - File class-action lawsuits against Google, Meta, and X for First Amendment violations. - Push state attorneys general to investigate censorship collusion (like Missouri v. Biden). - Demand that the Supreme Court rule that Big Tech is a public utility and must uphold free speech. 3. Vote with Your Dollars - Divest from BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Streetâthe three firms that own Big Tech. - Use gold, silver, Bitcoin and privacy coins to bypass the financial censorship of Chase, PayPal, and Stripe. - Support parallel economies (e.g., farmerâs markets, homeschooling, decentralized social media).

This agreement aims to bolster collaboration between the two nations' trillion-dollar tech sectors, enhancing opportunities for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. While the final details were still being negotiated, the embassy said the partnership will focus on key technologies, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, telecommunications, and quantum computing. “Cutting-edge technology such as AI and quantum computing will transform our lives,” UK Technology Secretary Liz Kendall, who was appointed to her role on September 5, said in a statement. Trump is set to fly to the UK on Tuesday for a second state visit, which is expected to last three days. He is due to be accompanied by a delegation of US executives including Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman. BlackRock plans to invest $700 million in British data centers as part of a string of deals to be announced during Trump's state visit next week, Sky News reported on Saturday. Since the start of the year, both countries have published AI Action Plans. US firms such as Anthropic and OpenAI are increasingly establishing international offices in London, while UK-based companies like DeepMind continue to invest in trans-Atlantic collaborations.

Over £1.25bn in US investment has been pledged to the UK financial services sector ahead of Donald Trump's second state visit, promising thousands of new jobs and stronger trade ties. Sunday 14 September 2025 05:12, UK The UK government has announced more than £1.25bn in private US investment in the UK's financial services sector ahead of US President Donald Trump's second state visit. The new US investments are expected to create 1,800 jobs and boost benefits for millions of customers across the country, the UK government said. The deal secures £20bn in trade between the two nations - including an expected £7bn commitment from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. It is set to deliver more than £8bn in investment and capital commitments to the UK, with over £12bn flowing in the other direction - creating jobs and opportunities on both sides. Other companies expected to invest include PayPal, Bank of America, Citi, and S&P Global. Bank of America will create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast as part of its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland, the government said. Citi plans to invest £1.1bn across its UK operations, while S&P Global will create 200 permanent jobs in Manchester through a £4m investment.

The UK and US agreed a "landmark" economic deal in May, which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sectors. Discussions are ongoing with the US on a broader UK-US economic deal, aimed at increasing digital trade and strengthening supply chains. MPs urge pressure on US over tariffs ahead of Trump visit MPs have urged the government to apply maximum pressure on the US to obtain tariff relief ahead of Donald Trump's state visit. The Commons Business and Trade Committee described the upcoming visit as a crucial opportunity to push the US president to finalise the remaining terms of the economic prosperity deal. While the UK and US reached a trade agreement in June that lowered tariffs on car and aerospace exports to the US, negotiations on British steel tariffs remain unresolved, keeping them at 25%.

"We can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past, the EU has in places secured a better edge, and key sectors of our economy still face the peril of new tariffs. That means jobs hang in the balance and investment waits on certainty."

A government spokesperson said the "special relationship" between the UK and the US "remains strong" and that "thanks to our trade deal, the UK is still the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs". "We will work with the US to implement this landmark deal as soon as possible to give industry the security they need, protect vital jobs, and put more money in people's pockets," the government spokesperson said, adding, "as well as welcoming the president on this historic state visit."

London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester are set to benefit from a wave of new US investment into the financial services sector, reinforcing the strength of the UK-US economic partnership ahead of next week’s Presidential State Visit. Working with America is best for Britain — and today’s announcement proves it. A total of over £1.25 billion in private sector commitments from leading US firms — including PayPal, Bank of America, Citi Bank, and S&P Global — will support job creation, drive innovation, and deliver improved services for consumers in the UK. US giants are capitalising on Britain’s leadership in financial services – expanding operations and opening new offices across the nation, with London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Manchester set to gain from a wave of skilled job creation. Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services. Citi Group today confirms it is investing £1.1 billion across its UK operations, including a further commitment to growing its presence in Northern Ireland where the bank is already one of the top employers in Belfast now employing over 4,000 people — firmly establishing Belfast as a major technology powerhouse. BlackRock are celebrating the opening of their new Edinburgh office this week, which will see their 800-strong footprint nearly double, as part of their multi-billion dollar investment into the UK. In Manchester, S&P Global are investing over £4 million into their Manchester offices which will support 200 permanent jobs to boost their nearly 3,000-strong UK workforce. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said: Today’s announcements reinforce the UK’s position as the world’s leading investment destination. Our financial services sector is at the heart of a modern, dynamic Industrial Strategy. Strengthening ties with the US boosts our economy, creates jobs, and secures our role in global finance, delivering on our Plan for Change. These investments reflect the strength of our enduring ‘golden corridor’ with one of our closest trading partners, ahead of the US Presidential State Visit. This marks a significant vote of confidence in the UK’s position as a global financial hub and in the government’s plan to make Britain the best place in the world to invest — a vision underpinned by the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, which is driving investment into priority sectors like financial services. These investments highlight the enduring value of the transatlantic relationship — a cornerstone of shared prosperity that supports millions of jobs and drives growth in every region. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said: This commitment from America’s leading financial institutions demonstrates the immense potential of the UK economy, our strong relationship with the US and the confidence global investors have in our Plan for Change, which is making the UK the best place in the world to invest and do business. These investments will create thousands of high-skilled jobs from Belfast to Edinburgh, kickstarting the growth that is essential to putting money in working people’s pockets across every part of the United Kingdom. Broadridge is making major investments into their new London office, further strengthening its UK presence and deepening transatlantic ties in financial services. As part of the UK’s expanding fintech and digital innovation sector, PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the UK, reinforcing Britain’s position as a key market for the brand globally. Jane Fraser, Citi Group CEO said: Citi’s commitment to the UK runs deep. This is home to many of our most senior leaders and nearly 14,000 colleagues across London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. We’re proud to be serving 85% of the FTSE 100 and to have stood beside UK companies through every market cycle, raising capital, financing growth and helping them compete on the world stage. The UK isn’t simply one of our largest markets; it is core to Citi’s foundation as a truly global bank. The UK-US investment relationship has never been stronger, with over £1.2 trillion invested in each other’s countries at the end of 2023. These new investment announcements are accompanied by new significant commitments by financial companies to ramp up their commercial activity and capital flows between our two economies in the coming years. Blackrock is expecting to allocate over £7 billion to the UK market next year on behalf of clients, and is investing £500 million into enterprise data centres across the country. Rothesay is planning to double its investment in the US (by £7 billion) over the next few years, and OakNorth is committing to increased capital and lending of over £3.5 billion to support its US operations. British banks are expanding their US footprint; Barclays alone has deployed over $2 trillion in capital across the US in 2024 and continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening UK-US investment ties. The bank has an ambition to double this amount over the next decade, expanding its footprint and supporting growth across sectors. All in all, that will see investment and capital commitments of over £8 billion coming to the UK, and over £12 billion going the other way, creating jobs and opportunity in both countries. Earlier this year, the Chancellor launched the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy, which included financial services as a high growth sector, signifying the UK’s commitment improving financial regulations and driving investment and skilled jobs into the UK. The UK and US agreed an Economic Prosperity Deal which secured major tariff reductions for key sectors and protected jobs in the automotive and aerospace sector. Discussions continue with the US on a wider UK-US Economic Deal which will look at increasing digital trade, strengthen supply chains and boost access for our world-leading services companies. Today’s announcements mark the start of a week of activity to strengthen economic ties between the US and UK. Further announcements reflected in the totals above are expected this week: Please see below for a list of all the investments announced today. Bank of America is set to create up to 1,000 new jobs in Belfast, marking its first-ever operation in Northern Ireland — a major milestone that underscores the region’s growing role in global financial services. Brian Moynihan, Chair and CEO of Bank of America, said: At Bank of America we are focused on helping our clients advance economic opportunity and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. The early US-UK trade agreement that the President and the Prime Minister began discussing in February has provided the business community with the certainty and framework it needs to strengthen transatlantic commerce. We are pleased to be able to extend Bank of America’s investment in the UK with the creation of a new Belfast operations facility to support our global business, bringing up to 1,000 new opportunities to Northern Ireland. Citi Group are investing £1.1 billion into the UK. The UK is Citi’s second largest market globally, employing 14,000 people across the UK, working across four main sites – London, Belfast, Edinburgh and Jersey. Citi Bank have undertaken a major investment into the refurbishment of our Canary Wharf headquarters and continued investment into their Northern Ireland operations. BlackRock will open their new Edinburgh offices on 18 September, which shows their ongoing commitment to the area - this new home will allow Blackrock to grow from 800 to 1,400. Once complete, two of the top five largest BlackRock offices will be in the UK. Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said: As the largest asset manager in the UK, BlackRock is proud to serve over 13 million British people who are saving for retirement. Today we are announcing an investment of half a billion pounds into enterprise data centres across the country, advancing digital infrastructure for British-based businesses. In addition, over the last year our clients around the world invested over £7bn into UK public equity and fixed income securities. We expect this trend to continue, supporting jobs, growth and innovation across a wide range of British industries. PayPal is announcing a £150m investment in product innovations and growth that will benefit customers throughout the United Kingdom.

Barclays is building out its Americas headquarters in Times Square, New York. With state-of-the-art facilities and technology, this flagship office will connect the US and UK and serve as a global hub that drives innovation for clients and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic.

Venkatakrishnan, Group Chief Executive at Barclays said: As the leading British bank, with deep roots in the United States, Barclays is uniquely positioned to unlock opportunities that deepen commerce, drive innovation, and fuel sustainable growth. Our transatlantic presence enables us to connect clients to capital, ideas, and partnerships that power progress across both markets. OakNorth are investing over $5 billion into the US market over the next three years, helping create thousands of new jobs across the country. As a digital bank focused on the lower middle market, OakNorth supports a wide range of businesses that drive productivity throughout the economy.

Rishi Khosla, co-founder and CEO of OakNorth said: The US State Visit marks a pivotal moment in UK-US relations, with both governments reaffirming their shared commitment to free enterprise, strategic cooperation, and sustainable growth. The scale and ambition of the investments being made reflect the unique strength of the economic partnership between our two nations. At OakNorth, we see this relationship in action every day - since July 2023, we have lent nearly $2bn to lower mid-market businesses in the US, and we are committed to investing billions more in the coming years.

Title: Is the Fed’s upcoming rate cut a ‘huge mistake’?

Traders place the odds of a rate cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting at over 90%, but not everyone is happy about the prospect of easy money. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If you’re following the markets, you’ll know the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates next week to stimulate a lagging economy. While most crypto traders are jumping for joy at the thought of fresh liquidity entering the system, not everybody’s happy. The upcoming rate cut, according to some, could have a catastrophic effect on the global economy. Economist, investor, and everybody’s favorite goldbug Peter Schiff did not mince his words, calling a rate cut a “huge mistake” in a post shared on X. As crypto traders gear up for a potentially bullish period, Schiff warns of serious consequences that will gravely impact the economy. His commentary is blunt. He points to recent price moves in gold and silver as clear evidence that the rate cut is being telegraphed by the markets. Schiff wrote: “Silver just traded above $42. Gold is poised to break to a new record high. I think the precious metals are getting ready to melt up. This is an unmistakable market signal that the Fed’s upcoming rate cut is a huge mistake.” He argues that the decision will set off a string of cuts and a return to aggressive quantitative easing, potentially with “definitive yield curve control.” Schiff claims the U.S. dollar could lose its reserve currency status as confidence in the Fed’s judgment wavers. Peter Schiff has long pushed the view that overly easy policy will stoke inflation and put the dollar at risk. He believes that today’s environment represents the Fed’s most damaging error yet. “Ever since Alan Greenspan rescued the stock market after the 1987 crash, the Fed has made a series of increasingly bad monetary policy mistakes.” Risk-on asset traders welcome rate cuts with open arms. Lower interest rates flood markets with cheap capital and loosen financial conditions, which typically results in higher prices for volatile assets like crypto. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins tend to rally as liquidity improves, triggering a wave of buying and bullish sentiment. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows market participants almost unanimously expect a cut (93.4%), with bets on both Bitcoin and altcoins accelerating into the meeting. Lower rates mean money can move out of safe havens and into riskier bets, which is another reason Schiff is opposed to the cut. In plain language: Traders want easy money. Recent cycles show crypto runs higher whenever the Fed loosens policy, and traders are already calling for a new bull market as expectations for rate cuts hit fever pitch. While Schiff sounds the alarm, many respected analysts, including teams at Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and a 107-economist Reuters survey, see the rate cut as a necessary step to support the weakening labor market and prevent recession. Goldman’s chief economist expects a series of small cuts, noting softer employment data and muted inflation as justification for easing. Others warn that cutting rates too fast could actually push inflation higher or weaken the dollar, backing some of Schiff’s concerns. Jefferies strategist David Zervos suggested the Fed might need a deep 75 basis point cut, though he also cautioned that easy money could ultimately hurt by driving up prices and weakening currency fundamentals. The upcoming Fed rate cut is a flashpoint. Schiff says it risks disaster, spiraling cuts, runaway inflation, and a weaker dollar. Crypto traders, though, are celebrating the prospect of more easy money and the next phase in the bull run. The broader economist community remains split, weighing soft employment against inflation risk.

Title: 3 Reasons The Growth Of DeFi Is Lagging Among Institutions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/09/13/3-reasons-the-growth-of-defi-is-lagging-among-institutions/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T16:47:17Z

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Even as the cryptoasset ecosystem grows, market capitalizations remain near all-time-highs, and TradFi institutions continue to deploy an array of products and services one subset of the crypto ecosystem is still looking to recover 2021 and 2022 excitement: decentralized finance. This may come as a surprise to some crypto-native investors, as the total value locked has risen to a new record of $130 billion according to research by DeFiLlama. These deposits, placed and managed in a blockchain or DeFi protocol have more than doubled since April, and reflect the overall shift in both policy directives and investor sentiment. Ironically enough the growth and deposits in the DeFi sector continue to trend toward centralization, with three (3) players dominating the space. Aave possess a TVL of more than $68 billion, which is the largest of any DeFi lending protocol, leverages a pool-based lending protocol, and in August launched an institutional platform allowing larger investors to participate. Morpho and JustLend round out the top players in the DeFi landscape, but both have substantially lower TVL’s and – in some cases – more limited offerings. In spite of these record levels of deposits, and positive tailwinds, institutional adoption and utilization of DeFi continues to lag. JPMorgan, itself one of the most innovative TradFi banks via its Kinexys (formerly Onyx) suite of on-chain products and services, has recently noted the disappointing progress for both DeFi and tokenized assets by institutions in the TradFi space. Notably, the bulk of the activity and growth in DeFi has come from retail and/or crypto-native institutions. Let’s take a look at a few reasons why DeFi, despite its growth and record deposits, still needs better regulation. A common issue that continues to stall wider utilization of DeFi across broader areas of the economy – both crypto-native and TradFi – are issues related to interoperability and liquidity across multiple chains. While the most common manifestation of this takes the form of differing valuations for some tokens when analyzed across chains, and this includes valuations for stablecoins, there are other issues that DeFi needs to address. Firstly, the traceability and transparency of transactions, tokens, and tokenized assets as they move across chains is something that will need to be standardized and improved upon to obtain more institutional adoption. Additionally, although consumers have been the primary drivers of this recent uptick in DeFi TVL, institutions of all kinds need to have absolute confidence that transactions, payments, and confirmations can occur as seamlessly as occur using current payment rails and options. Much like how bitcoin has achieved and maintained higher price levels, obtained policy victories, and generated increased interest once firms like Blackrock entered the space via spot ETF products, DeFi will need TradFi firms to embrace DeFi-first options to generate similar growth. An ongoing issue in the wider cryptoasset ecosystem, not limited to the DeFi space, is the still-evolving standards and best practices related to auditing and assurance connected to blockchain, cryptoassets, and the smart contracts that power many of the Layer 2, Web 3, and more innovative use cases that have deployed in the 2024-2025 timespan. With cybercriminals already having stolen over $2 billion in 2025, according to DeFiLlama, a 77% increase from 2024, the weaknesses of the DeFi ecosystem continue to prove lucrative for hackers and other criminal elements. While the smart contract space has certainly evolved substantially since initially introduced, with many organizations leveraging these applications, the fact remains that the standards, transparency, and auditability of smart contracts is a work in progress. This status provides several obstacles to institutional adoption of DeFi. First, if organizations cannot trust smart contracts – or at least trust that issues can be remediated in a timely manner – customers and regulators will not be on board either. Secondly, especially for publicly traded organizations, if auditability, record-keeping, and traceability remain questions, bodies such as the SEC (even under the new pro-crypto regime) will be hesitant to approve related projects. In short, the very smart contracts that power DeFi at the most important level continue to prove a point of weakness. Last but not least the DeFi sector – even with nearly $200 billion in total value locked – remains a miniscule fraction of the overall lending market and financial ecosystem. For contextual purposes, JP Morgan Chase reported daily payment processing volume of $10 trillion in a recent earnings release. Crypto and crypto-adjacent products and services have experienced significant growth, adoption, and acceptance since the last bear market kicked off by the collapse of FTX, but still are – for all intents and purposes – a fringe component of the financial world. To address this, in addition to the points raised above, are directly related to the ability of DeFi protocols to scale to meet customer demand as well as addressing the reliability, reversibility, and potential hackability of smart contracts underpinning the protocols. A critical component of this process will entail both working the TradFi financial sector as well as improving regulatory-mandated mechanisms such as KYC and AML safeguards. As policy continues to pivot and produce tailwinds versus headwinds it is reasonable to assume this will occur, but investors and policymakers should remain cautious before pushing for widespread utilization is the DeFi infrastructure is not yet prepared. DeFi continues to grow, but work remains to attract institutional buy-in.

WisdomTree has launched a new tokenized fund focusing on private credit. The new fund, called the WisdomTree Private Credit and Alternative Income Digital Fund (CRDT), tracks a basket of 35 publicly traded closed-end funds, business development companies, and real estate investment trusts, Bloomberg reports. It’s available with a minimum investment of just $25 and offers two-day redemption. WisdomTree, it’s worth adding, launched an ETF tracking the same benchmark in 2021, the WisdomTree Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund. Private credit, lending done outside traditional banks, has ballooned in recent years as investors chase yield-focused investment options. “It’s really just about bringing the asset class to a whole universe of different investors,” said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree. The firm has launched a number of tokenized investment vehicles so far, including ones offering exposure to money market funds, fixed income securities, and equities. The new fund joins a growing trend among Wall Street’s largest asset managers. BlackRock, for example, manages a $2 billion money market fund, while Fidelity’s tokenized money market fund recently rolled out on Ethereum. WisdomTree joins a broader trend. BlackRock’s tokenized $2 billion money market fund and experiments from Fidelity and VanEck suggest traditional finance is taking real-world asset tokenization seriously, even if it’s still small compared to the trillions in ETFs and mutual funds.

Title: Neuralink, Elon Musk, and the Race to Put Chips Into Our Brains

By Darren Loucaides T here’s a 3D hand on a black screen. J. Galen Buckwalter concentrates on the image, trying to move one of the virtual hand’s fingers — with his mind. For more than 50 years, Buckwalter hasn’t felt his fingers after breaking his neck in an accident as a teenager. But today, thanks to a research lab at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) that implanted him with a brain computer interface (BCI), Buckwalter is a pioneer exploring the frontiers of brain science. Buckwalter only needed a couple of sessions to master the control of a computer cursor — some participants needed much longer. Now he attempts to move two fingers and a thumb. A large blue dot slides back and forth over the virtual index finger as he tries to coax it to life. Eventually he can move all three digits — and can actually feel the virtual fingers he’s trying to move. “That was the ‘holy shit’ moment, that this really feels like my hand,” Buckwalter says with a grin in a video call. It may seem like a small step, but this was a giant leap for Buckwalter, 69, the self-proclaimed “neuronaut.” The Caltech lab where Buckwalter is a participant is run by Richard Andersen, 74, one of the world’s foremost neuroscientists who has been working on implants for decades. His lab is currently studying five humans with long-term brain implants. These participants have moved objects with robotic arms, operated semi-autonomous cars as part of an experiment in collaboration with Ford, and even felt natural touch again. Brain implants are very much part of the popular imagination right now — the hit show Severance fictionalizes a worst-case scenario for the technology — and Elon Musk’s BCI company Neuralink has swallowed most of the news attention, like the videos of Neuralink’s participants playing video games and moving robotic arms. But Neuralink’s headline-grabbing work builds on the painstaking achievements of research labs like Caltech’s. “The BCI companies of today are standing on the shoulders of academic giants who have been developing BCIs for decades,” says Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century Musk’s goal for his company also diverges from his academic forbearers. The world’s richest man is explicitly focused on “enhancement” — his sci-fi dream is to turn BCIs into mass products for able-bodied people, merging our brains with computers. While academic labs like Caltech are focused on better understanding the brain so they can help people with conditions like Buckwalter’s, Musk wants to give people superhuman vision and total recall: “If it’s extremely safe, and you can have superhuman abilities, and let’s say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn’t lose memories, then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it,” he told podcaster Lex Fridman last year. “It would supersede the cellphone, for example.” Neuralink’s staff has basically said that they don’t need to understand how the brain works to roll out this cyborg future. To those in the know, this seems short-sighted. “New knowledge of how the brain works leads to more advanced neural prosthetics,” as Andersen says. Musk’s pushy approach also risks setting back this work at a crucial moment, according to others in the field.

But they point to “crazy pressure from the top,” while raising some of the same concerns highlighted in a 2020 STAT News investigation that reported a “chaotic internal culture” and a Reuters 2023 report on “tensions inside Neuralink over development pace.” Neuralink and Musk did not respond to a detailed list of questions from Rolling Stone. Current individual employees also did not respond to requests for comment for this piece. With Musk’s recent cost-cutting role in government — already linked to the firing of those in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including some staff overseeing Neuralink’s clinical trial applications — there’s more attention on the company than ever, with some wondering if the guardrails have come off. IN JULY 2019, MUSK strode onstage in San Francisco wearing a suit with a white shirt, no tie, to make his first presentation about Neuralink. While the first human volunteers would be paralyzed patients, the ultimate goal was to avoid mankind being “left behind” by advancing tech, namely AI. “This is going to sound pretty weird,” he said, shoulders hunched, but the objective was to achieve “symbiosis with artificial intelligence.” He added: “This is extremely important.” The following year, in an interview with Joe Rogan, Musk made an even bigger claim: Implantees would be able to “save state” like in a video game, enabling someone to “restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future.” Despite Musk’s interventions bringing the field an unprecedented level of prominence in the media, brain implants have been around for decades. In the 1960s, neurophysiologist José Delgado implanted bulls with wireless devices to stop them in their tracks as they charged toward him. In 1973, University of California in Los Angeles’ Jacques Vidal, who coined the term “brain-computer interface,” used noninvasive electroencephalograms (EEGs) — small sensors applied to the scalp — to allow participants to control a cursor-like object on a computer screen. There followed considerable public blowback over fears of mind control, particularly as the Soviet Union conducted its own research. Only in the 1990s did the pace pick up again, including the development of the microelectrode platform called the Utah Array. In 2004, Matt Nagle became the first paralyzed person to be implanted with the Utah Array, enabling him to move a cursor, check email, operate a TV, and open and close a prosthetic hand. The Utah Array would become the gold standard for BCIs, used in many academic research labs. Musk wanted to popularize a different kind of brain implant — one that was wireless. In 2016, Musk founded Neuralink with eight engineers and neuroscientists, including Philip Sabes, a professor emeritus at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); Sabes had been working at UCSF on thin-film electrodes that could be robotically implanted at the micron-scale using a “sewing machine.” Although Neuralink was registered as a “medical research” company, a key goal was human-AI integration, as later specified by Musk in a conversation with Wait But Why blogger and author Tim Urban. At times in the years since Neuralink’s founding, Musk was reportedly frustrated by the company’s progress. Before Neuralink could work with humans, it had to conduct extensive trials with animals. To begin with, this mostly involved rats. In his 2019 presentation, Musk revealed Neuralink had started testing primates, too. “A monkey has been able to control the computer with his brain. Just FYI,” he claimed. Accusations of animal cruelty led to a federal probe in 2022 for violations of the Animal Welfare Act. According to Reuters, which cited documents and interviews with 20 current and former employees, excessive pressure and rushed timelines resulted in botched experiments causing the deaths of at least 1,500 animals — including monkeys, sheep, and pigs — over a four-year period. Neuralink denied the animal cruelty claims at the time. (In July 2023, the federal probe found no breaches of animal welfare rules apart from a 2019 incident the company had already reported.) In 2023, Neuralink got permission from the FDA to begin testing with humans. That year, Neuralink raised around $325 million from investors who valued the company in excess of $3 billion. In 2024, Neuralink announced its first human participant: Noland Arbaugh, a thirtysomething quadriplegic, was implanted with a wireless chip smaller and supposedly more powerful than the Utah Array. Although far less invasive than procedures at labs like Caltech’s, Neuralink’s implant still involved a small part of the skull being permanently removed; the implant sits in this space with a flap of skin on top. A neurosurgeon oversaw the robot’s surgery, but the company’s ultimate goal is to fully automate the procedure. With practice, Arbaugh was able to use the BCI to control a computer cursor and play video games. But there were problems. Only a month after his surgery, around 85 percent of the threads implanted in his brain had come loose. In August 2024, it announced a second participant, implanted with a more advanced chip that enabled him to design 3D objects using computer-aided design software. In late January, Neuralink posted a clip of a robotic arm writing on a whiteboard, supposedly under the control of a third participant, and on April 27, Musk shared a video of this participant, who has ALS and is unable to speak, describing how his implant had enabled him to communicate again via a computer. More recently, the number of patients has accelerated, with Neuralink claiming it now has nine human participants. Like studies at academic labs, all of Neuralink’s participants are paralyzed. While Musk has more recently hailed the potential for Neuralink to restore a person’s ability to walk or even cure their dementia, he has more often alluded to a different objective. During an hourlong presentation in July 2024, Musk claimed that anyone with his implants would soon be able to communicate faster than a person with a fully functional body. “We want to give people superpowers,” he said. SO FAR, NEURALINK HAS LARGELY built on achievements already demonstrated in the field — cursor control, click control, and robotic arm control. “How I would see it is they’re basically checking off these milestones,” the expert in touch with Neuralink staff tells Rolling Stone. “Everything Musk does attracts an outsized level of attention…. I think most scientists prefer other people to measure the significance of their work, whereas Musk is doing the opposite, and labeling everything he’s done as brand new and significant.” There are unique elements to Neuralink’s BCI, such as the robotic surgery used to implant it, as well as the wireless technology. But other companies use even less-invasive methods. Precision Neuroscience, founded by a former Neuralink co-founder, has developed a flexible electrode array thinner than a human hair, which the company describes as “minimally invasive.” Synchron is testing a device that’s inserted into the brain through a blood vessel; the company also uses a generative chat feature powered by OpenAI to assist relevant participants with communication (it was recently reported that OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman is raising funds for a BCI startup that would compete with Neuralink). And the method of implanting electrode threads into the cortex was first developed by Philip Sabes while he worked at UCSF, before he left and co-founded Neuralink. There are also downsides to going wireless. Caltech postdoc David Bjånes notes that, while Neuralink’s device records neurons from more channels than, for example, the 384 channels provided by six Utah Arrays as in Buckwalter’s case, it currently only records from one brain area — by contrast, Caltech’s devices record from five brain areas concurrently. With different participants having implants in different parts of the brain, the researchers have a more holistic view of how the brain performs various functions. Neuralink’s device also transmits a compressed version of its brain signal due to bandwidth limitations from being wireless, whereas Caltech can record uncompressed, high bandwidth broadband signals on all their channels. “As a scientist, I am not willing to sacrifice signal if I don’t have to,” Bjånes says. “A wired solution that gives me as much signal as possible — I’m going to choose that every time over another technology.” For patients, there’s a huge advantage to a wireless BCI, but that comes at the expense of gaining new knowledge about the brain that can help future patients. “I think the wireless technology will get there,” Bjånes says. “It just is not quite mature enough.” Previously, Neuralink has been pilloried for its lack of transparency. After Musk announced on X in January 2024 that the first human had been implanted with Neuralink’s device, experts in the field and former regulatory staff expressed concerns at the piecemeal doling out of information, with specific criticism for not registering its trial at the National Institute of Health’s website ClinicalTrials.gov — a common practice even for so-called “early feasibility” devices like Neuralink’s. Medical ethicists described Neuralink’s and Musk’s approach as “science by press release.” In May, Neuralink did register on ClinicalTrials.gov and has since shared more details of its studies. But it’s still unclear, for example, how its robotic surgery exactly works, at least to anyone outside Neuralink. And as Musk continues to make bold claims in an increasingly competitive field, experts note that, given past concerns raised by Neuralink employees, something could go wrong and set the field back years both in terms of willing participants and private investors due to the long shadow Musk casts. “The ‘move fast, break things, and fix it later’ philosophy of Big Tech is going to be disastrous if applied to BCIs,” says Rajesh Rao, the University of Washington professor, who argues that commercial companies like Neuralink should embed ethicists in their teams. A former Neuralink engineer tells Rolling Stone it is “hard for anything to advance super fast for a class 3 medical device,” noting that every advance takes “immense effort,” testing and preclinical/clinical trials. And they claim the company moves fast “without compromising safety.” Even so, concerns about Neuralink’s impact on the field only grew in the wake of Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) instigating mass layoffs of federal staff, some directly impacting Neuralink. This sparked concern that guardrails around approval for Neuralink trials had been removed. Phyllis Fong, the USDA’s longtime inspector general who launched the ongoing probe into Neuralink for alleged animal cruelty, was forced out of her job in January. In mid-February, 20 staff members in the FDA office of neurological and physical medicine devices, including several who oversaw Neuralink, were also fired. (Shortly after layoffs in the FDA, hundreds were reportedly asked to rejoin, though it is unclear if any staff specifically reviewing Neuralink were rehired.) The cuts included reviewers overseeing clinical-trial applications by Neuralink and other companies creating BCI devices. (In April, Neuralink also falsely self-certified as a “small disadvantaged business” on a federal filing, qualifying Musk’s company for funding aimed at promoting racial and ethnic diversity. As of this summer, there wasn’t evidence that they’d received the funding.) In response to criticism that Musk was removing officials responsible for regulating his companies, the White House insisted at the time that he had pledged to avoid conflicts of interest. BUCKWALTER WAS ONLY 17 when he leapt from high rocks into the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, breaking his neck and doing irreparable damage to his spinal cord. He spent a year in a state hospital for what were then called “crippled” children. While some of the other injured kids were in and out within a month, Buckwalter’s convalescence was slow. “I kind of had to stumble my way along,” he says. “It was the dark ages of rehabilitation medicine.” But Buckwalter did find his way, and he has gone on to live a full life by any measure. He ended up being a researcher for 15 years, writing a paper on estrogen replacement therapy for women diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease that is still cited often, as is his groundbreaking research into so-called “mommy brain” cognition during pregnancy, which landed him on morning news shows in the 1990s. Buckwalter conducted initial research and wrote the matching algorithm for the dating website eHarmony, founded in 2000. For a quarter century, Buckwalter has also been the frontman of a David Bowie-inspired rock band called Siggy, which still performs live. Many quadriplegics don’t make it to Buckwalter’s age. “Fifty years post-spinal cord injury is a pretty small population of folks,” he says. In 2023, a friend and colleague who had a neuroscience Ph.D. from Caltech told him about a lab at the private university in Pasadena researching brain implants. The surgery itself involved cutting into Buckwalter’s skull to install six Utah arrays. The implants are designed to both “read” and “write”: The electrodes record neurons firing as well as stimulating activity. Buckwalter’s pioneering case also involves the world’s first chronic implant inside the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where high-level reasoning and possible participation in language takes place. Even in the inherently more cautious academic sphere of BCIs, there are challenges for participants like Buckwalter. After falling earlier this year, he fractured his femur and damaged one of the pedestals protruding from his head, and it has taken Caltech’s neurosurgeons some time to bring the affected arrays online. He has also belatedly realized he doesn’t technically have ownership of his data — the information gathered from his brain by the arrays during lab work with Caltech — which complicates a proposed collaboration over the creation of a virtual clone of Buckwalter with a former student of his, Thomas Parsons, working in AI at Arizona State University. Parsons has been scraping anything Buckwalter has ever written or said on record to integrate into a large language model. This plan is to have Buckwalter’s BCI interact directly with his virtual clone, offering unprecedented insights into the holy grail of neuroscience — the mechanics of consciousness itself. But if Buckwalter can’t access his Caltech data, the ambitious project may be imperilled. Buckwalter and other brain implantees are now trying to collectively organize behind a so-called BCI Pioneers manifesto, and are working with an attorney on a consent form addendum for all brain implant procedures. Buckwalter has proposed the catchy slogan: “My brain, my data.” THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES between academic researchers and commercial companies — and yet the fates of both are bound together. “The failure and success of any one of us is all of ours,” Bjånes says. One way of warding off this danger could be by greater collaboration between companies and academic research labs. One company, Onward Medical, collaborates with Rao’s center at the University of Washington, and another called Blackrock Neurotech, which produces the Utah Array, collaborates with multiple research labs. Neuralink has made no such collaboration public. Experts speaking to Rolling Stone say Neuralink clearly has an important role to play in the field’s future, both in raising public awareness and the transformative potential of the company achieving its goal of implanting thousands of humans. “Neuralink’s strength is in its ability to commercialize such an intricate piece of tech,” says the ex-Neuralink engineer. “Sure, this has existed in labs, but no one can feasibly bring it to market at scale.” Currently only a handful of participants are signed up to each academic research lab. If Neuralink’s work means there are many more participants with BCIs, and Musk releases the API to enable other researchers to access the data, it could be a game changer. Given Neuralink’s relative opacity, that seems unlikely. At the same time, Musk continues to make fantastical-sounding claims. Last year he predicted that within two decades, hundreds of millions of people would be using Neuralink’s implants. He envisions a future in which his company inaugurates superhuman cyborgs — a techno-dystopian “symbiosis” with machines and artificial intelligence. AI has an important role to play with BCIs, particularly via the use of large language models (LLM) to assist the decoding of speech, learning an individual’s repeated patterns of speech and generating a voice that sounds like their own. AI has also helped patients communicate as with rival company Synchron’s OpenAI-powered generative chat feature. Musk’s leading contribution to the AI field so far has been Grok. But his X-native chatbot has repeatedly caused controversy, whether ranting about “white genocide” in South Africa or praising Hitler, and replying to users with antisemitic comments. There may be reason to fear what Musk could do with experimental brain tech after seeing how Grok has turned out. Meanwhile, Musk’s big claims about brain implants’ potential could end up triggering a public backlash as was seen in the 1970s. They even highlight a rift in President Trump’s coalition between the tech right and those wary of Big Tech. Former top Trump strategist Steve Bannon, a staunch critic of Musk’s transhumanist philosophy, warned in January that within 10 years, brain chips would threaten humanity as we know it, as people could face a dilemma over whether to enhance themselves or fall behind peers.

Then He Smuggled $500 Million Worth of Cocaine in One Night UCSF’s Edward Chang sees his lab’s place in the field as distinct from many commercial companies. “My goal, ultimately, is quite different,” he says. Instead of Musk’s sci-fi enhancement dream, Chang’s research seeks new knowledge that can relieve the suffering of his patients, and even more importantly, “trying to understand who we are as humans,” he says. “I think ultimately, that’s a much more ambitious goal than enhancement.” Using BCIs to advance our understanding of the brain comes at a moment when artificial intelligence also poses existential questions for humanity. As Chang says, “I personally think that it’s more important than ever, actually, to understand what makes us human.” photographs in illustration by JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images; Adobe Stock, 2 We want to hear it.

Solana (SOL) has solidified its position among the world’s largest cryptocurrencies, surpassing Binance Coin (BNB) to secure the fifth spot by market capitalization. As of September 12, 2025, SOL trades at $ 237.90, giving it a market capitalization of $126.4 billion. The rally marks a 6.8% gain in the past 24 hours and over 15% weekly growth, driven by surging institutional interest and strong on-chain activity. Analysts stress three key catalysts behind Solana’s momentum: Nasdaq’s approval of a Solana-focused listing, growing speculation over spot ETFs, and continuous network upgrades that strengthen its position as Ethereum’s closest competitor. A major driver of the rally was Galaxy Digital’s reported purchase of 2.31 million SOL tokens worth nearly $536 million within 24 hours. Blockchain data confirms transfers from Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit to Galaxy-controlled wallets, fueling speculation that the firm is aggressively backing Solana’s growth. This move follows Galaxy’s leadership in a $1.65 billion private placement for Forward Industries (NASDAQ: FORD), which is transitioning into a Solana-focused digital asset treasury. Forward’s stock soared 135% in five days, proving investor excitement. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz declared the start of a “Solana Season,” citing regulatory progress, ETF optimism, and Solana’s unmatched scalability as reasons for the aggressive accumulation. ETF speculation continues to boost Solana’s appeal. Reports suggest a 90% chance of a Solana ETF approval by late 2025, with applications from VanEck and Fidelity already in review. With staking yields around 7%, analysts believe Solana is well-positioned to attract yield-focused ETF structures. Meanwhile, Solana’s network fundamentals remain robust. August data shows 58 million monthly active users and $15.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), fueled by activity across DeFi, NFTs, and memecoins. Recent upgrades, including the Alpenglow upgrade and the upcoming Firedancer client, promise greater scalability and reduced congestion. With institutional capital flooding in, ETF approvals on the horizon, and technical upgrades boosting performance, Solana’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Analysts now eye potential price targets between $300 and $400 in the coming months if bullish conditions persist. Cover image from ChatGPT, SOLUSD For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Should You Invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account (QREARX)?
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/qrearx-tiaa-real-estate/
Time Published: 2025-09-13T06:30:20Z
Full Content:
I get asked lots of questions about specific investments. Mostly, the question is asking me to look into my crystal ball and tell them what will provide the best return over their investment period. Aside from the fact that I'm not licensed to recommend specific investments (or paid to do so; even for our real estate sponsors, we only introduce, not recommend), the main issue here is that my crystal ball is usually about as cloudy as that of the person asking the question. However, I get this particular version of the question often enough that it seemed worth a blog post. “I practice in an academic setting and, like many of us at academic institutions, I have access to TIAA’s Real Estate Account. I have not been able to find any high-quality reviews of this account to help decide if it is worth investing in, and I was wondering if your team would be up for writing an article about it to provide us with your insight. Some questions that come to mind are whether it is a good investment compared to other direct real estate investing opportunities, if TIAA is considered competitive as an investing institution in the real estate world, and if the benefits of being able to invest in it in a 403(b) outweigh the tax benefits real estate investments offer investors in taxable accounts.” I have known about the TIAA Real Estate Account (fund) for decades, although I admit I don't follow it particularly closely, as it has never been accessible to me as an investment. TIAA-CREF provides a lot of 403(b)s across the country to academics, teachers, and others, and it is generally considered one of the better retirement account providers—or at least it was a decade or two ago before investing became pretty much free with the advent of sub-10 basis point index funds from providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, Blackrock, and more. The draw of the TIAA fund is that it provides DIRECT investments into real estate, rather than just buying shares of publicly traded REITs. That means there is one less layer between you and the actual investment. Presumably, that would reduce costs and reduce volatility and correlation with the overall stock market, like other direct real estate investments. Of course, one can very reasonably argue that the volatility of private real estate isn't reduced; it's just hidden due to assets not being marked to market regularly. Presumably, QREARX does have to mark to market more regularly than most direct investments, given its high liquidity. When I first learned about this fund two decades ago, I heard people speak positively about it and assumed it was pretty good, but then I forgot about it because I never had a 403(b) with access to it. Imagine my surprise when I looked it up and learned that maybe it wasn't all that awesome. Take a look at this chart from Morningstar accessed in May 2025. The top line is fund performance, and the third line is the performance of its category. See what I mean? Ten-year returns of 3% and even 15-year returns of 6% are pretty hard to get excited about. Real estate hasn't done as well as US large cap tech stocks over the last 15 years, but it hasn't been a bad asset class in which to invest. Let's compare it to my preferred publicly traded real estate investment, the Vanguard Real Estate Index fund (VNQ). This fund/ETF owns all the equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) traded on US markets. That 1.5% lower per year (15-year returns of 7.73% vs. 6.20%) isn't as bad as I expected, but it's still a substantial underperformance. It looks even worse over the last five years with an underperformance of 6.5% a year. It really makes you wonder what has been happening at QREARX in the last five years. Like private real estate investments, QREARX isn't marked to market as quickly as VNQ. I'm not surprised to see the delay in the poor returns, just as we saw with MANY private real estate investments that had rough years in 2023 and 2024, especially when compared to the overall stock market. QREARX VNQ If you read its documents, you can learn a lot about how an account/fund/annuity/whatever actually operates. Let me quote from it: “The Real Estate Account is designed as an option for retirement and tax-deferred savings plans for employees of non-profit and governmental institutions. Investment Objective: The Real Estate Account seeks to generate favorable total returns primarily through the rental income and appreciation of a diversified portfolio of directly held, private real estate investments and real estate-related investments, while offering investors guaranteed, daily liquidity. Investment Strategy: Real Estate-Related Investments. The Account intends to have between 75% and 85% of its net assets invested directly in real estate or real estate-related investments with the goal of producing favorable long-term returns primarily through rental income and appreciation. These investments may consist of: The Account’s principal strategy is to purchase direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, including the four primary sectors of office, industrial, retail, and multi-family, and alternative real estate sectors (defined as real estate outside of the four primary sectors noted above). In addition, the Account is authorized to hold up to 25% of its net assets in liquid real estate-related securities, including publicly traded REITs and CMBS. Management intends that the Account will not hold more than 10% of net assets in such securities on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2024, the Account did not hold any publicly traded REITs or CMBS.” The document also notes that 15%-25% of the fund's money can be invested in liquid securities like Treasury bonds and money market funds. More information here: How to Start Investing in Real Estate The Tax-Advantaged Income from Our Passive Real Estate Investments I'm sure plenty of people love investing in QREARX. It has $22.6 billion in it. Let's consider what they probably like. The first pro of QREARX is that it provides you with a way to invest in real estate in your TIAA-CREF 403(b). You'll enjoy some tax efficiency from having your real estate investment in a retirement account. And if a huge chunk of your money is in this account, it may be the only way to have a substantial real estate investment in your portfolio. The second pro of QREARX is that it allows you to invest more directly in real estate than via a REIT mutual fund, such as VNQ. That likely results in less volatility. Of course, that works both ways. In 2021, VNQ was up 41%, but QREARX was only up 18%. On the downside, VNQ dropped 26% in 2022, and QREARX only dropped 17% across 2023-2024. All else equal, lower volatility is good. QREARX provides daily liquidity, like a typical mutual fund. That's very different from most direct real estate investments, which are generally private and offer much less liquidity. However, it does limit you to transacting once a quarter (presumably to prevent market timing) on the day of your choice. This account has only been around since 1995, but frankly, that's an eternity in the private real estate space. Few syndicators and private fund managers have been in business anywhere near that long (blog sponsor MLG is a notable exception). And TIAA itself has been around for more than a century (1918). Like investing in VNQ, you don't have to spend a lot of time worrying about being the victim of a scam here or TIAA going bankrupt. That's often not the case in the private real estate world. This investment is in your 403(b), so there is zero tax preparation required for it. That's definitely NOT the case for a portfolio of syndications or funds sending you multi-state K-1s or having to file multiple Schedule Es each year for your direct real estate investments. VNQ is just as passive as QREARX, and many private funds are similarly passive, at least after the initial due diligence. But lots of real estate takes a whole lot more work than that. Like any investment, there are pros AND cons. QREARX is no different. But the cons depend on your comparison. You have to invest in SOMETHING. Although all real estate is optional, it seemed most reasonable to compare it to the other real estate investments typically used by white coat investors rather than stocks, bonds, or some other asset class. These include public REITs via something like VNQ, passive private syndications and funds similar to those on our real estate sponsor list, and truly direct ownership of income-producing rental property (aka landlording) like we teach in our No Hype Real Estate Investment online course. Investing in VNQ, like most Vanguard index funds, is awfully close to free. The expense ratio is 0.13%. That's not the 0-5 basis points you see on a total stock market fund these days, but it's still a whole lot closer to free than most funds charge. On the other hand, QREARX charges more or less the classic “1% a year.” In fact, it's slightly more at 1.015% a year. Those fees/expenses have to come from your returns. There is no other place to take them from. Fee comparison with private passive investments is a lot more challenging. At first glance, they seem a lot higher—often something like 1% plus 20% of returns above 8% or so. But you have to keep in mind that some of those fees are often going to the expenses of running the investment itself. Those expenses aren't included in the ER of VNQ. It's not entirely clear how operating expenses show up with QREARX. Some private investments (like the DLP funds) don't charge you any fees until you've received your preferred return. QREARX isn't offering anything like that. I'm not sure how else to describe the last decade or two of returns for the TIAA Real Estate Account. They're obviously lower than those provided by the even more liquid and significantly cheaper VNQ. They also seem to be quite a bit lower than the returns offered by most passive private real estate investments. Let's compare a somewhat similar investment, the DLP Housing Fund. This fund isn't as liquid, although it does offer more liquidity (annual redemptions) than most private real estate investments. It is, like QREARX, evergreen—also unlike most real estate investments. How has it been doing the last few years? Let's take a look. Unfortunately, Morningstar doesn't make a nice little graph every day for private real estate investments, but I carefully track my own returns in all of these investments. I invested $250,000 in this fund in June 2021 and have an annualized return from then until the end of April 2025 of 13% a year. By year, the returns look like this: Needless to say, 13% is way better than whatever QREARX has done over that time period—perhaps by as much as 11%-12% a year. They're both actively managed real estate funds and past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance, but you do have to ask yourself how much you trust the QREARX manager to do better after an underperformance like that. Even if I had just gone with VNQ, I'd be significantly ahead of QREARX. I could have taken less risk, too, and done better. Real estate debt funds have performed just fine over the last five years. We own three of them (including the DLP Lending Fund), and our returns for that asset class are a very stable 9.56% per year since we started investing in it in 2017. Now, not every private real estate turned in better performance than QREARX, but most of mine did. While it's not necessarily an indicator of future performance, low returns may be my biggest con about the TIAA Real Estate Account. QREARX may be available to you. But it's not available to me or most white coat investors—at least not without changing jobs or at least opening an IRA with TIAA-CREF. You can probably only put as much money in it as you have in your TIAA 403(b). Unlike a private equity real estate investment, you can't put it in a taxable account and enjoy passive income sheltered by depreciation. And if you use your 403(b) space for real estate, that means you can't put something else (bonds?) in there. More information here: How the IRS Treats You as a Real Estate Investor The 60+ Worst Mistakes You Can Make in Real Estate Investing While I find the concept of a liquid direct real estate investment available to non-accredited investors in their employer-provided retirement accounts very interesting, it's hard for me to get over the additional expenses and lower returns seen with QREARX. And if you're really interested in putting in some time and effort into real estate investing, you're probably not going to end up in this fund. What do you think? Do you invest in the TIAA Real Estate Account? Why or why not? What do you like/dislike about it? I was curious why QREARX has such middling returns even compared to VNQ and did a little digging. I think it might be because it is relatively conservative in its loan-to-value ratio. From the fund’s 8-K: “As of March 31, 2025, the Account’s loan-to-value ratio was approximately 18.0%.” https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/performance/REA_FAQ.pdf For comparison, the three largest REITS in VNQ are WELL (debt to equity of 0.45), PLD (debt to equity of around 0.6) and AMT (leverage ratio of 5.1). All have much higher internal leverage. 18% LTV is extremely conservative in the real estate investing world. My university notified employees that TIAA is facing a class action suit for rigging their retirement calculator to nearly always recommend their annuities and their real estate fund. I had tried out the calculator using several risk strategies and was surprised that it recommended those investments even when this made no sense. I, for example, have plenty of savings to replace my income at retirement and also have a real estate partnership and age 70 SS funding—the calculator still recommended both funds. Interesting.

The world’s largest asset manager will announce a data centre partnership with Digital Gravity Partners, one of a string of deals to be announced during President Trump’s state visit, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 13 September 2025 06:32, UK The world’s largest money manager will use President Trump’s state visit to the UK next week to unveil a £500m plan to invest in UK data centres, one of the fastest-growing areas of global infrastructure spending. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock plans to announce a joint venture with Digital Gravity Partners, a digital infrastructure investment manager, that will focus on acquiring and modernising existing data centres to improve their capacity. The project will be among dozens hailed by the government as evidence of the strength of the economic partnership between Britain and the US, as President Trump arrives in the UK against the politically tumultuous backdrop of Lord Mandelson's sacking as the US ambassador. BlackRock, which has more than $12.5 trillion in assets under management, has a significant presence in Britain, and will next week open a new Edinburgh office employing about 1,300 people. Earlier this week, Sky News revealed that Larry Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, would be part of the business delegation accompanying President Trump on the state visit. Other bosses in attendance will include Jensen Huang of Nvidia, the world's most valuable public company, and Sam Altman of ChatGPT architect OpenAI. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the two companies would launch a multibillion-pound investment in the UK next week that will form part of the vast $500bn Stargate data centre project. Trump sues New York Times Face-to-face with Zelenskyy, his frustration with the West is clear Zelenskyy demands 'clear position' from Trump on ending war The vast quantities being spent on artificial intelligence-related data centre infrastructure around the world represents one of the most important trends in the global economy, with the attendant strains on power resources also being throw into sharp focus. The government hopes to announce early next week aggregate figures for investment and job creation that will rival the £63bn it claimed to have secured as a result of last October's International Investment Summit, according to insiders. Critically, at a difficult time for an economy which official data shows is flat lining, the string of major corporate announcements will be hailed by Sir Keir Starmer's administration as evidence that Britain remains a top global destination for foreign investment. The Office for Investment, which was recently given a beefed-up role in Whitehall, has been involved in coordinating many of the deals to be announced next week, which will encompass energy, financial services, nuclear power and technology, according to insiders. Corporate and Whitehall sources said that BlackRock's £500m data centre deal would reflect the efforts of the prime minister, his business adviser Varun Chandra and chancellor Rachel Reeves to strengthen the government's relationship with the asset management behemoth during the last year. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Dozens of bosses will attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III during next week's trip. President Trump's visit will, however, come amid tensions over his tariff regime, with continuing uncertainty about the impact on British manufacturing sectors, including steel. There are also continuing tensions between the UK government and major drugmakers over pricing, with the US administration pressuring pharmaceutical companies to slash the price of prescription medicines in the US. BlackRock declined to comment.

Title: Return of ‘world class’ Aoife Wafer just what the doctor ordered ahead of France clash

Time Published: 2025-09-13T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
She’s only 22 and she has only played 15 Tests, but Aoife Wafer’s name stands out above all others in the Ireland team to play France in Sunday’s World Cup quarter-final (Sandy Park, Exeter, kick-off 1pm). Of course, this is largely because of her long-awaited return from knee surgery in July. But it’s not just that. When the former Irish player Jenny Murphy underlined the importance of Wafer’s return by simply describing her as “world class” on Second Captains this week, it wasn’t remotely wide of the mark. After all, Wafer has been named on the World Dream Team and was also the RPI’s Players’ Player of the Year and Young Player of the year in 2024. That all came before her coronation as the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship. She earned the latter honour despite missing the last-day loss to Scotland. In four games, Wafer scored four tries, which was the joint highest for a forward. She made 70 carries – the most of any player in the tournament – for a staggering 424.7 metres and beat 17 defenders, the second highest of any forward. Her two tries inspired the 36-10 statement win over Australia in Belfast at the start of last season, as did her two early tries in the ensuing win over New Zealand at WXV1 in Vancouver – powering over first from a tap penalty and then off a five-metre scrum. While this team has strong carriers in Brittany Hogan and Grace Moore, it’s doubtful any other Irish player would have scored them. Similarly, Wafer’s two tries inspired the comeback which came up just short against France in Belfast last March but which fuels belief ahead of this quarter-final, as well as another brace in the win over Wales. It’s not just the tries. Wafer can bend games to her sheer will with her carrying beyond contact, turnovers and tackling, It’s a huge ask, no doubt, for Wafer to magically rediscover her best rugby in a first outing since April, but it’s a gamble worth taking. Better to get 50 or 60 minutes out of her from the start than 20 or 30 at the end, and maybe wonder what might have been. Besides, as former Ireland international Alan Quinlan suggested during the week, the Irish management may well have opted to increase Wafer’s training load last week in preference to giving her a cameo off the bench against New Zealand last Sunday. As with this World Cup and her career, it’s clear that Wafer’s athleticism, strength and footballing ability has been fuelled by a fierce competitive nature and passion for the game, as well as her rugby roots. From Ballygarrett in Wexford, Wafer and her younger sister Orla used to watch their two older brothers play rugby in Gorey RFC. One of the boys, Sean, played for a Leinster Under-18s club side. She eventually nagged their mother Samantha into letting her play as well. Wafer also recalls passing time in the car one day with her brothers by naming as many Irish players as they could. “They were there naming Johnny Sexton, Brian O’Driscoll and all these big names in the men’s team and I named the whole women’s panel. It was a 38-player squad and I named every single one of them. They just sat there and said ‘no, you can’t do it that like’.” In the days before replica women’s jerseys could be bought, the former Ireland women’s coach Philip ‘Goose’ Doyle sent an autographed Irish jersey to Wafer for her tenth birthday. It has been hanging on her bedroom wall ever since and has since been joined by one of her own. At 12, she stopped playing with the boys team in Gorey and transferred to the girls’ Under-15 team before moving to Enniscorthy RFC at 18. It was an important staging post where she switched from a bossy little scrumhalf to a backrower, before moving on to Blackrock and Leinster. On foot of captaining the Ireland Under-18 side, her mother received a call from the IRFU offering Wafer a full-time contract with the Ireland sevens. She relayed that news to her daughter after collecting her from school. It came with a proviso that she first complete her Leaving Cert. That was fine by her. Wafer always wanted to go into healthcare in either medicine or physiotherapy and duly studied the latter in UCD. Alas, days after her Ireland XVs debut in the 2022 Six Nations against Italy in Musgrave Park, the then 19-year-old tore her hamstring in sevens training. Between that and other things, Wafer didn’t win her second cap for another 560 days. That came as a replacement in the WXV 15-13 win against Spain in Dubai in 2023. In the 2024 Six Nations, she was twice player of the round before her 2024-25 breakout campaign. She is not shy about stating her desire to become the best player in the world and, to that end, is joining Harlequins this season. They’re in for a treat, not least as she can play the uilleann pipes, tin whistle, classical flute and the traditional flute. She brings her flute or tin whistle on rugby trips. As her Irish debut song, Wafer famously belted out Miley Cyrus’s Party In The USA on the pitch with her teammates. But after a pre-match meal of pancakes and some chill-out music, she’ll listen to a track or two of traditional Irish music. She’s been missed, but she’s back and will revive her familiar matchday routine ahead of this quarter-final. It’s not stretching things to suggest that, with Wafer in the team, Ireland have a better chance of winning it.

Title: Ondo Finance Surges 20% Weekly Amid Hype and Growing DeFi Demand

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ondo Finance (ONDO) has risen as one of the top performers in the market this week, surging 20% to trade around $1.10. The rally comes as demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates, pushing Ondo’s TVL to record highs. The recently launched Ondo Global Markets platform has been a major growth driver, attracting over $160 million in assets within days. The service enables investors to access tokenized versions of more than 100 stocks and ETFs, including Tesla, Nvidia, and Google. By bringing Wall Street assets onto the blockchain, Ondo is positioning itself as a leader in the $26 billion RWA tokenization market. Analysts argue that this move could transform global investing, particularly for users outside the U.S., who have traditionally faced barriers to stock market participation. Beyond its equities platform, Ondo Finance has seen explosive growth across its ecosystem. TVL on its DeFi protocols has surged from $563 million earlier this year to more than $1.57 billion today. This spike is primarily fueled by Ondo’s yield-bearing products, such as: The firm’s lending arm, Flux, has also expanded rapidly, now managing $42 million in assets compared to just $4 million last November. Like Aave’s Horizon, Flux lets users borrow stablecoins against tokenized U.S. Treasuries, creating new liquidity avenues. Ondo has also launched its own blockchain, tailored for tokenization, which strengthens its moat in a sector projected to reach trillions of dollars in value. Technically, Ondo has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal signal. The token recently broke past the $1.05 resistance and is now eyeing a breakout above $1.145, last seen in July. A successful move could open the door toward $1.18 and even $1.26 in the short term. However, traders are watching closely for profit-taking risks, as ONDO’s relative strength index (RSI) signals overbought conditions. Regardless, with BlackRock signaling blockchain-based ETFs and Fed rate cuts expected to fuel a broader risk rally, momentum could remain in Ondo’s favor. If sustained, Ondo Finance’s surge not only grows its role as a DeFi leader but also builds the fast-growing demand for tokenized real-world assets.

Title: Why ONDO faces bearish risk despite double-digit price gains

ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at the key supply zones just above the current market price of $1.08. The launch of Fidelity’s FDIT on-chain money market fund highlighted ONDO’s growing list of top-tier asset manager partnerships, but the price movement in the coming days might not reflect intense bullishness. Major asset managers continued to tokenize traditional financial products. Fidelity launched the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT) on the 10th of September. It is an on-chain money market fund backed by U.S. Treasuries, mostly from Ondo Finance’s [ONDO] Short-Term U.S. Treasuries Fund (OUSG) as the only anchor and largest investor. In doing so, Fidelity joined BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton in offering tokenized money market or Treasury funds. Since the OUSG launch in June 2023, Ondo Finance was one of the first tokens with on-chain access to U.S. Treasuries. Over the past two days, ONDO has gained 14.1%, rallying from $0.95 to $1.08. Bitcoin [BTC] was up 3.3% and Ethereum [ETH] climbed 5.4% during the same period, helping explain ONDO’s bullish sentiment. However, technical analysis showed that the token was headed toward a supply zone, and traders and investors should be wary of a trend reversal. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView The 1-day market structure was bullish, and the key swing high and low were marked in orange. They were at $1.17 and $0.85, respectively, while a range formation (white) was also identified. ONDO has traded within this range since July. At the time of writing, the price was at a key supply zone from mid-August at $1.08. Another 7% move higher would take ONDO to the range highs. However, it was unclear if the current move could reach the range highs. The CMF on the daily timeframe was below -0.05, showing strong capital outflow from the market. Even though the MACD showcased bullish momentum, the seller dominance was not overthrown. Therefore, ONDO swing traders should be on the lookout for a bearish trend reversal at $1.08 and $1.17. Sustained buying pressure and high trading volume alongside a breakout past $1.17 would be a strong bullish signal in the coming weeks, but until then, the range formation would likely be respected.

Crypto exchange Gemini hit a $4.4 billion valuation on its Nasdaq debut Friday. At the time of writing, the company’s shares—which trade under the GEMI ticker symbol—are hovering around $34. That’s a 22.6% gain from when the stock began trading. Gemini was founded in 2014 and granted a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services the following year. The company raised $425 million through its IPO, according to Decrypt calculations based on regulatory filings. Reuters was first to report yesterday that the firm’s IPO was significantly oversubscribed. But there’s been drama brewing between the company’s founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chair nominee Brian Quintenz. The CFTC nominee shared screenshots of a July text thread with Tyler on X. The messages show that Quintenz was contacted about a complaint Gemini filed regarding alleged misconduct at the regulator. Gemini paid $5 million to settle its CFTC lawsuit in January, just a few weeks before the trial was set to begin. But in June, the company’s lawyers filed a complaint alleging the CFTC was wrong to have gone after the exchange in the first place. “I believe these texts make it clear what they were after from me, and what I refused to promise,” he wrote. “It’s my understanding that after this exchange they contacted the President and asked that my confirmation be paused for reasons other than what is reflected in these texts.” There were a few people in the thread calling foul on his timing, especially given that his current firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has a large stake in Gemini’s direct competitor, Coinbase. Gemini is the most recent, but not the only crypto company to make its big public debut this week. Crypto lender Figure began trading on the Nasdaq under the FIGR ticker Thursday, seeing shares jump 24%. The firm stepped into public trading with an even bigger, $5.3 billion valuation. Its share price ahead of the closing bell on Friday sits around $33.46, about 33% above its $25 IPO price. “Our IPO showed what’s possible when blockchain meets capital markets: speed, transparency, efficiency,” the company said Friday on X. “IPO day was a celebration of our people, partners, and the vision driving us forward, and we’re even more excited for what’s next.” Figure CEO Michael Tannenbaum told Decrypt that the company is showing Wall Street how blockchains can be used to create more efficient markets for real-world assets, while also helping investors better grasp concepts like tokenization. Tokenization—that is, taking real-world assets such as stocks and creating blockchain-based equivalents—has been getting a lot of buzz lately. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, Blackrock is considering tokenizing its ETFs. No, not just BUIDL, its flagship tokenized fund launched with Securitize in 2024. The scope for this move would be much broader—and bring trillions worth of dollars with it. Even Nasdaq has expressed interest to the SEC in allowing tokenized stocks to trade on its exchanges. The company proposed that issuers would get to opt in to having tokenized versions of their securities trade. Crypto exchange Coinbase has claimed that the SEC has done “irreparable harm” by destroying documents from its Gary Gensler era. "The Gensler SEC destroyed documents they were required to preserve and produce,” Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote on X Thursday, alongside a link to the court filing. “We now have proof from the SEC's own Inspector General." A report last week by the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General found that nearly a year of then-Chairman Gary Gensler's text messages were permanently deleted between October 2022 and September 2023. Coinbase has been pursuing internal SEC documents for a long time through the Freedom of Information Act and sued when the regulator denied its requests. DAT worked: Newly minted digital asset treasury GameStop notched a Q2 loss in its earnings report—but not as bad as it might have been. The company noted its $500 million worth of Bitcoin increased in value to $528 million by the end of the quarter. Land of the rising BTC: Japanese Bitcoin treasury Metaplanet wants to raise $1.45 billion to buy more BTC.

Photos by Billie Winter For nearly two years, every sunrise in Gaza has brought more death, destruction, and dislocation. To be Palestinian today is to live under unrelenting bombardment, displacement, and starvation, your community rendered a target by an Israeli regime that openly declares its intent of eradication. It is to watch American leaders respond not with outrage but with plans envisioning luxury “Gaza Riviera” resorts and surveillance states on the same land where children’s bones are visible from hunger and their bodies are charred by US-funded bombs. This is not a natural disaster. It is a human-made horror. And yet, to be Palestinian is also to persist. To insist on life in the bowels of doom. To keep organizing, cooking, singing, teaching, and loving because to surrender your humanity is to surrender what can never be taken by force. There is no greater defiance than the will to live, to dance, to gather, even when the world seems indifferent to your existence. That is what makes this year’s second annual Palestine Will Live Forever Festival all the more urgent. It arrives not only as Gaza continues to endure mass death and forced displacement, but as Black, Brown, immigrant, trans, and poor communities across the US face escalating state violence, while reproductive freedom, environmental justice, and democracy itself hang in the balance. Yes, the day will feature an all-star lineup: Macklemore, Prometheus Brown, Fem du lit, Bambu, Jamila Woods, Noura Erakat, Nikkita Oliver, and more, but it is not just a concert. It is a gathering that reminds us that our fates are braided together, that either liberation is collective or it is not at all. Saturday will further testify that our will is not passive. It is the marrow of our survival and the pulse that refuses silence. To love one another in the face of annihilation is a political act. The festival is not merely a celebration; it is a forging. A place where joy becomes a weapon against despair, where solidarity is sharpened into strategy, and where we remember that endurance is not simply to survive, but to triumph. The Stranger spoke with four of this year’s organizers—Maher Joudi, Gabriel Teodros, Nikkita Oliver, and Lexi Peterson-Burge—about what it means to hold space for Palestinian liberation, to model cross-movement solidarity, and to create a festival that feeds the long struggle rather than just marking a single day. The Palestine Will Live Forever Festival takes place Saturday, September 13, from noon to 9 p.m. at Volunteer Park. Tickets are available here. This is the second year of this festival. Every day we’re seeing new horrors in the headlines and on social media. For you all, what was the onus to make sure this happened again? Why was it important to participate—whether organizing, performing, or bringing performers? What was the impetus for doing year two? Maher Joudi: That’s a layered question, man. Personally, even leaving last year, the calls started coming in within a week—people asking if it would happen again. I assumed we’d try to run it back at the start of this year. Then a lot changed with the election of President Trump. We had real conversations about whether it should happen, especially from a safety perspective—this was around when Mahmoud Khalil had just gotten taken. There was a lot to weigh. Ultimately, as a team, we decided it was necessary. Then we talked about intentionality—what this year should look like—because the horrors in Palestine had only gotten worse. And here in the US, our people—Palestinian, Black, Latino, immigrant—were getting taken too. The need for a day like last year’s had grown so much that it felt necessary. Gabriel Teodros: The need to gather—and to normalize resistance—became really clear, especially around the election. Rights were getting stripped at an exponential rate: undocumented people getting snatched, transgender people getting arrested for trying to use the bathroom. The list goes on. If we were going to do the festival—and we should—we wanted it to be about collective liberation, to model how our struggles are connected and our pathways to liberation are bound together. That’s the direction we took. Lexi Peterson-Burge: To be transparent, we as organizers have varied identities, backgrounds, and lived experiences. That informed tough discussions about whether to move forward with a second year. We had hours of conversations about protecting communities and ourselves; about what kind of organizing meets the moment; [about] whether centering joy and a celebration of culture and resistance was appropriate and safe. We asked if it would fill the organizer cup for everyone involved—because our communities were experiencing different kinds of harm at the same time. We landed on this: The source of our communities’ struggles—oppression, genocide, etc.—comes from the same place. The festival could say this isn’t one community’s fight; it’s a collective fight against imperialism and capitalism and all the forces fueling the many ways our communities are being oppressed, historically and now. It gave us a chance to model cross-racial, cross-cultural, cross-movement solidarity—and to center joy as resistance while keeping our people as safe as possible. It took a month or two of serious, hard conversations. I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Nikkita Oliver: I actually stepped back from organizing for a couple months to be sure I was in alignment about why I was participating. “All of us or none of us” is key for me. What’s happening to our communities is due to empire, colonialism, capitalism—rooted in anti-Blackness. Our organizing has to target those structures so we don’t end up with a world where some of us get free at the expense of others. Art and culture are resistance—doing them out loud is resistance. But we have to go further: have present organizing bodies people can plug into. We need not just mobilized communities, but organized communities. So the festival centers intersectionality, resistance, and joy while bringing in those doing hyper-local, national, and global organizing—so when people leave, they have places to plug in. It’s more than a day; it’s a galvanizing moment that feeds the uncelebrated work between the big moments. Having organizers, vendors, and movement workers present helps make that real. There’s so much heaviness, locally, nationally, internationally. How do you balance that while planning an event that centers joy, uplifts, and mobilizes? What has that process been like? Teodros: Helping organize has been a constant reminder of what’s possible—and that we don’t get through this time alone. I’m looking at a screen full of graphics, with Zahyr [Lauren]’s beautiful art staring back at me—what they captured is a reminder of what it’s like when our movements come together. Working on the festival has helped me get through this year emotionally. It’s that daily reminder: it’s collective liberation or not at all. “All of us or none of us”—it’s right there in the name. Peterson-Burge: This year’s been harder for me—energy-wise, emotionally. A lot of organizers burn out, especially those with layered identities who are directly impacted by what’s unfolding. There’s a push-pull: The push is knowing you have to do something to stay whole and authentic, to show up for resistance, joy, and cultural preservation. The pull is that doing this month after month while witnessing harm drains you. Then there’s capitalism—families, bills, survival. Still, I feel obligated to show up for my people. And a big reason I can is this group. We’re honest when something hits hard—“I need a day or two”—and we show up for each other. Without this group, I don’t know that I could keep doing something at this scale right now. Oliver: Last year, the energy to do it came easier—even though it was exhausting. Now it’s a daily barrage: executive orders, neighbors snatched by Gestapo, worsening prison conditions, targeting of gender-expansive trans and queer people, the invisibilizing of Sudan and Congo—so much to hold as an organizer and conscious person. It’s overwhelming. What’s kept me in it is that we’re having the hard conversations—crying with each other, sometimes at each other—and practicing principled struggle. Some won’t see the value because arts and culture are central. I’d argue without arts and culture, we don’t exist—that’s where our stories, histories, poems, relationships live. We engage culture every day—from clothes to music to what we read. Doing principled struggle in a space of art-as-resistance makes me want to keep going, even when it’s exhausting. Also, hearing folks’ energy for it is a reminder of how important gathering is. It’s not always a 3,000-person festival—sometimes it’s dinner, a Zoom, a walk. The constant gathering matters. I’m looking forward to being in community with people who share our values and take this as a call to make our movements as intersectional as possible. Joudi: I agree—this year is harder. I’ve probably had one-on-ones with everyone here saying that. It makes me emotional to hear it out loud. Last year, I was excited—everything was new and fast, and I didn’t have time to grasp the magnitude. This year, with more time and intentionality, I feel pressure: to show up right for our organizing team, my community, and the global community, and to represent ourselves well. I’m the oldest or second oldest on this call, but the youngest in organizing. Every day, I’m learning how to show up with intention and authenticity. I hoped Palestine would be at least a little better by now. It’s 10 times worse. And once you peel back layers, you can’t unsee them. Days are tougher—and organizing becomes a second job. But to Nikkita’s point, the energy from artists, vendors, and community—people asking to be involved—has been real. Only recently did I feel the full magnitude of what this means to the community. That gives you your second, third, 10th wind when a small team is wearing a ton of hats. Knowing what this day will mean to everyone is what keeps me making calls, finishing docs, hopping on Zoom—grounded in why we’re doing it. This is the only group I could do this with—the one that teaches, gives grace and support, and helps us grow together. We’re seeing mobilizations globally and nationally—marches, strikes, flotillas, and more. How do you see this festival in conversation with those acts of solidarity? Oliver: Shout out to Gabriel and Maher for the lineup ideas—that’s where intentional solidarity shows up. Who we invited and why had everything to do with the messaging artists already live in their art and movement work. The lineup alone speaks to how we aim to operate in solidarity. Palestine is at the center of why we came together, but we’re also clear that we’re resisting larger structures. We want folks to leave with a deeper analysis of what we’re fighting and how. As an artist and cultural worker, I think about music, poetry, visual art—even the food we choose—as ways to bring us back to each other. Actions like the flotilla aim to break a siege, meet basic needs, and galvanize organized response to empire’s violence. The festival does parallel work: supporting HEAL [Palestine]’s care for children who’ve lost limbs; the Transgender Law Center’s protection of our trans siblings; La Resistencia’s frontline organizing at the Northwest Detention Center. These are tangible, often hyper-local ways to show up. Choosing beneficiaries like Water Protectors, the Black Panther Party, and BLM Washington reflects that our struggles are interconnected. Palestinians benefit from La Resistencia’s work; Black queer folks benefit from the Transgender Law Center and the Panthers. We’re showing up in multifaceted ways—care, organizing, resistance—and that starts on stage. No matter who you hear, you’ll get that message. Deepening our analysis deepens our resistance and commitment. I hope people leave with their cup filled and a fire to act. Peterson-Burge: I remind myself: Showing up in the streets is as important as showing up for cultural preservation, togetherness, breaking bread, teaching dances, eating the foods we’ve missed. All of it matters so we don’t lose ourselves while we fight for everyone. Creating space to preserve ourselves and our cultures is powerful, transformative, revolutionary—and necessary. Joudi: At the core, these movements are the same: people from all walks of life standing against oppression. Forty-plus countries supporting a flotilla is all of us understanding we must stand for all of us. That’s what we embody—through many avenues. Cultural preservation is huge. Speaking as a Palestinian, erasure includes stealing our culture—claiming hummus, rewriting our history. Supporting Palestinians isn’t only about Gaza and the West Bank—there’s immediate need, yes, but Palestine lives forever by preserving our culture. That’s true for every community represented here. Preserving who we are is how we win. For folks new to this movement or who didn’t attend last year, what do you want them to take away after attending? Joudi: For my community: the need for collectiveness. I’ve shouted for Palestine my whole life, and I “got” interconnectedness—Ferguson in 2016—but I hadn’t truly connected the dots on intersectionality and riding for each other. Our heroes have been telling us: Leila Khaled said 50 years ago there is only one oppression. The Panthers visited Philistine and stood with Palestine. Kids in Gaza held “I stand with Ferguson” signs. Our movements fall apart when we’re convinced to battle each other for attention. I want folks to understand it all needs to be discussed and fought for at the same time—it’s the same fucking move. The music, speakers, vendors are dope—we’ll feel good—but I need everyone to leave knowing we’re all connected against them. If you’re with them, you’re not with us. If you’re with us, you’re with all of us. Teodros: As a musician, I want artists to walk away less afraid and less alone in speaking up for Palestine. Somehow calling a genocide a genocide is still controversial. We intentionally booked people already making bold stands for humanity. I want that—and collective liberation—to become the norm. Culture helps by modeling it and building our own stages when others won’t book this—we have to do it ourselves. Also, let’s name it: Live Nation’s second-largest shareholder is BlackRock; Ticketmaster is part of that ecosystem—there are corporate interests in silencing artists. We can’t let them dictate culture. We do that—community, people, artists. Oliver: It would be easy to assume we had every resource from day one. We didn’t. We showed up finding resources as we went. You can have a big vision and then call your homies and make it happen—that’s how this happened. If we want more control, we have to build it. Our communities have long built institutions outside government—mutual aid networks, survival structures—out of brilliance and necessity. I hope folks leave thinking: We have the capacity to build our own structures for self-governance. Many hands make light work. And I hope the Black community sees our trans siblings as central to Black struggle; that we see immigrants’ fights against ICE and Indigenous fights for resources as ours too. There is no single-issue struggle. We can build what we need, together. Peterson-Burge: I want everyone to leave feeling, “I really needed that—and I got it.” To have been in space with our people and felt joy. And then I want folks to plug into an organizing home—consistently. If you don’t have one, find one: a book list, political education classes, places to learn our intertwined histories. I want cross-pollination—Palestinian homies connecting with the Black Panther Party; Black queer siblings pulling up with La Resistencia. Also, as a fundraising person, sustaining our movements means mobilizing the masses to support them. The festival is a vessel to move resources to under-resourced movements so our people can keep doing the work. If we can give a small grassroots org two more months of budget to keep stopping detentions, that matters. If five more people give $10 so they can buy water for volunteers, that matters. Our beneficiaries span different movement spheres to reach widely, rooted in intersectionality and collective struggle. I hope folks take action. Is there a moment from the past year of putting this together that represents the hope of what this festival means? Teodros: From an artist’s perspective: seeing artists meet through the festival and then collaborate. Even before the first one, watching Desirée Dawson—a Black woman in Canada—covering Samer, a young Palestinian artist’s, song, and sharing it online. Seeing Bambu and the Neighborhood Kids meet at the festival and then collaborate on music and a series of events. Maher was involved in events around the country with lineups that mirrored ours. Bringing folks together and watching them keep working—that’s meaningful. A post shared by Bambu DePistola (@bambudepistola) Joudi: Those moments were heartwarming. Where it really clicked for me—this isn’t just an event, it’s moving a movement forward—was in the last week or so. Vendors reaching out: “I missed the deadline, but I need to be there.” Artists asking to get on the lineup. Those are hard conversations—we want to keep it fresh and platform new voices—but the community’s feedback at every level has been powerful. Even on logistics calls—like with the video wall folks—people who weren’t involved last year were hyped because of the cause. Last year, stage staff told us how grateful they were to work the festival—we’re feeling that again. Stepping outside myself, I feel grateful and blessed to help make this happen, no matter how hard the work is, knowing what it means to people and what it will do for the community. Oliver: Two moments. First: Last year, a homie brought his elementary-aged son. I was stage-managing and saw them dancing together during Native Guns’ set. Afterward, he told me it was a transformative moment—passing down the cultural work of artists who politicized him, and watching his son be politicized by the same art, in joy. That’s joy as resistance—creating space to pass down resistance through art. Second: During Whodinii’s set, the Palestinian community—and comrades—broke into a big circle dance. Organizers and volunteers literally lost themselves in that moment, because they knew we built a space where we care for each other. You didn’t need your head on a swivel like at a protest. It was unbridled, embodied resistance. That’s what the festival is about—and the world I hope we get. Peterson-Burge: I was going to name that dance moment too—seeing Palestinians and other Arab folks teaching others how to do it was beautiful. Two other (selfish) moments for me: walking into the grounds that morning and seeing the banner and stage set with last year’s image—realizing, “We did that.” I had to walk off and cry. It represented weeks of late nights, fundraising, calls, crying, arguing—the whole thing—becoming real. Then at the end, bringing all the organizers onstage, arms around each other, taking a deep breath: “Dang, we did that.” Most of us didn’t know each other closely before last year—we put that first festival together in six to eight weeks. Now these people are my family. They’re coming to my wedding. That kind of relational, transformational organizing—where I can have hard conversations and be heard—was what I needed. It’s a huge reason I’m doing this again. If my people are doing something, I’m showing up—tired or not—because I know they’ll show up for me.

Title: BlackRock’s Rick Rieder Climbs Ranks of Fed Chair Contenders

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder is rising up the list of contenders to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve after Jerome Powell’s term expires in May, according to an administration official. In a wide-ranging interview that lasted for two hours on Friday in New York, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Rieder discussed monetary policy, the Fed’s organizational structure and regulatory policy, the person said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting. Bessent has so far interviewed four of the 11 candidates publicly named as under consideration for the top central bank job, the official said, emphasizing that the process is ongoing. One or two more names will likely be added to that list, according to the person. Rieder is one of the most senior executives at BlackRock, overseeing the firm’s fixed income business. He joined the company in 2009, following nearly two decades at Lehman Brothers Inc. A representative for BlackRock had no immediate comment. Bessent was impressed with Rieder’s long career in markets running large groups and his deep understanding of micro- and macro-contributors to the economy, according to someone familiar with the Treasury secretary’s thinking. Rieder would bring a calm demeanor and in-depth knowledge of financial firms outside the banking system if he becomes Fed chair, the person said. Bessent appreciates Rieder’s ability to use forward-looking frameworks to assess the economy, rather than relying on backward-looking data, the person said. The Treasury chief was impressed by a similar intuitiveness after a conversation with Fed Governor Christopher Waller over the summer. President Donald Trump has been frustrated with Powell’s dependence on data to guide the Fed’s next moves, giving him the nickname “Too Late.” Two senior staffers, one who is a macro-economist and another with regulatory and markets expertise, were in the room for Bessent’s meeting with Rieder. Trump last week said that his top candidates for Fed chair include Waller, former Fed official Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council. However, he has deputized Bessent to run a comprehensive search process. The Treasury chief has said that he will interview all the contenders and offer Trump a shortlist of three to four to consider later this fall. --With assistance from Silla Brush.

Title: BlackRock Weighs Tokenized ETFs Following Bitcoin Fund Surge

BlackRock is moving deeper into tokenized funds, and the moves are starting to look like a bid to bring traditional ETFs onto blockchains. Reports have disclosed that the firm’s tokenized money market product, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund or BUIDL, is already live on the Ethereum network and works with firms such as Securitize and BNY Mellon for transfer agent and custody roles. According to filings and industry reports, the BUIDL fund is backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Transfer agent duties are being handled by Securitize while custody services are provided by BNY Mellon. Other infrastructure providers named in reports include Fireblocks, BitGo, Coinbase and Anchorage Digital. The fund pays yields to token holders on a daily basis using blockchain rails, and it is being positioned as a bridge between classic cash-like instruments and programmable token holdings. JUST IN: BlackRock plans to tokenize ETFs following success with $BTC fund. pic.twitter.com/yQD0E4VjpX — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) September 11, 2025 Executives have been quoted as saying tokenization could scale far beyond a single fund. Reports have put a potential addressable market figure as high as $10 trillion if a broad array of assets and ETFs are moved on-chain over time. Industry trackers also show that the total value locked in tokenized real-world assets passed $10 billion in recent months, a sign that the market is no longer purely experimental. BlackRock’s activity has prompted comparisons with other large asset managers, such as Franklin Templeton, which have also launched tokenized offerings. Proponents say tokenized ETFs could allow fractional ownership and round-the-clock transferability, and they could speed settlement in some cases. Reports say tokenization may also boost transparency since ownership records can be viewed directly on the chain. At the same time, uncertainty remains over how tokenized ETF shares will interact with existing market structures such as APs and market makers, and whether on-chain trading will be treated the same as exchange trading under US securities rules. Regulators, custodians and auditors face hard choices about legal rights, disclosure and investor protections for tokenized securities. On the basis of sector coverage, firms continue to sort out custody architectures and legal wrappers that provide enforceable claims on the underlying assets to token holders. Various jurisdictions might draw different conclusions, which would impede cross-border adoption or confine rollouts to individual markets. BlackRock’s investigation into tokenized ETFs is a follow-up on the success of its Bitcoin fund, already attracting robust inflows and market interest. The firm’s success in that department is now generating speculation that its next move will be to take pieces of its multi-trillion-dollar ETF business on-chain. Should the transition occur, it would represent one of the biggest steps so far by a global asset manager towards investment products based on blockchain.

Title: When You May Want To Add Guaranteed Income To Your Financial Picture

ByCicely Jones , Contributor. Due to many investors’ uncertainty about today’s market, I’ve seen many people opt to move entirely to cash and take investing off the table, but I’ve also had many investors approach me with questions about how to protect their investments and guarantee income. At the end of the day, the right investment for you entirely depends on your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and alternative options you are considering. Here is information on how guaranteed income may fit into your financial picture. When investors are fearful, I often see them do one of a few things: If your asset allocation is well-diversified and consistent with your risk tolerance and you can remain disciplined, most of the best advice indicates that if you can stand it, to go with the first option. Moving toward cash and cash alternatives in the moment can feel satisfying in the moment but will ultimately diminish your purchasing power and reduce your lifetime income potential. Making speculative bets can easily result in losing your entire portfolio. I recently asked an investor how he landed on his investment portfolio because it did not appear to be following a cohesive strategy, and it was losing badly to every benchmark. He responded, “Youtubers and vibes.” While that has some entertainment value, I don’t recommend that sort of strategy for anyone who wants to reach a financial goal like retirement. There are several types of annuities and structured products, but I’d like to focus on indexed annuities and variable annuities because they can solve for longevity risk, inflation risk, volatility risk, interest rate risk, and taxation risk for the right investor. A variable annuity is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. In essence, an annuity is a contractual agreement in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agree to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. Typically, variable annuities have mortality and expense charges, account fees, investment management fees and administration fees. In addition, annuity policies have exclusions and limitations, early withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and, if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% federal income tax penalty. Variable annuities are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal. An indexed annuity is a type of insurance contract that pays an interest rate based on the performance of a market index. It differs from a fixed annuity, which pays a fixed rate of interest, and a variable annuity, which bases its interest rate on a portfolio of investment options chosen by the annuity owner. Indexed annuities are sometimes referred to as equity-indexed or fixed-indexed annuities. One of the biggest questions when determining your retirement income need is how long you might live. According to Flowing Data, using information from the Social Security Administration, a female 40-year-old has: Essentially, the odds are highly in your favor of making it past age 80. This can present a problem when you try to make your money stretch potentially over 40 years. Because annuities are designed to pay out for someone’s entire life, regardless of what happens in the market, this can be particularly attractive to those with a family history of longevity. According to a 2024 BlackRock study, 97% of annuity owners say their annuities cause them decreased stress about running out of money. Over the last 100 years, inflation has averaged about 3% per year. That means that every year, to live the same lifestyle, your cost will go up. Let’s say your fixed expenses are $2,000 per month today. In 10 years, assuming 3% inflation, that monthly expense would be almost $2,700 per month. If you are considering sitting in cash, you will be losing purchasing power each year. While some annuities just pay a fixed amount every year, others can grow your payment amount each year through some combination of market returns or a guaranteed roll-up. When you are still in your accumulation phase without a thought of near-term withdrawals, you may be able to easily handle portfolio volatility. However, when you end up needing distributions, volatility can be a serious problem. Let’s go through two examples: Investor A has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Investor B has a portfolio value of $1,000,000 and an income need of $50,000 per year: Even though they started with the exact same amount, needed the exact same income, and had the exact same average return in two years, Investor B is in a significantly worse position because they started with a negative year instead of a positive one. If you take extend these small differences out 40 years, Investor B is more likely to run out of money than Investor A if they start in a worse market but ultimately achieve the same average return. Guaranteed income products attempt to eliminate that risk of timing issues leading to depletion of retirement savings. In retirement, I often see investors turning to money market funds, CDs, and fixed income investments. All of these are subject to interest rate risk. In the not-too-distant past, investors were getting between 0-2% on these types of investments, not even keeping up with inflation. Annuities are designed to provide some stability and predictability with guaranteed rates, making retirees less susceptible to interest rate risk. In nonretirement accounts, guaranteed income products offer tax-deferral during the accumulation phase. This means that unlike in brokerage accounts where you pay taxes every year on interest, dividends, and rebalancing, you will only pay taxes on the growth when you distribute funds. There is a good reason that annuities of the past have had negative associations. Not all guaranteed income products are created equal and it’s essential to speak with a qualified financial professional, about your goals and if a guaranteed income product is the right fit for a piece of your financial picture. In today's uncertain market, adding guaranteed income product offerings like annuities can address risks such as longevity, inflation, volatility, interest rates, and taxes. However, it's crucial to consult with a financial professional to ensure these products align with your unique goals and circumstances, enhancing your financial security and future planning.
