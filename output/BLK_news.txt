Open Semantic Interchange looks to change things for the better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. In recognition of the rise of agentic AI and the shift away from traditional dashboards and reports, Salesforce and Snowflake have teamed up with BlackRock, dbt Labs and RelationalAI to change things for the better when it comes to collaboration. Together, the group is launching Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), which Snowflake describes as a vendor-neutral framework that allows different platforms to talk to one another in the same language. The launch of OSI comes as companies struggle with vendor lock-ins, which create silos and limit the potential of AI tools. “With the Open Semantic Interchange initiative, we are proud to be leading the charge alongside our partners to solve a foundational challenge for AI – the lack of a common semantic standard,” Snowflake EVP of Product Christian Kleinerman commented. The initiative’s key goals are to improve interoperability, reduce complexity and boost AI adoption “by standardizing how semantics are defined and exchanged.” It’s also a futureproofing initiative in more ways than one – Salesforce cited Accenture research predicting AI agents will be the primary users of enterprise software by 2030, ahead of humans. “These new intelligent workers are only as effective as the data they can access and understand,” Tableau Chief Product Officer Southard Jones explained. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! To support bi-directional metadata exchange, the OSI standardizes data metrics, dimensions, hierarchies and relationships. Snowflake highlighted the five core principles of OSI: standardization (common language and structure); interoperability (easy exchange between tools); extensibility (adaptable to evolving needs); open source (collaborative development); and domain-specific models (to combine data from various sources). Jones likened the Open Semantic Interchange to the Rosetta Stone for business data: “By co-leading the Open Semantic Interchange with Snowflake and our partners, we’re building the foundation every AI agent and BI application needs: a common semantic framework that preserves meaning across platforms.” With several years’ experience freelancing in tech and automotive circles, Craig’s specific interests lie in technology that is designed to better our lives, including AI and ML, productivity aids, and smart fitness.

Title: The 20 financial firms that could be hardest hit from Trump's new H-1B fee — from Goldman Sachs to Citi
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-fees-rule-change-financial-industry-jobs-jpmorgan-goldman-2025-9

Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas. Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, "caught everyone off guard," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week. In order to visualize the potential impact on the financial industry, Business Insider turned to publicly available data from the Department of Labor and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The data covers H-1B application data for the first three quarters of the government fiscal year 2025, as well as the less-common H-1B1 and E-3 visas, from October of 2024 to the end of June this year. We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands. The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Major banks like Chase and Goldman Sachs dominate the list alongside major payments companies like American Express. Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and research and ratings agency Moody's, help to round it out. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI. Certified applications: 2,440 Employees worldwide: 317,160 as of the second quarter of 2025 The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. The bank also filed visa applications for the firm's main business lines, such as an investment banking managing director. Certified applications: 1,575 Employees worldwide: Over 78,000 per its website Fidelity submitted a wide range of applications for technical roles, with 40 certified applications for full-stack engineering directors and 125 for full-stack engineering principals. Non-technical roles included a director of marketing. Certified applications: 1,280 Employees worldwide: 45,900 as of the second quarter of 2025 Not all of Goldman Sachs' certified applications specified the role, focusing instead on the level of hire, such as an associate. The data, however, does show a wide range of technologist hires and financial hires, including many vice president-level banking roles. Certified applications: 921 Employees worldwide: 75,100 as of the end of 2024 American Express's certified applications were largely for technologist roles, with more than 125 for"engineer" roles. Business Insider also found applications for non-technical roles, including director-level applications for risk management, communications, and controller. Certified applications: 874 Employees worldwide: 229,000 as of the end of 2024 Citi's certified applications also largely focused on technology roles, including more than 150 certified applications for "Application Development Technical Lead Analyst" roles. Certified applications: 871 Employees worldwide: 76,500 as of the second quarter of 2025 Like others on this list, Capital One's certified applications largely focused on technology and data roles. The data showed hundreds of applications for data science and analysis roles, as well as some less technical roles like "business manager." Certified applications: 770 Employees worldwide: 31,600 as of the end of 2024 Visa is yet another company largely focused on tech and data hires. Some non-technical roles include compensation business analysts, senior financial analysts, and managers. Certified applications: 718 Employees worldwide: 213,000 as of the second quarter of 2025 Bank of America also focused its applications on tech hiring. Their most common role on the list, a vice president-level software engineer III, could be found on over 100 applications. Certified applications: 673 Employees worldwide: 80,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors. Certified applications: 624 Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing. Certified applications: 457 Employees worldwide: 92,900 as of the end of 2024 The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Some front-office hires included an equities derivatives trader and an equities "exotic" trader. Certified applications: 434 Employees worldwide: 32,600 per the firm's website Charles Schwab is also using H-1B visa to hire tech talent, with the data showing nearly 50 software development and engineering senior manager roles and nearly 100 software development and engineering manager hires. We were unable to find a single role that didn't appear to be related to technology. Certified applications: 391 Employees worldwide: 217,000 at the end of 2024 Wells Fargo joins the ranks of financial firms largely focused on technological hires in its H-1B visa applications. The data also showed certified applications for roles like lead securities trader and strategy and planning director. Certified applications: 339 Employees worldwide: 110,323 as of the end of 2024 UBS had certified applications for a slew of tech and financial roles. On the financial side, it has applied for roles like investment banking analyst and associate, the entry-level role to a banking career, as well as an associate director of global markets FX trading. Certified applications: 294 Employees worldwide: Approximately 22,000 per the firm's website. Like Morgan Stanley, BlackRock only provides the level of roles hired. The bulk of roles culled by Business Insider were at the associate or vice president level, though there are also more than 20 director-level applications. Certified applications: 213 Employees worldwide: Approximately 53,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 State Street's visa applications were largely focused on technology hires, though financial roles were also on the menu. Non-financial roles included applications for a head of internal liquidity stress testing in treasury and a global head of liquidity risk oversight. Certified applications: 209 Employees worldwide: Approximately 20,000 per the firm's website as of the end of 2024 A large chunk of Vanguard's applications were for application engineering and other technical roles. The asset management firm also had applications for a fixed-income trader, a head of wealth management and advice, and a head of fraud, strategy, and analytics. Certified applications: 199 Employees worldwide: 15,838 at the end of 2024 The ratings and research powerhouse joins the rest on the list with a focus on technologists. Senior software engineers and staff software engineers lead the way in certified applications. Some non-technical applications included a director-level sales manager, a credit associate, and a commercial real estate researcher. Certified applications: 185 Employees worldwide: 38,335 as of the end of 2024 Software engineering roles made up roughly half of Truist's applications reviewed by Business Insider. Most other roles were tech-focused, such as a senior data analyst in liquidity and regulatory reporting, though there were some rare non-tech roles, such as Treasury market and liquidity risk officer. Certified applications: 144 Employees worldwide: 21,000 as of the end of 2024 Discover joins the ranks of others on this list with roughly 100 applications mentioning data science. Other interesting technical roles included a lead robotic process automation analyst. Jump to

Title: Ripple, Securitize Bring RLUSD to BlackRock and VanEck Tokenized Funds
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/24/ripple-securitize-bring-rlusd-to-blackrock-and-vaneck-tokenized-funds
Time Published: 2025-09-24T08:09:42Z
Full Content:
Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is being integrated into tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock and VanEck, giving holders of the products a direct redemption path into on-chain liquidity. Through a new smart contract on Securitize’s platform, investors in BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL funds can now swap their shares for RLUSD on demand, creating what Ripple calls a 24/7 stablecoin off-ramp for tokenized treasuries. The move positions RLUSD as a settlement layer for real-world assets (RWA) while broadening its institutional footprint. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, said in a prepared statement thathe tie-up “is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” framing RLUSD as regulatory-compliant and enterprise-grade. RLUSD — backed 1:1 with liquid reserves and issued under a New York DFS trust charter — has climbed past $700 million in circulation since launching last year. Ripple has been pushing its use in cross-border payments and DeFi pools, while now anchoring it to institutional RWA platforms. The Securitize tie-in also sets up RLUSD for deployment on the XRP Ledger, giving Ripple a dual push of a regulatory-compliant stablecoin issuance on one side, and DeFi-facing usability on the other.

Title: Miriam Lord: Maria Steen, opponent of marriage equality and abortion, championed as a symbol of choice
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/oireachtas/2025/09/24/maria-steen-opponent-of-marriage-equality-and-abortion-championed-as-a-symbol-of-choice/
Time Published: 2025-09-24T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
It was a busy morning for the men of Independent Ireland. The fab four woke, heads spinning, after a private meeting the previous night with Maria Steen of the Iona Institute – a stylish last-minute entrant into the narrowing race to secure a place on the presidential election ticket. This was high-stakes, highwire stuff. The media was on full alert. Independent Ireland issued a communique first thing on Tuesday saying it would be holding a press call on the Leinster House Plinth at 12.15pm to announce its decision on the nomination. Could things get any more exciting? Well, yes. Because another communique had landed, this time from the Healy-Rae camp. The vote of the Kilgarvan jury was in. Danny himself would be in the vicinity of the Plinth at midday to announce the unanimous result of his personal ruminations on the same issue. In fact, he would be available for publicity purposes from the front door all the way down to the pavement outside the Kildare Street gates. At the appointed time, the three Indyeye members did the requisite business-like strut to the microphones (Michael Fitzmaurice was missing) to declare the party is backing Steen. Deputy Fitzmaurice was at the previous evening’s hush-hush consultation with the Catholic think-tank’s star performer “Royal Ascot meets Ballinrobe Races,” was how one observer summed up the freshly-forged alliance between the defenders of rural Ireland and the Ballsbridge born, Blackrock resident, Maria. Both sides from very leafy surrounds. Danny rather ruined the exclusive element of this momentous announcement by galumphing in with one of his own. Thrilled with himself. Maria was the only woman for him. “She’s a breath of fresh air,” he said, adding his name to her growing list of nominees. Growing, but still shy of the required 20 signatures to get on the ballot paper as the day wore on. She needs those names in the bag by midday on Wednesday to make the cut. Mother-of-five Maria, who homeschools her children, is a skilled television performer. Extremely conservative on social matters, she rose to national prominence during the referendums on marriage equality and repealing the Eighth amendment on abortion with her uncompromising opposition to both measures. She was on the winning side, though, during last year’s referendums on family and care, when voters rejected the Government’s muddled constitutional questions on expanding the concept of family. The fab four appealed to other Independent TDs and Senators to ‘facilitate democracy’ and get Maria over the line She certainly charmed Independent Ireland during their meeting on Monday night. Cork North-Central TD Ken O’Flynn, who married his husband Francisco in Seville in 2022, said he was supporting Maria’s bid having been assured by her that she would work with the LGBTQ community during her presidency. His colleague Richard O’Donoghue, from Limerick County, told journalists that his son is gay but he was reassured by Maria’s respectful responses during their meeting. Independent Ireland put out a statement explaining the decision in more detail. “We were impressed by her honesty, her candour and her ability to clearly communicate her views and vision for the presidency. We were particularly struck by her determination to be a genuine voice for the people of Ireland who feel ignored and unrepresented by the political establishment.” Backing her would ensure voters “are given a real choice”. The fab four appealed to other Independent TDs and Senators to “facilitate democracy” and get Maria over the line. And they finished with a stupendously ironic last line, declaring she “deserves the opportunity to present her case and the people of Ireland deserve the right to choose”. Not to be confused with a woman’s right to choose, an opportunity which Maria Steen refused to countenance during the referendum on abortion, which was carried by a landslide vote. [ Maria Steen: The Iona Institute barrister hoping to become president of IrelandOpens in new window ] “We are true democrats,” she said outside Leinster House at the start of her charm offensive which was ongoing throughout the day, much of the time with Senator Rónán Mullen by her side. Meanwhile, the work of Independent Ireland carried on. So much to do. So much of it in the public eye. A politician has to look his best during these times. So, from a statement with jaw-dropping last line to a question with an arresting opening line. Heads swivelled when party leader Michael Collins, during the Order of Business in the Dáil, began his question thus: “Independent Ireland met with the Irish Hairdressers Federation today...” It was the natural thing to do. But upon closer inspection, his hair didn’t look any different. But there will be a lot of pressure on hairdressers during the coming weeks of the campaign. Good idea for Michael and the boys to get in there first. But no. Along with giving Maria their blessing, they also wanted to highlight the case of the hairdressing industry which is in a bad way. “There is a stark future for many hair salons if they do not get a VAT reduction to 9 per cent in January. Hair salons employ thousands of people and apprentices in this country. Suppliers are now refusing to credit many of these salons. There is a huge crisis.” Meanwhile, also back in Leinster House following his big nomination announcement, Danny Healy-Rae looked mightily pleased with himself, even sending a beaming smile up to the press gallery in between looking at his mobile phone. Perhaps it was because the old band was back together again, if only for a one-off gig. Once a member of the Roaring Independents, Danny and his brother Michael left to support the Government in return for a sweetheart deal for Kerry. Last week in the Dáil, Danny Healy-Rae suggested autism may be caused by a lack of vitamins Now a Minister of State, Michael Healy-Rae has publicly thrown his support behind Fine Gael’s Heather Humphreys even though he signed Steen’s papers. But one gets the impression that Danny’s declaration is more in tune with the mood of the Healy-Rae organisation. But wait. There might have been another reason for his happy demeanour. While the Indyeyes were communing with Maria on Monday night, Donald Trump was over in Washington about to make bizarre and unproven statements connecting autism to pregnant women taking paracetamol. Last week in the Dáil, Danny Healy-Rae suggested autism may be caused by a lack of vitamins. His comment was widely condemned. Maybe he has a direct line to US health secretary Robert F Kennedy jnr, who was standing behind the US president when he made his comments, which have also been widely condemned. Meanwhile, Maria continued on her hunt for those elusive final nominations. Along the trail were some who might have been expected to lend support. Among them, Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell. But by teatime, having met the very charming and persuasive prospective candidate – “a very fine lady” – he thought long and hard and resisted her blandishments for the sake of Ireland. Senator Craughwell was not for turning. Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day. Every Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday when the Dáil sits © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Integrated As an Off-Ramp For BlackRock And VanEck Tokenized Funds

Ripple, an enterprise-focused blockchain service closely tied to the XRP Ledger, said on Tuesday that its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), has been added to Securitize’s platform, enabling users to exchange shares in tokenized money market funds by major crypto investment firms BlackRock and VanEck for the U.S. dollar-pegged token. Ripple and Securitize debuted a smart contract allowing holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s Treasury Fund (VBILL) to swap their tokenized shares for the RLUSD. The smart contract enables BUIDL and VBILL investors to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD at any time, facilitating additional on-chain transactions. “Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo stated. The move comes as Securitize seeks to expand the functionality of the XRP Ledger, according to the press release. This marks the first integration of RLUSD into Securitize’s offerings, with “additional use cases and assets planned.” Ripple rolled out the RLUSD stablecoin on the XRPL and Ethereum blockchains in December 2024. While it’s much smaller than Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, RLUSD has grown to a market cap of nearly $740 million within the past year, becoming the eighth-largest stablecoin in the industry. Ripple’s senior VP of stablecoins, Jack McDonald, described the integration in Securitize’s platform as a “natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” adding: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Company Charter, and has been greenlighted by some global authorities for asset tokenization. In June, the Dubai Financial Services Authority approved RLUSD support in the Dubai Land Department’s real estate tokenization initiative. Additionally, Singapore’s DBS Bank last week unveiled a collaboration with $1.6 trillion financial giant Franklin Templeton and Ripple to offer new trading and lending solutions using tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin. The integration of RLUSD for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds comes as total tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Securitize surpass $4 billion.

Title: BlackRock’s $2 billion BUIDL fund may soon expand to XRP Ledger

RLUSD’s rapid growth showcases its potential as a stable exchange tool for institutional tokenized funds like BlackRock's BUIDL. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenization platform Securitize is looking to integrate with the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a step that could bring BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) directly onto the blockchain network, according to a Sept. 23 statement. This impending move signals a deepening link between institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure, while also expanding XRPL’s presence in the real-world asset (RWA) sector. In recent months, XRPL has attracted multiple institutional adopters such as Guggenheim, VERT, and Dubai Land Registry. These additions have pushed the ledger into the top ten blockchains for RWA activity, underlining its growing relevance in capital markets. Ripple has reinforced this momentum by publishing a roadmap that positions XRPL, along with native assets XRP and RLUSD, as infrastructure for stablecoin payments, collateralized lending, and broader institutional use cases. Against this backdrop, the possible arrival of the $2 billion BUIDL fund on XRPL would serve as a milestone, given its status as the industry’s largest tokenized money market fund. As part of the collaboration, Ripple and Securitize are rolling out a smart contract integration that embeds RLUSD into the tokenization platform. The contract will allow investors to exchange shares in tokenized funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL for RLUSD 24/7. The integration is designed to enhance liquidity and offer investors a seamless way to move between tokenized money market funds and on-chain stable assets. While RLUSD for BUIDL is already live, VBILL support is expected to follow shortly. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, said the collaboration highlights RLUSD’s accelerating institutional adoption, noting that: “Last week we announced DBS and Franklin Templeton using $RLUSD as a liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases. This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds.” According to CryptoSlate data, RLUSD is among the fastest-growing stablecoins, now commanding a market capitalization of $741.4 million. Its integration into leading tokenized funds positions it as a core player in the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Ethereum slides 20% – So why did whales just bet $1B on a rebound?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-slides-20-so-why-did-whales-just-bet-1b-on-a-rebound/

ETF exits hit Ethereum hard, but whale accumulation hinted at resilience. ETF outflows reached $76 million, with BlackRock selling $15.1 million ETH and market makers repositioning aggressively on Binance. A whale opened a $1 billion long, ETH volume hit $40.5 billion, and analysts flagged chop before a potential Q4 rally. Ethereum [ETH] took the biggest hit in the recent market downturn and slipped closer to $4,000 after a 20% decline from its Q3 high of $4,900, with one week left in the quarter. Institutions have continued to dump their Ethereum holdings, flashing leveraged longs. However, such massive dips before have triggered rallies, with analysts predicting more chop before a rally. On-chain data showed that Binance was among the big institutions dumping Ethereum. According to data from Wimar.X, market makers such as Wintermute and Flow Traders were purchasing millions of ETH from Binance. Additionally, BlackRock sold about $15.1 million in ETH. Meanwhile, total Ethereum ETF outflows surpassed $76 million in 24 hours, led by Fidelity and Bitwise with $55 million combined. Source: Wimar/X That alignment reflected heavy institutional repositioning. In past cycles, similar flush-outs marked reversal points as year-end approached. Even so, what do analysts expect next? When writing, the price of Ethereum was approaching $4,000 from a high of $4,900. The reaction of ETH at the $4,000 level could determine its next trajectory. A dip below could take the price to $3,800 or lower, while a hold could start the rally. Analyst Michael van de Poppe predicted more sideways chop before any recovery, though he doubted ETH would fall as deep as $3,550. Source: Michael van de Poppe He noted that the 20-week MA was getting closer to the price. This indicated that compression was building up, a signal that price was preparing a move. On top of that, he framed the 20% dip as a key accumulation zone—an idea whales seemed to back. In the last 24 hours, a whale opened a 237K ETH long worth roughly $1 billion on Kraken. Spot data reinforced bullish flows. Ethereum’s trading volume hit $40.5 billion, surpassing Bitcoin by $7 billion. Source: Coinalyze Lastly, the price action appeared to be repeating 2017 and 2020 patterns per CoinGlass data. In these years, Ethereum gained in the second, third, and fourth quarters. With a similar pattern in play, ETH could extend its gains into the last quarter of the year.

Title: Fintech Giant Revolut Unveils $13 Billion Bet To Become The First Truly Global Bank
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertolsen-1/2025/09/23/fintech-giant-revolut-unveils-13-billion-bet-to-become-the-first-truly-global-bank/

ByRobert Olsen, Contributor. Revolut is making its biggest push yet on the world stage, pledging £10 billion ($13 billion) to fuel a rapid expansion that aims to reach 100 countries and grow its customer base to 100 million by the end of the decade. Ambition has never been in short supply at Revolut. By the end of the decade, the fintech says it wants to be operating in 100 countries and serving 100 million customers. “We always wanted to be global from day one,” said Nik Storonsky, cofounder and CEO, at the company’s new headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf. “The vision is very simple: we want to be in 100 countries, and with 100 million" customers. That vision has already taken Revolut further than most fintech firms. From its early days, when work was primarily done at a Starbucks in Canary Wharf—before Storonsky and cofounder Vlad Yatsenko decamped to Level39, a co-working space for tech startups—the firm has grown into a financial giant. Today it serves more than 65 million customers in over 50 markets, and it now occupies four floors in the YY London tower. The company’s growth trajectory is just as impressive as its new office. Revolut expects to generate more than £4 billion in revenue this year, having posted a pretax profit of $1.4 billion in 2024—its fourth consecutive year in the black. Investors have taken notice: a secondary share sale now underway values the business at $75 billion, up from $45 billion just a year ago. The firm’s soaring valuation has turned both Storonsky and Yatsenko into billionaires. Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, attended the opening of the firm’s new headquarters on Tuesday and welcomed Revolut’s pledge to invest $4 billion in the U.K. and create 1,000 new jobs over the next five years. She noted that the move adds to a recent wave of investment from financial heavyweights including Blackstone, BlackRock, and PayPal, bringing the U.K.’s tally of fresh commitments to more than £110 billion. Revolut’s ambitions extend well beyond Britain. By mid-2027 it aims to reach 100 million customers, and by 2030 it plans to add more than 30 new markets to its global operations. In Europe, it is launching branches in Portugal and Belgium and preparing to apply for a French banking license. In Asia, it is preparing to launch in India and is seeking further licenses in Australia and New Zealand. The company has already established a global tech hub in the Philippines. The firm also has plans for Africa and the Middle East. Revolut will make its first push into Africa, beginning with South Africa. It will expand in the Middle East with the help of a newly granted in-principle payments license in the United Arab Emirates. Latin America is also in the firm’s sights: the company will open a bank in Mexico early next year before moving into Colombia and Argentina. For Storonsky, all of this fits into a mission that has been consistent since those early days in Canary Wharf. “Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers,” he said. “And our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that.”

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Securitize partners with Ripple to enable shareholders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized funds to exchange their shares for RLUSD stablecoin. BlackRock BUIDL and VanEck VBILL tokenized funds shareholders will now be allowed to exchange their shares for Ripple’s RLUSD, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin, in a new partnership between Securitize and Ripple. This new feature was announced on September 23 in a press release published on Securitize’s website. Securitize is the company behind BlackRock’s, VanEck’s, and other institutions’ tokenization activities, being a world leader in tokenizing real-world assets with over $4 billion AUM as of May 2025. Initially, the RLUSD exchange will only be available for BlackRock’s BUIDL, with VanEck’s VBILL integration planned for the “coming days.” “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, also commented on the partnership, saying it is “a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets.” The company is also integrating with the XRP Ledger, going beyond a simple RLUSD exchange feature. “Together, we’re delivering real-time settlement and programmable liquidity across a new class of compliant, on-chain investment products—bringing the full potential of blockchain to institutional finance,” Domingo added. BlackRock launched BUIDL in partnership with Securitize on March 20, 2024. The fund offers exposure to qualified investors to US Treasury, cash, and repurchase agreements, currently with over $2 billion AUM among 91 holders, according to data from RWA.xyz. BUIDL is available on seven blockchains: Ethereum ETH $4 043 24h volatility: 2.3% Market cap: $486.78 B Vol. 24h: $33.10 B , Solana SOL $207.1 24h volatility: 2.0% Market cap: $112.51 B Vol. 24h: $8.44 B , Avalanche AVAX $31.97 24h volatility: 5.1% Market cap: $13.51 B Vol. 24h: $1.30 B , Aptos APT $4.17 24h volatility: 2.7% Market cap: $2.93 B Vol. 24h: $463.49 M , Arbitrum ARB $0.42 24h volatility: 2.1% Market cap: $2.29 B Vol. 24h: $261.90 M , Polygon, and Optimism OP $0.67 24h volatility: 2.0% Market cap: $1.20 B Vol. 24h: $138.11 M . The fund distributes income daily, charges a management fee of 0.20-0.50%, and has seen monthly transfer volumes of around $425 million, underscoring its appeal for DeFi integrations and stable yield generation. BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund | Source: RWAxyz Building on this momentum, VanEck entered the tokenized fund space with its Treasury Fund, VBILL, launched on May 13, 2025, also in collaboration with Securitize. As VanEck’s inaugural tokenized offering, VBILL provides blockchain-based access to short-term US Treasuries, targeting qualified investors with a lower entry point of $100,000. VBILL currently has 14 holders and a $74 million AUM, available on four blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Chain BNB $999.0 24h volatility: 1.6% Market cap: $139.00 B Vol. 24h: $2.27 B , Solana, and Avalanche. VanEck Treasury Fund | Source: RWAxyz The recently added liquidity against RLUSD, promised to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, could increase the accessibility and demand for both tokenized products—boosting the market’s interest in these real-world asset tokens. Tokenization has become a popular topic on Wall Street and among institutional investors, with Nasdaq already moving to facilitate tokenized stock trading with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as Coinspeaker reported.

Title: Ripple and Securitize Launch 24/7 Off-Ramp for BlackRock Tokenized Fund

Written byShota Oba Edited byMohammad Shahid Ripple and Securitize announced a smart contract. It lets holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized Treasury funds redeem shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD). The feature creates a regulated off-ramp that works 24/7. It gives institutional investors instant settlement and programmable liquidity. BlackRock launched the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) in March 2024. It surpassed $1 billion in assets within its first year. VanEck introduced the Treasury Fund (VBILL) in May 2025 on Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Solana. Ripple said BUIDL redemptions are live, and VBILL will follow in the coming days. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, said the option to redeem shares for RLUSD is “a natural next step” in bridging traditional finance with crypto. Securitize framed the integration as RLUSD’s first use on its regulated platform. The platform manages more than $4 billion in tokenized assets under SEC oversight. Carlos Domingo, Securitize’s chief executive, said the deal enables “real-time settlement and programmable liquidity” across compliant products. Ripple chose BNY Mellon to hold RLUSD reserves. Issued under a New York Department of Financial Services trust charter, RLUSD is backed one-to-one by cash and Treasurys. Assets stay segregated and subject to attestations. Analysts note that pairing NYDFS oversight with SEC-linked platforms shows the growing overlap—and at times tension—between state and federal rules in the US. Very excited to share that @BlackRock’s $BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s $VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through @Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL.Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.… Brad Garlinghouse said redemptions now run on Ethereum, with XRP Ledger support expected “soon.” Ripple launched RLUSD in late 2024. Since then, the stablecoin has passed $700 million in market capitalization. It also joined Ripple’s cross-border payments network and gained traction in decentralized finance pools. Ripple partnered with DBS and Franklin Templeton in Singapore to add RLUSD to asset management. It expanded access in Africa to support remittances and payments. The firm also planned a 2026 launch in Japan with SBI under Financial Services Agency rules.

I’m your host, Jeff Barber, and today we’re speaking with someone who’s carved out a unique niche in the bike industry by going against the grain, from his brash and unconventional approach to bikes to his knack for creating one of a kind accessories miles from Mullet Cycles has been challenging industry norms. For years, he’s dedicated himself to perfecting the mixed wheel format for mountain bikes, and he’s also the creative force behind miles wide industries which offers clever rider focused accessories. Today we’ll talk about his path into the cycling world, why he’s sticking with mixed wheel setups and what’s next for his two companies. Thanks for joining me Miles. Miles 0:43Hey. Thanks for having me, sir. Jeff Barber 0:47Well, you you’ve had a pretty colorful and eclectic background before starting mullet cycles. Tell us a little bit about your previous career and how you made the leap into the bike industry. Miles 0:59I did like a mountain bike summer camp, and I was 13 and got altitude sickness, and had a blast, made a bunch of cool friends. Um, I’m from New York, so I was, I went out to Colorado for this camp, and I broke a bunch of stuff on my bike. And was like, I want to work at a bike shop so I can get this kind of stuff. Jeff Barber 1:28Were you living in the city at the time, New York City? Miles 1:31I was actually living just outside the city. So a lot of people don’t know Brooklyn Queens is on Long Island, and then you have Nassau County, Suffolk County, it’s a pretty big island, so I was actually on the island about 10 miles outside of Manhattan. Jeff Barber 1:53And there’s mountain bike trails on Long Island, but it’s not like the first place people think of when they think of mountain biking. Miles 2:01No, they, they definitely don’t. I was most more of escaped skater. You know, I’d wear the Janko jeans, and I would go to the Brooklyn banks and kind of hanging out with bad crowd. One of my friends, older brother, had a mountain bike, and my friend’s parents and my parents spoke, and they’re like, Yeah, you should send them off, you know, get them a mountain bike and send them off to camp. So because I was, I was kind of becoming a bad boy. So, yeah, that’s, I guess, you know, lucky for me for having that friend and having his older brother that that’s kind of like, you know, I was, I didn’t know what a mountain bike was. It that I knew what a BMX bike was so but yeah, there were trails out in Long Island. My first time mountain biking ever was in Colorado, in Silverton on this camp. So before that, it was like, at this, you know, small walking park behind my neighborhood. So I really didn’t even know what mountain bike it was until I got out there. When I got out there, I was like, Oh, my God. Jeff Barber 3:19Like, there’s mountains in mountain biking, Miles 3:22Yeah, exactly I was, you know, and that’s why I got altitude sickness, because I was at sea level my entire life, you know, and I didn’t want to be at the back of the pack, so I was just really pushing myself hard. So I ended up working at this bike shop called Bike Works in Greenville, Long Island and small bike shop, and he wouldn’t pay me because I was like, 13, but I was like, I’ll just work for parts. I’ll clean the shop. I just want to learn everything about bikes, how to work on my bike. And, I mean, kind of like, long story short, on that, and I ended up working there till I was, like 26 even when I started other companies on my own, it was just kind of became like a second dad to me, in a lot of ways, the owner, it would just be me and him in there. So, you know, I would just constantly pick his brain with stuff. And then I ended up kind of running the shop. And then when I started my companies, you know, yeah, I would work there, like on Sundays, just as a bit of therapy. So I really working at the shop. I never wanted to get into the bike industry. I just, I saw how competitive it was, plus we carried specialized in track, which is really rare. Um, he kind of got, like, grandfather, yeah. 90s. He opened up, I want to say, like in the late 70s, okay, early 80s. So he got those brands, like when they were, you know, kind of starting out. And, yeah, it was just there. There was so much good stuff out there, and it was just so competitive. And I just was like, well, you really can’t make money in this industry. Jeff Barber 5:27And, yeah, and so I know a little bit about your story. I mean, yeah, kind of fast forward through. And you know, you worked in jewelry design, you had some of your own companies. So how did you get like, back? Like, what brought you back to say, You know what, I’m gonna, like, start a bike company. How did, how did Mullet Cycles officially get its start? Miles 5:52Well, it again. It was kind of organic. While I was working at that shop, I had started a personal lubricant company, which, you know, ended up being very successful, and we had a customer come into the shop and asked, if you know her, that I made that product, and wanted to pick my brain about it, just like I got a product that I would like to make with you and that I had a bunch of kind of time on my hands because I had, like, a warehouse distributor, it was all pretty just up and up and running. I got into some major retailers such as CVS, with it. So what he had was he was on, like a race, a road bike race team, and they all use Ziploc bags in their bicycle jersey. And he was like, we should make a neoprene bag that has a bunch of compartments to hold all your tools, and we can stick that in our bike jersey. I was a mountain biker. Road biking was pretty dangerous in the metropolitan area. I would sometimes, yeah, you know, people a wife, a widow, would bring in a bike that I had worked on. So, you know, my husband got hit by a car. I don’t know what. I don’t want to see this anymore, you know, part it out and sell the parts, or whatever you want to do with it, you know, after, like, insurance and everything. So I wasn’t that into it, but he was a really cool guy. He actually worked for Blackstone or Blackrock at one of the big investment companies, BlackRock, yeah, one of the big Yep, he actually did their software and stuff for, I guess, trading. He tried to explain it to me that that my brain doesn’t work like that, but he was a really cool guy, like, you just look cool, and he had a swagger. And I was like, Yeah, you know, like, I wanted to pick his brain. And anyway, ended up making that. And, you know, I just kind of made it to make it. It was like a fun little project. I learned he before he started that he was doing clothes, so he knew how to sew. And so I would go over to his flat in Brooklyn and taught me how to sew, and I got materials in the garment district in Manhattan. And it was kind of like, you know, it was like this little side project that was just fun for me. I kind of got sick of New York. I moved to Asheville and Tyler Benedict, a bike groomer, did a review on this sticky pod, which I don’t know how he got his hands on one, because we’re just selling them through the bike shop. Jeff Barber 9:02No PR person reaching out. Miles 9:06No. And I we had, like, oh, he built a website, like a one page website, and, you know, I would maybe send out, like, five a month, uh, mostly in the northeast area. And so I opened up my paypal and it was just like, Dude, there’s like 15k in there, like overnight. And after just having like a few 100 in the sticky pod PayPal, and I was like, Holy crap, my my website got hacked or something. I ended up googling it was on bike. Rumor opened up my inbox so that there were like distributors in there that wanted to carry it, and all this stuff. At that point, I had sold my lubricant company, um. Um, so I was like, Okay, I’ll start making this stuff, you know, okay, I’ll and I had distributors asking me, what other products you make. So I started just developing a product line of products that I wanted but nobody else is making. So, like, I made the grips for brake levers. I made a shock stiction lube. I made, like, this bottle pod, which was an organizer for, like, it was just basically a bottle that had compartments in there, and you could put in your water bottle cage, because, again, my jersey. So I really didn’t use a sticky pod, like, I would just use it as, like a little thing in my car for stuff. Jeff Barber 10:46So a pencil case. Miles 10:48Right, a yellow pencil case. After Asheville, I moved to Colorado. I just wanted bigger mountains, and I always had a love for Colorado. After riding there, when I was in my ute, I would do that summer camp, like every year. So I ended up being like a counselor on that on that camp. And so I had experience all over the West Coast and like my teenage years, which is great. Okay, yeah, so when I moved to Colorado, I visited a bunch of bike shops and asked, you know, told them, hey, I’m in Colorado. These are some of my products. If you’d like, you can get them through like BTi, JBI, and it was also a way to make some new friends in the area. You know, some of the, some of the mechanics I want some riding buddies. One of the shops, Timberline cycles was a foes dealer, and I was my personal bike was a foes and I’d always been a big foes fan. And a foes dealer is really rare. So I wanted to, you know, talk to him about bikes and show him my stuff. He was closing his shop. I kept leaving voicemails. He ended up finally calling me back, and he was like, hey, you know, I’m closing up the shop, and, you know, I got your voicemails, you know, yeah, if you’d like to come in and talk about bikes, you know, sure, so we scheduled a day, got into talking, and he basically was, had dropped off his friends. He was the he basically came to Brent with this idea of a mixed wheel bike, Jeff Barber 12:45And who was the who was the owner of the shop? What was his name? Miles 12:48Mike Vidovich, okay, and he, before he opened that shop, he it was a dirt bike shop. So he carried Gas, gas. And before that, he managed one of the biggest bike shops in the springs, pro pro cycling. Jeff Barber 13:14Yeah. Miles 13:15So yeah, he ended up opening up a dirt bike shop Spain kind of had their recession after hours. This is like 2012 so he couldn’t get dirt bikes anymore. And his employees are like, Why don’t you just carry mountain bikes? Since you know mountain bikes very well, you have a Racetech suspension degree. You were the, you know, you would rebuild the shocks at your shop. And he was a great mechanic, and so he carried a bunch of different brands that had, like, all different suspension designs, basically. So he carried single pivot or DW. When he got the 275 wheel, which was like two or ended 2012 he still had some dirt bikes in his shop. And he was like, hmm, you know, this is kind of like the golden ratio. He had, like, he carried, like Ventana, and they had a 69 ER, so they had a 29 front 26 reader as well as Moots did as well. And he felt that the ratio was just too big a part. And he thought, like the 275 was kind of like the Goldilocks. So he started throwing those wheels on his 29 inch wheel bikes that he sold. And was like, well, and he had some really fast riders. He had one guy, Tucker, who won state championships downhill. He was like, well, there, I need to do things to the geometry in order to really get this correct. And so he contacted a couple of companies that he was carrying and say, Hey, would you be cool? Of maybe making a mixed real bike. And they all said, No, you know, it’s kind of like a fad. It’s been done before. And so he ended up reaching out to foes. Who would you carry? Carried single pivot? And he basically said, if you purchase like, 25 frames, yeah, I’ll do it for you. Okay, they kind of, you know, so Mike went out to Pasadena, which is where they were located at the time, and, you know, stayed with Brent and told him what he wanted. Worked it worked at the shop with him. Told him the geometry and stuff like that. Help pay. You know, Mike had to pay for, like the marketing. So he did a video, paid half the booth for inner bike in 2015 which is when they released it. And I was actually, I had a booth at that show under the miles of my my little trinkets product. So I had actually met like at that show, because I want to go to the foe’s booth. So the new mixer model, and I was like, to me, it just looked really ugly. And I had experience on the big hit back in the day when I used to race in the Norbu series, and they would come through ski platichill in New York, and I got hurt really bad on that, and the 24 inch wheel just had no right being on a downfall course, I Guess, got hung up and, like, launched like Superman, couple a couple of feet, and then boom, and I was concussed and broke a bunch of stuff. So anyway, so getting back to, you know, my kind of telling me, and now, and I told him that, he was like, Well, have you ever, you know, ridden one of these, you know, I know you’re a fan of this brand. And I was like, No. He was like, Well, why don’t you take one out and ride one? So he set one up for me, and I that day, I The shop was really close to Red Rock open space, so I just pedaled from the shop to the trails. And he told me to put my Strava on. And I really didn’t take it serious. I was just kind of riding the bike, and I ended up, Ko, I made, like, two sections, and, oh, wow, without really even trying. And I was like, This doesn’t make sense. And I ended up. So I went back to the shop and, like, I PR at every, every, every segment. I went back to the shop, and I was like, you know, something doesn’t make sense here. Can I take out again? And he was like, Sure. So I took it on section 16, which is more of an enduro trail, and I PR my climbing Kom, another segment, and my PRs were so much faster. And he’s like, you know, and I and he, when I went back to the shop again, I was like, Yeah, this is fast, man. It’s actually better. And he was just laughing. And he’s like, I told you, I told you, it’s the future. And I was like, How come nobody else is doing this? And he said, Well, you know, I called some companies, asked him to make them. They said it was gimmicky, and they’re also banned to race on. You can’t race on these on a mixed wheel bike. Jeff Barber 18:39Okay, yeah. Miles 18:41So you know, was like, Well, why don’t we make it basically, you, you know, understand the geometry. No one’s really doing this. You have Foes. And then I did some research. You had foes and you had light bill. It’s German company. They were the only two that offered them. And, you know, I was like, both of these bikes are pretty ugly. It just my opinion. Eye of the beholder. I was like, let’s make them. Jeff Barber 19:16Because Foes was, Foes was, like, a pretty small brand. Miles 19:19Back then. Yeah, still, still, you know, pretty small, yeah. Jeff Barber 19:24And they were making the bikes. Were they making them in the US? They were like, yeah. And as I recall, they were, they looked pretty, like basic, kind of, like, garage build, yes, Miles 19:34Yeah, yeah. You know, they have always kind of, like, some like, when I would ride it, they would, I would get made fun of. They’re like, You look like a photo riding that thing, yeah? And I would just be like, well, you know, made in the USA, and I don’t need, I just need a single pivot, you know, you need all these linkages, yeah? And you’re not even as fast as me, so, ah. But, yeah, you know, like, I didn’t want to get what he had made with with foes, and I didn’t want to get the light bill because that bike was just It looked very unsafe. And so yeah, look, no one’s doing this. Let’s, let’s do it. I think I could, you know, I think I could figure out how to get a maid and and I also wanted to help him, you know, I felt kind of bad after hearing his story. I’m a bit of an empath, so I get happy from other people’s happiness. And, yeah, he was like, All right, so we’re going to meet every day, and we’re going to develop a business plan, and it’s going to be like a marriage. And so my creative side just instantly, like, I’ll never forget, like, our first launch the next day was I had, like, a list of names. And he was like, you know, we got a lot of steps before we’re thinking of names. And I was like, Yeah, but, you know, I want to call it something and and that gets to the name Mullen, which obviously has become a very popular name to identify a mixed wheel bike. When I, when I had come up with the name, obviously. Well, Mike hated the name. I had made some friends in the industry, like Clint Spiegel, owner of I nine. He their shop was like a mile down the road when I was living in Asheville, and he wanted to meet me hear about my adult escapade. It’s funny, a lot of people always just want to hear about that. That’s like, always very interesting. Jeff Barber 22:14Yeah, yeah. Miles 22:19So I texted him, and was like, Oh, what do you think of this name? And Clint was like, I hate it, you know, it’s trashy. I was, you know, I asked him. I’m like, Well, I asked some of the guys at, you know that, at the shop that worked there, and and I asked Tyler Benedict, the owner of Bike groomer. And, you know, I had reached out to him after he did the sticky pot, and I was like, Hey, thanks, man, and yeah, and he loved it. He thought it was great. So I convinced Mike. I was like, Yeah, this is going to be the name, trust me, it’s great. It’s catchy, and, like, there needs to be, like, a funky name, and, you know, for a bike company, because a lot of the names just have always been so generic, or you didn’t know what it was, you know, I don’t want to mention names, but yeah, yeah. Jeff Barber 23:21And, I mean, it’s kind of like, it’s like, Niner, right? Like, Niner, like, you knew what they were doing, I mean, until they stopped just making 29ers. Miles 23:30Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it was pretty edgy, you know, because everyone would just automatically think of the hair, you know. And just like, right? Some, you know, like burly dudes that just don’t give a f, you know. So, and then obviously, you know, people would ask me, Why are you calling it mullet? And I would tell them, this is in the front party in the back. And they would, you know, and they would laugh, it’s hilarious. So I did some research, making sure that the name wasn’t in use at all. You know, all the URLs were available, mulletbike, DotCom, walletcycles, DotCom, mullet bicycle, DotCom, so I bought all of them and made sure that no one had a trademark on it. And what I found was trek actually had the trademark on Mullet. Jeff Barber 24:32Trek had a bike when they did their 96 er, is that what their bike was? Well, 69 or always get it mixed up. Miles 24:39Yes, 69er, and this is where it gets, kind of like, Huh? They had, they owned Gary Fisher, and Gary Fisher had a 26er called the mullet. And that the Gary Fisher Mullet. It was like a. I don’t know what it was. I guess it was like a jump, jump 26 inch bike, because mullet is also a fish as well. And Gary Fisher would a lot of time use fish for, you know, he kind of like had a fish fetish. But, yeah, Jeff Barber 25:18I thought he was into the Grateful Dead. Miles 25:22That too. He’s into a lot of cool stuff. I mean, let’s be honest, yeah, he’s a very, very eccentric individual. Speaker 1 25:31Yeah. Miles 25:33So Trek had the trademark on Mllet, but they didn’t use it when they came out with their 69er, they just called it a 69 which was a 29 front, 26 rear. They didn’t use that trademark. Jeff Barber 25:49Good name too. I mean, depending, it’s a little little on the nose, but, Miles 25:53Yeah, yeah, a little edgy, especially for track, yeah. But yeah it was a great way to, you know, let people know that it was a mixed wheel bike, or a Franken bike, as we kind of used to call them, like when I had my big hit. We called it a Franken bike because they took a they had a big hit, a 26 or big hit, and then they had the 24 26 big hit, which, so we would call that a 46er, okay, or, or Franken bike. So, yeah, it was, it was, you know, surprising to me. I mean, not really, but I guess in hindsight, surprising to me, that Trek didn’t call the 69er a mullet. Since that firm has gained so much traction, and when I would Google search for mullet, the only thing that came up was like a cycle cross coffee club in San Francisco. I guess they call themselves, like the bullet riders. Jeff Barber 27:07And yeah, vaguely related. Miles 27:11And that the rest everything on Google was just about haircuts and stuff. So I was like, Okay, I think this name’s been the table. Jeff Barber 27:20I guess there was a thing I thought I heard too. There was, like a gearing thing, where people called, like, certain type of gearing, a mullet setup or something, but had nothing to do with the wheels, correct? Miles 27:31Yeah, that actually came in quite a bit later, as far as referring it to mullet, okay, and SRAM was the one that was doing that. They started doing that like in 2019, 2020, after like, after mullet, all of a sudden became a thing of business in the front party, like, let’s mix everything together. And I actually reached out, yeah, everything’s a mullet now, so I reached out to SRAM and said, hey, you know, I have a trademark on mullet. Can you, you know, maybe not call it a mullet. So now they call it the adventure build or something. I’m bigger. They could have come up with something more creative than that, but, yeah, but yeah, so that’s the thing now, yes. Jeff Barber 28:23And so, right? So you you were able to get this trademark, yeah? And obviously, it’s the name of of your business. And you want to make it clear that, yeah, when somebody’s saying a mullet bike, like, you know, they could be confused. Are you talking about Mullet the brand? Are you using it in this other way? And so, yeah, do you think that’s like, has that made it tougher for you, or has it helped you? Like, what do you? What do you? Kind of the strategy behind it now, right, right. Miles 28:51I mean, when it was happening, like, basically the UCI changed their rules to allow mixed wheels for the 2019, season. And so a lot of media groups made, you know, it was a pretty big deal, and they first started calling it mismatched. Number of people, obviously, you know, they’re like, it’s the return of the Franken bike. Okay, yeah. And then, you know, couple comments was like, oh, it’s the mullet. And everyone loved that, because it’s, it’s cool, it’s catchy, yeah, for sure. When that happened, I was obviously spoke to a couple people. You know, what should I do here? I would say it was like 8020 80% of them were like, Oh, it’s great for you. You should, you know, totally run with it. It’s going to bring more eyes onto you, because you’re the original mullet. I mean, we were out for sorry, i. We’re out for like, a couple of years already, to that point, like, we had started in 2017 so, you know. And I had the URL so people like, you know, when they’re Googling it, you’re gonna pop up and then, you know, I had us right. Really, really, just two people. They’re like, you know, you should probably change it. I had done a lot of work, invested a decent amount of money, you know, on the trademark, designing the head badges, getting them casted by my jeweler, the font, building the website. And I was like, Ah, he and I was like, that’s, that’s what this is, you know? I was like, this is, this is a mullet. This is, yeah, this is my bike. So, you know, sometimes it’s something I do battle with. I, you know, companies started calling the mullet, and I’d have to reach out, you know, just to try to protect my brand as best as I could without suing everybody, because I didn’t want to sue everybody I, you know, again, we carried specialized and that was kind of specialized tactic. And I always thought that that was, you know, dirty. It just wasn’t a good way to grow the bike industry, you know, like with enduro, for instance, and the Specialized Enduro. Jeff Barber 31:30And the Roubaix. There’s a lot of examples, right? Miles 31:33Yeah, yeah. And they were going after, like, bike shops and stuff. And, you know, enduro became, like a whole sect of discipline and riding, so I didn’t want to do that. So I just, you know, it’s all bike companies. You know, you probably don’t know I exist. I’m small, but, you know, have this trademark. Can you please not call it that? So they called it MX, which is why you see a lot of companies called MX. So that’s kind of Yeah, you know, I I didn’t make these bikes to sell a ton, to make friends, to be cool. I just made them because I wanted a better bike for myself. And there were certain things on the bike that I wanted, such as three, oh, tires I like a really big chain ring. I was like a runner back in high school, and I didn’t want to be able to run faster than I can pedal. And yeah, with a 38 two chainring and a 52 cassette, I’d be able to climb anything. And then when it came to descending, I’d be pedaling past people, and they’re in their tuck, you know, if we’re on the fire road, or if I’m on like, a long, descending single track, I can still keep my speed up without just pedaling out. And yeah, people weren’t offering that. So, yeah. Jeff Barber 33:09So talk about what makes a Mullet Cycles bike different from other mixed wheel bikes. You know, obviously when you first started out, there weren’t a lot of choices. I mean, sounds like there were two, maybe, yeah, now seems like everybody’s got a mixed wheel bike. So what? What makes mullet cycles bike different from from all the other ones that are on the market? Miles 33:30So this kind of, I would say, the geometry, the geometry is, is the big deal with it, which is why I don’t publish it. When we were building out prototypes, I still had, like, a vision of certain numbers. I was like, and I, I need the head angle to be this. I need, I need the bottom bracket to be here. And Mike was pretty adamant. He was like, Look, if you want to make a bunch of prototypes, go ahead and time test them and you know, see, see what’s going to be the best. So I made, like, over a dozen prototypes, ranging from like head angles, from 62 like all the way up to 68 different bottom bracket heights, different seat angles, different chain stay lengths. And over the course of almost a year, I would ride like sometimes three times a day on section 16, which in that trail in the springs, kind of has everything they have dumbed it down. It’s not as chunky as it used to be, but had really steep switchbacks. Jeff Barber 34:53 I remember riding it when I lived there for sure. Miles 34:57Oh, okay, so yes, you’re familiar with. It, yeah, that’s, I felt like that was a great proving ground. Jeff Barber 35:05Sad that they dumbed it down. It was definitely a challenging trail. Miles 35:09Yeah, a lot of people got hurt. So, you know, what are you gonna do? I guess the town just didn’t want to get sued, or, who knows. So when I was time testing and everything like there was. I remember one prototype that just felt really fast, but it just wasn’t the fastest on Strava. And one particular was consistently the fastest on climbing and descending. And again. Long story short, this was the this was, this was the geometry. And it wasn’t what, at that time, modern geometry, you know, you had long, low, Slack it. It didn’t follow those guidelines at all. And, you know, the difference between a bike from the 90s versus one today is geometry you can put, like great suspension, great brakes on a bike from the late 90s, it’s still going to feel very unstable and ultimately slow. So like, yeah, you know, dirt bikes get their speed out of motors. We kind of get our speed out of geometry, like a modern hardtail with modern geometry symmetrical wheel or safety bike will be faster than a downhaul bike from the late 90s, and what’s his name, did a test. Kyle Warner did a YouTube video on that with his Niner hardtail versus like a retro downhill bike, and the hardtail ended up being faster. So with mixed wheels, I do, you know, there were things that you’re able to do that you couldn’t really get away with on a symmetrical wheel bike, or 29 or 275 or platform, and you know, it’s still something I kind of struggle with, because I would love to share the geometry, but at the same time, people would see the geometry and probably say, I can’t that. I can’t ride that on my trails. It’s, you know, I’ll get hurt. Jeff Barber 37:40Yeah. Yeah. I mean, is it like, I know you won’t, you won’t share the numbers, but yeah, I guess you’re saying it would be surprising to people, or shocking, or they’d be like, Whoa, that number is ridiculously high or ridiculously low. That couldn’t possibly work. Miles 37:55Okay, yes, yes, because I, have, you know, told some of my friends, and they’re like, that makes no sense, you know, like, after they ride the bike, and they’re like, Okay, yeah, it’s fast, oh yeah, you know, they open up their Strava and they got a bunch of PRs, and they’re like, Okay, please tell me. And I tell them, they’re like, that doesn’t make sense. So, you know, released into Geometry, people would look at me and be like, they don’t know what they’re doing. And then specialized, or one of these big box brands would do it, and then it would be okay, you know, kind of like, you know, specialized in Loic Bruni, you know, he was one of the first Jeff Barber 38:47You still haven’t seen, still haven’t seen those numbers from anybody that get close? Miles 38:53They’re still pretty far away. And now, okay, new trends have come with really steep seed angles, and now they’re going longer. Chain stays like the industry is always evolving geometry, and I firmly believe it will continue to evolve. It’s a great way for companies to sell you a new bike every year. It’s marketing, and marketing is a hell of a drug. And you get really fast riders that can be fast on anything, and they’re fast on this quote, unquote, newer geometry. And then everyone’s like, Oh, that’s what I need. So it’s like, I get it like, you know, like people want to know the geometry, and real writers want to know I totally understand, because I’m a real writer, and I don’t know if I. Would trust a company that wouldn’t release their geometry, because that’s just generally how you get a good idea of how the bike’s going to perform and behave on certain trails. So I you know it’s kind of like proprietary information. If you look at dirt bikes, which is a great example, most of them don’t release their geometry, and most of dirt bikes, their geometry hasn’t changed since the 90s. They took a lot of like the 70s and 80s, figuring out different wheel diameters and different geometry, and then they got, you know, 90s came, and they basically optimized it, and it really hasn’t altered off of that platform Since to this day. So that’s kind of like, and obviously they’re using mixed wheels as well. So I kind of, you know, look at it at that perspective, like it’s proprietary. It’s the blueprints of this bike. If I were to publish them, I would get, you know, there’s, like, a lot of these steel garage welders kind of thing, and they would do it and say, Holy smokes. And, you know, I don’t know, it’s like, Well, I came up with that. Jeff Barber 41:38So, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, it sets you apart for sure, and it’s the secret sauce, and it’s a little bit different, a little bit of mystery. And I’m sure people appreciate that. Maybe beyond the bikes, the designs that you know, the geometry, the technical secret sauce, the thing that strikes me when I look at mullet cycles, bikes, and like the one that I tested is they’re just, they’re beautiful bikes, the frame, the finishes, and then the build as well. And I know that you’ve worked exactly designer in the past, and so I’m curious, does that experience kind of carry over into your bike builds? Like, are you looking at these as if they’re like, a piece of jewelry? Miles 42:24I am a red blooded male. Like, I it’s, it’s got to look hot, if it’s not hot. Like, or, you know, I mean, the bikes, you know, when I go out on trails, a lot of people because they just don’t know the brand. I really don’t do a lot of advertising or marketing. It’s just, I just made the bikes. And if you want it, here you go. You want something that’s cool and fast and, you know, kind of reliable. This is it. But, yeah, I always had like an eye for things like, even when I had my foes, they would always be tricked out in such a way that, I mean, you know, they would look cool like I would, you know, my friends would make fun of me for it, because they could. But when I would go out, people be like, Oh, wow, that thing looks cool like I had my foes FXR at my booth in 2015 Interbike, and it was a real eye catcher, and people were coming up to it. I had, like, white wall tires and stuff, and a lot of purple, and it looked like a beach cruiser, but, yeah, cool. So, yeah, I made so many drawings of our bikes, like I have a book of probably 500 I mean, a lot of all different lines, and yet it had to be esthetically pleasing. Wow. And coincide, you know, with the geometry, and same with the single pivot, like single pivot generally look pretty old school, very basic. So trying to make, and then we used an elevated chain stay as well. So trying to make that look, in my opinion, and some people might think it’s ugly and it’s totally fine, in for me, it’s just a very, Jeff Barber 44:39Very good looking, yeah, it’s a challenge to make look cool. Miles 44:44Yeah, you need functional cool. And the elevated chainsack, I really didn’t want to do that was really like, Mike’s thing. And he explained to me, he’s like, look you. You want the big top. Tire. You want the big chain ring. The only way we’re going to be able to do this is if we do an elevated chainstack. And he was like, just make it look cool. He was like, that, you know, okay, you know, you worked as a wax model maker. You should be able to to make it look like art. And in my opinion, that I think they do. I think they look like jewelry. They’re gorgeous bikes in person. There’s so much, dare I say, prettier, Jeff Barber 45:35Yeah, lots of details that you don’t necessarily get from the photos. So one thing I noticed is you don’t offer any carbon fiber bikes, all aluminum, though you did also you’re bringing back a titanium version of the honeymaker. So yeah, why not carbon? Why? Why do you stick with metal bikes? Miles 45:55That’s a good question. I’ve always had bad experiences with carbon, I would just break them after I didn’t have a carbon bike for like, longer than, let’s say, five months before it would fail on me. So, oh geez, it was, it was definitely a topic with my manufacturer because of the lines that I wanted to do. I, you know, showed them my drawings of the tubes, and I was, I was wanted to do hydroforming, and they said, you know, it would be a lot less expensive if you went the carbon fiber route. Carbon fiber frames are actually really surprisingly inexpensive to manufacture, quite a bit less than my aluminum frames. It might come surprising to people. I do believe that might be why a lot of bike manufacturers are able to offer a lifetime warranty, because there’s they’re pretty inexpensive to make, but it’s carbon fiber. So people think, well, I should be spending a lot of money on this. I I believe that carbon is great for pavement. It’s really stiff, really light. And you know you want. You want something really stiff, that that gets all your power down, and for a full suspension, you want something right, that’s laterally stiff, so that rear triangle is just going on a vertical path, so it’s just it, it’s easier on the bearings, easier on the shock, and the bike will feel more plush than if that rear end is flexing. But again, I just, I had really bad experiences with it. A lot of the times I would break them, if I would crash the bike, would just kind of, I would walk back to the bike, and then I would, you know, I would inspect it, and I would see a hole in it because it hit a rock. Miles 48:06So for me, it, I liked aluminum. I mean, there’s obviously steel as well, which is another fabulous metal. It’s very strong. Obviously they make bridges out of it for full suspension. I I, I admire the power, or the strength to weight ratio that aluminum provides. It’s and when I’m climbing, I having something lighter, it’s just going to get me up the hill faster. So, right, yep, aluminum, I just felt was going to be the best material, at least for a full suspension bike. For the hardtail, we could have done steel. Our frames would have been a lot less expensive because it’s such an inexpensive material, and it’s also far easier to weld than aluminum. But again, I love speed. I kind of like a speed. All I want to do is just go fast. So having an aluminum frame, even a hardtail frame, was just going to be faster than a steel frame. And what’s great about steel is it is very compliant. So it does like to stretch and bend and flex. It likes it. That’s why like bridges again made of steel, so the bridge can flex train rails, steel. If you ever watch a train going over the rails, you can see the the wheels flexing the steel. Titanium offers a lot. Lot of similarities to steel with that compliance, but it kind of has like all the good, none of the bad, obviously, other than the price, it’s still pretty easy to well, but the material is far more expensive. However, it’s far lighter and it won’t rust or corrode. So all the bikes that I make I ride, yeah, right, it’s just an advantage. And I just all the bikes I ride, I just want to go fast. So, you know, would I sell more if I would make him in steel, probably, you know, steel is real. Is a great marketing term, but I wouldn’t be going as fast. Jeff Barber 50:52Well, speaking of going fast, your website teases a mixed wheel gravel slash adventure bike. So I’m curious about that bike. What’s the thinking behind a mullet gravel bike? And where are you kind of in that development process? Miles 51:07I believe that a symmetrical wheel bike. It’s based off the road bike platform mountain bikes being symmetrical. And also, like in the early days, it was basically road bike geometry. It was just using knobby tires. So I don’t, after diving into this mixed wheel hole that I have for almost 10 years, I look at a mixed wheel bike as the dirt bike platform. Your front axle sits higher than career axle, so it’s more difficult to go over the handlebars. And there are things that you can do on a dirt bike platform, as far as geometry that you just can’t do on the road bike platform, symmetrical wheels. Gravel bikes were going off road. You uh, going over the handlebar sucks. And I kind of got into gravel riding because, you know, I just enjoyed it. You can really put in a lot of miles and see certain places that you know, generally you might not see, at least on my mountain bike trails where I was living. So, yeah, I’ve went over the handlebars on a gravel bike a couple times, and I’ve, it’s said I need to make a gravel bike with a larger front wheel where my front axle is higher, because when you are running a larger front wheel, you’re basically lifting up on the handlebars almost an inch off the ground. Even when you’re obviously not, it’s just all the time like that. And when you come up to an obstacle or something that looks a little sketch that’s in the road, you lift up on the handlebars so and sometimes you don’t even see it, if it’s like a pothole, and you just got your head down. So by doing, by by running a larger front wheel, it just made the bike more stable off road. So figuring out the geometry, again, has been nothing short of a lot of work. Again, I made a bunch of prototypes. I’ve been working on it since 2019 so like six years almost, which is nuts, yeah, but it like it had to be perfect, and it had to be better. I just didn’t want to make a mixed wheel gravel bike and say, Oh, here’s the mixed wheel gravel bike. You should buy it like, because I ride it and it needed to impress me, and it needed to be faster than what I, you know, my road bike, platform gravel bike, my 700 C from rear it needed to be faster, both on climbing and obviously descending. I couldn’t just take the geometry for my hardtail and copy it. Of course, I made a prototype like that, and it just, it didn’t, just didn’t feel right, and I wasn’t fitted on the bike properly with the drop bar. So finally, and it, it’s somewhat funny, like I Strava testing on gravel is a lot more. The segments are longer. And some days you feel good, you know, on a 4050, mile ride, some days you don’t, and it takes a lot of time. So comparing times, it was difficult. When I finally i. Figured out the geometry I was living in Alabama, and my dealer southern carnage, and I forgot what it’s like a small town in Alabama, but he’s such a cool bike shop. He’s a bit of an OG down owner as well. He did group gravel rides once a week, and he would have, like, groups of 3020, people. And he’s, he’s turned into a fairly big gravel rider, and we’re the same height. So I dropped off this final prototype to him, and I told him, tell me what’s wrong with it. I was I told him, I don’t care which What does. What it does good, I need to know what it does bad. And because I couldn’t find anything anymore, I was like, I think this is it. And I almost wanted to make another prototype so that Thursday, so it’s Friday. I called him because I didn’t hear from him, and I was like, So what’s wrong with it? And he goes, Well, sorry, you’re not going to be able to get it back. And I’m like, Oh no. Something go wrong? And he said, No, I’m keeping it. You’re not getting this back. Let me know how much you want. And I started laughing. I was like, so it’s so, so you like it? And he was like, it is perfect. I this is, you got to make this. I’ve been working on them. I ended up having to make my own fork. So I made my own titanium fork, and in order to coincide with the geometry that was one of the missing pieces of why it was I just couldn’t find a fork, and I couldn’t design the frame around the fork to get just proper stack heights and stuff to make me fit right, and also get the hammer down when I’m pedaling or out of the saddle, and still be stable and easy to turn on like 2030, mile an hour descent. So anyway, yeah, probably in the next couple months I’m going to release it. I’m only making 30 of them, so very limited. I just kind of want it for myself again. And, yeah, if other people want it cool, maybe I’ll make more again, you know, in like a year or so. But it was just, it’s she was so much work, and I’d imagine other companies will probably make a mixed will gravel bike down the line. I don’t see why not. I mean, just even taking a single track off off of a gravel road, you just don’t feel like you’re gonna die, and you’re still able to have fun. And that’s what bikes are about. Jeff Barber 57:58Yeah, that’s a good upgrade, and to fit smaller riders, I would guess too, people are Yeah, in between like a, like a 650 B gravel bike and a regular full size 700 C, yeah, it makes sense. So yeah, in addition to mullet cycles, you run miles wide industries which offers some unique products. We kind of talked about cable buddies, the fork, cork, sticky fingers, brake lever covers, which one of those products, or any of your products, is your your personal favorite? Miles 58:33You know, that’s a really, really hard question. I probably, and this might come as a surprise, I’d probably say the Wet Seal stiction lubricant, Jeff Barber 58:52Okay, yeah. Miles 58:54And it’s, it’s not the same formula as my old company. This actually developed when I was living in Asheville. So back like in 2014 2015 is when I came out with this. And the suspension experts, which was a suspense bike suspension shop in Asheville, they ended up getting purchased by Fox, but they were really good. And the I kind of worked with the owner on that, on coming up with something that would be safe and work and not attract dust and residue that stuff the moment I put it on my fork or my shock, it just instantly makes it feel like butter, instantly. And then, as well as my dropper post, so instantly, just like, Bing, fly right up, if it was having trouble going up. I use that stuff a lot. Jeff Barber 59:53Yeah, I’ve used it for sure, like on a sticky dropper post, one that I like, I actually, you know, probably. Really needed to service it, but, yeah, just put it’s a good band aid. Miles 1:00:05It’s a good band aid. Then I’ll probably, I mean, it comes close with the sticky fingers, the grips, because I don’t ride with gloves. And obviously, when I’m every time I ride, I’m on my brakes, I’m using them so and either times when I take them off, or I have a customer’s bike that I built up, and you know, their option without them, and I’ll do a quick parking lot ride just to make sure everything’s styled and it feels wrong grabbing metal brake levers. It just they almost like, I don’t want to sound like a wimp, but they almost hurt after being so used to the grips. So, you know, I mean, and the four quarts, great too. I have, like, a little plug kit for tubeless plugs, and that has saved me and a bunch of my friends, you know, it’s one of those things, like, is anybody have a spare plug, you know? Like, and I’ve got, yeah, I’ve got 10 of them right here in my steer tube, like a plow, you know, and that’s that one has saved. You know, if you, if you talk to me when I’m like, 15 miles out from a trailhead, 20 miles sometimes, and I got a flat all day. I’m gonna say this is the best product I’ve come out with, for sure, because it’s there and you never forget it. It just sits inside your your head tube. So yeah, but I priced it, yeah, the Wet Seal, and that stuff is, is butter, and there’s been a number of companies that have tried to replicate it over the years, because that stuff’s been out for like, 10 years already. But yeah, my formula is the best. Jeff Barber 1:02:01So, yeah, cool. Well, we talked about the titanium honeymaker that you just rolled out, and then obviously you’re working on the gravel bike. But what else is there? Anything else that’s next for Mullet or Miles Wide you can tell us about? Miles 1:02:21So for Mullet, I’m kind of working on something, which I mean, I would love to share, but if I do, everyone’s gonna kind of jump on it, and I don’t want to, I want to release it and then say, Here surprise. So, yeah, can’t really, you know, the gravel bike is kind of like the next, the next thing you might see, like a teaser of what I’m doing. I mean, I really don’t post on social media. I could totally hire someone, obviously, but it’s just, I don’t I, I don’t think it’s healthy. I don’t know. I’m not. I guess I’m an older generation and I’m not. Yeah, I don’t get into it, but I’ll probably, I’ll probably shoot a shoot out a little teaser of what you could expect, as far as miles wide. I’ve got like a shock grease that which you can use on anything that I’ve been working on. I’ll probably release that in a couple months. It’s really good. And then I’ve got this thing, which I don’t know if the video is, is on or not, but this is like a little four cork attachment thing. And, yeah, I don’t know if this might not be PC to show, but yeah, it’s like, it’s a, it’s a little doohickey that you can I guess smoke oregano out of. And it attaches to the fork cork. And it’s got a little secret storage compartment in here, and then it goes back into, you know, screws onto the fork cork, hides in your steer too. I’ve got that, and I’ve also got a multi tool as well that attaches to the four cork that will probably won’t be ready for a couple more months, and that, you know well, and if you don’t, Jeff Barber 1:04:54if you don’t partake of the oregano, you could use that to put like a have one of those Air Tags, right? That’s a good spot to put an Air Tag so nobody steals your bike. Miles 1:05:04Yeah, people have, like, sent me photos of stuff, of what they stick up their exterior tube. It’s very impressive. I’ve seen like first aid kit to emergency energy bars, like, yeah, a bunch of cash, yeah, it’s, it’s, it’s a hole, you know, might as well fill it with something instead of just leaving it exposed to mud and water. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, and obviously an air cat, yeah, you can totally stick an air tag up there. Jeff Barber 1:05:48Well, miles, it’s been great talking with you today and hearing the backstory behind mullet cycles and miles wide industries, I know our listeners are going to enjoy getting a deeper understanding of Wake what, 321, of what makes your bikes and accessories unique, and we’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for that gravel bike and whatever else you’ve got in the works. So thanks for sharing with us. Miles 1:06:10Hey, thanks so much for having me. So I hope it wasn’t too long, and I hope it was interesting for people. Jeff Barber 1:06:18Oh, it was great.

As it opens its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, fintech giant Revolut has pledged to invest £3 billion in the UK, creating 1000 new high-skilled jobs over the next five years. 3 23 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Revolut's pledge comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, says: "Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change."Earlier this year, the Financial Times reported that Reeves had clashed with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey over efforts to accelerate Revolut's authorisation as a fully-licenced bank, with Reeves eager to see the fintech get the greenlight as soon as possible.Revolut's UK commitment is part of a wider five-year global plan to invest £10 billion and create 10,000 jobs as it targets 100 million customers by mid 2027 and entry into 30 new markets by 2030.The firm is expecting to launch as a bank in Mexico next year, with entry into Colombia and Argentina also planned. Having secured a payments license in April, it is preparing to launch in India, while a push into Africa is underway, beginning with South Africa.Nik Storonsky, CEO, Revolut, says: “Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. "From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers."

Big Mike’s, the well-known restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, is closing, with its owner citing “insurmountable challenges” in the industry. In a post on Instagram, chef and proprietor Gareth Smith said Sunday was the restaurant’s last service. “This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write. It feels like failure, but it isn’t. We’re proud of what we achieved, we shot for the stars, poured everything into it – heart, soul, sweat, tears, life savings, even the house deposit – but the brutal truth is the maths just don’t math any more,” he wrote. He said he was proud of his team and grateful to his guests and suppliers. “My final act as gaffer is to go to bat for my staff so they land safely in new homes,” he added.

Thursday is the new Friday’Opens in new window ] Big Mike’s has been in operation since 2022. In an unusual approach, Mr Smith raised €400,000 of the €1.6 million start-up costs for the restaurant by forward-selling vouchers to a group of 40 regulars in his other outlets, Michael’s and Little Mike’s in Mount Merrion, both of which have since closed.

‘Fox News Sunday’ anchor Shannon Bream previews her show on the FBI raid of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s home and potential charges over alleged confidential emails on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is setting its sights on insurance companies that may have discriminated against entities with right-wing views. The committee is also looking into whether retirees' pension accounts were being used to invest in progressive policies they may not necessarily agree with, Fox News Digital has learned. "The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating improper restrictions on access to capital and capital markets of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries (such as cryptocurrency, energy, and firearms)," Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). "The Committee has engaged with whistleblowers who had their insurance policies cancelled for widely-held political positions or for operating legal businesses considered out of favor by progressive activists." HOUSE PASSES TRUMP-BACKED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer is expanding his probe into financial discrimination against right-wing entities and people. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The move is an expansion of the House Oversight Committee's ongoing investigation into whether public financial institutions engaged in debanking against people and entities with right-wing views. Comer is also probing whether companies implementing progressive policies are doing so at the expense of millions of retired Americans' personal investments. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in his capacity as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that his panel "is investigating the prolific use of proxy proposals and other activism targeting corporate boards of directors by activists pursuing political agendas at the expense of the retirement and personal savings of Americans." BILL BARR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T SEE INFO THAT WOULD 'IMPLICATE' TRUMP IN EPSTEIN CASE, COMER SAYS "Specifically, the Committee seeks to understand how giant investment managers and pension fund managers, aided by proxy advisory firms, sidestepped or abandoned their fiduciary duties to beneficiaries to pursue a political agenda and whether new legislation is needed to protect investors," Comer stated. "At a minimum, Americans deserve to fully know if their hard-earned savings are being used in a progressive playbook." The letter accused certain large asset management firms like BlackRock of putting clients' money into green energy initiatives, for example, rather than more profitable areas, in order to promote a left-wing agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is pictured during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2025. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images) BlackRock pushed back on such accusations in a public statement on its website, however. "One of the most critical tasks of an asset manager is to provide clients with insights on short- and long-term trends in the global economy that can impact their portfolios. We do this across all sectors – from healthcare to technology to energy," the company wrote. "Climate risk is one such trend given its implications for the economy. We believe that companies that better manage their exposure to climate risk and capitalize on opportunities will generate better long term financial outcomes." BlackRock's website also asserted that the "choice of where to invest ultimately rests with our clients." "We are bound to adhere to their investment guidelines and objectives. We do not dictate particular investment strategies," it said. And on a broader scale, the committee looking into whether publicly-traded companies are running afoul of President Donald Trump's executive order outlawing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices by simply listing it under another name. "[T]he Committee remains concerned following reports of publicly traded companies intentionally camouflaging or rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies to hide such discrimination from "the Trump Administration, courts or influential activists,'" Comer wrote to several organizations opposing corporate discrimination, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. "At minimum, shareholders and retirement plan beneficiaries deserve transparency around discriminatory practices employed by corporate directors and officers as such behavior is rebranded. Replacing DEI and ESG titles with 'employee engagement' or ‘inclusion and impact’ represents yet another deceptive practice." President Donald Trump walks to Air Force One at Morristown Airport on Sept. 14, 2025, in Morristown, New Jersey. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump's order, signed in January 2025, barred financial institutions, major corporations, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies and specific industries like medicine and commercial airlines from promoting or implementing DEI standards. Comer accused the previous White House of promoting discriminatory practices, however, in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The Oversight Committee is investigating discriminatory practices in the American financial system and the Biden Administration’s role in supporting them," he wrote. "Whether it is using the boardroom to achieve what the political left could not accomplish at the ballot box, or canceling Americans’ insurance policies and debanking them for their political views, these actions are wrong and deprive Americans of their constitutional rights."

Title: BlackRock’s crypto ETFs generate $260 million annual revenue

Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:59:53Z

BlackRock’s cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have emerged as a highly profitable venture, generating $260 million in annualized revenue, according to recent data shared by Leon Waidmann, head of research at the nonprofit Onchain Foundation. The revenue includes $218 million from Bitcoin ETFs and $42 million from Ether-based products. The performance underscores the growing role of regulated crypto investment products in institutional finance. BlackRock’s success is being closely watched by other traditional asset managers as a potential benchmark for launching similar offerings in the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Analysts highlight the significance of BlackRock’s ETFs in positioning cryptocurrencies as a serious asset class within traditional finance. Waidmann likened the ETFs’ trajectory to Amazon’s early business model, noting that the funds provide a practical entry point into the crypto ecosystem for institutional investors and retirement accounts. “This isn’t experimentation anymore,” Waidmann said. “The world’s largest asset manager has proven that crypto is a serious profit center. That’s a quarter-billion-dollar business, built almost overnight. For comparison, many fintech unicorns don’t make that in a decade.” The performance of these ETFs may encourage more institutional players to enter the crypto market, extending the current market cycle beyond the typical four-year Bitcoin halving-driven patterns. Analysts suggest that inflows from corporate treasuries and ETF products could continue to drive demand for both Bitcoin and Ether. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is approaching a significant milestone, with total assets under management (AUM) nearing $85 billion. This accounts for approximately 57.5% of the total US spot Bitcoin ETF market, according to blockchain data from Dune. By comparison, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF holds $22.8 billion, representing 15.4% of market share, making it the second-largest US spot Bitcoin ETF. The rapid growth of BlackRock’s fund is noteworthy given its short history, debuting on January 11, 2024. In less than two years, it has climbed from being the 31st largest fund across both crypto and traditional ETFs to the 22nd largest, according to VettaFi. Market analysts are optimistic that continued ETF inflows could support a renewed rally in Bitcoin prices. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget exchange, suggested that the institutional appetite for crypto ETFs helps establish a bullish floor for risk assets, reinforcing a “buy the dip” strategy amid ongoing macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Additionally, there is speculation that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in US 401(k) retirement plans could further bolster demand for Bitcoin, with some projections estimating potential price targets as high as $200,000 by year-end, according to André Dragosch, head of European research at crypto asset manager Bitwise. BlackRock’s crypto ETFs illustrate the increasing intersection of traditional finance with the digital asset market. The funds’ performance demonstrates not only the profitability of regulated crypto products but also their capacity to attract institutional capital and provide a structured entry point for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape.

Title: Maria Steen profile: Campaign for Áras attempts to paint her as challenger of status quo

Full Content:
Broadcaster Brendan O’Connor was in the plush Park Hotel in Kenmare for a family break, when he noticed a married couple with a “pristine” Mad Men kind of glamour who were also enjoying a weekend away. The RTÉ veteran would later recount how he struck up a conversation with the wife. She turned to him, “like something from a Tennessee Williams play”, and said: “I believe I have you at a disadvantage. I’m Maria Steen. I really hope there’s no hard feelings.” It was 2014, and O’Connor had earlier that year been plunged into a national controversy known as “Pantigate”. His Saturday night talkshow was forced into a €85,000 defamation payout after Ireland’s pre-eminent drag queen Panti Bliss had suggested on the prime time show that members of the Iona Institute and other conservative columnists were homophobic. The public broadcaster would be castigated after it emerged it had made the payout to John Waters, David Quinn, Dr Patricia Casey, Dr John Murray and Steen. Throughout the 2010s, the Iona Institute had become synonymous with a conservative resistance to social change. The Catholic think-tank was already bracing for the anticipated referendum on marriage equality the following year. By this point, Steen had emerged as one of its strongest campaigners with her staunch arguments against the 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. Before 2012, the Iona Institute had largely avoided abortion debates because it felt the pro-life campaign space was saturated. But when the Fine Gael-led coalition moved to legislate for the X case in the wake of the death of Savita Halappanavar, the Iona Institute was galvanised and put Ms Steen forward as a spokeswoman against the proposed law. [ Independent Ireland votes to back Maria Steen’s candidacy for presidentOpens in new window ] Over 10 years later, Steen’s conservative comrades in the Iona Institute would only learn from The Irish Times that the stay-at-home mother was considering running for president. During Pantigate, Steen and her colleagues were seen by some as the last vestiges of the old Irish establishment. Now Steen is being presented by her backers as the only true anti-establishment voice in the presidential field, given her almost outré views on social issues. Ten years on from the marriage equality referendum, Steen’s campaign seeks to frame her as a trailblazing challenger to the new orthodoxy of progressive Ireland. Steen was raised in Ballsbridge and is the daughter of the well-known auctioneer Seán Davin. Her aunts include former presidential candidate Joan Freeman and Theresa Lowe, the barrister and former RTÉ presenter. Her mother Margaret Davin taught her to read, write and tell the time before she started school, which Steen would cite as the foundation of her desire to homeschool her own children. She is married to senior counsel Neil Steen and they have five children together. They have enjoyed a comfortable south Dublin family life, with the 2016 renovation of their exclusive multimillion euro Blackrock home meriting an article in the property section of The Irish Times. Steen first qualified as an architect and then later as a barrister. As a mother she would qualify as a Montessori teacher and choose to work within the home. This would form the basis of her strong performance against the 2024 family and care referendums, particularly her advocacy of stay-at-home mothers. She is profoundly orthodox Catholic, and has opposed divorce and complained about “the death of procreative sex”. In 2018, the telegenic Steen became the No side’s most valuable weapon in their campaign to keep the Eighth Amendment. She dominated in an infamous television debate on Claire Byrne Live. The event was decried by the Yes side who claimed audience members had been jeering and sniggering. Steen did so well that the anti-abortion campaign tried to swap her out for fellow campaigner Cora Sherlock on a Prime Time debate the following week, resulting in a huge behind-the-scenes row with RTÉ. In the end, the show went to air with just one politician from each side: Simon Harris for Yes and Peadar Tóibín for No, which forced Miriam O’Callaghan to apologise to viewers for an abortion debate led by two men. Within Leinster House, many independents who don’t agree with Steen’s arch-conservative views are backing her on a freedom of expression basis. There is also a fear emerging among conservatives that in a three horse race, Catherine Connolly would “hand the presidency to the Government”. While there is a collegiate respect from many independents towards the liberal Connolly, many feel that Steen would present a greater challenge to the status quo.

Title: Crypto ETNs: what you need to know
URL: https://monevator.com/crypto-etns/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:11:08Z
Full Content:
Exciting news: after three years of prohibition, UK retail investors will again be able to buy exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifts its ban on 8 October. Compliant products will likely hit mainstream brokers shortly thereafter. According to the FCA, 12% of UK adults own crypto assets (around seven million people) and 26% of non-crypto asset owners say, “they would be more likely to buy crypto assets if the market and activities were regulated.” In other words, crypto is gaining acceptance as a part of many people’s investment portfolios. (At least until the next crypto winter.) What we want to know is: That will do for starters. Exchange-traded products of all types (ETFs, ETNs, and ETCs) enable more everyday people to invest in an asset class without getting embroiled in all the hassle that direct ownership usually brings with it. You get the idea. With exchange-traded products, you can outsource the grief of asset ownership to trusted providers for a reasonable fee. However that doesn’t mean all exchange-traded products are the same. If you buy an MSCI World ETF then you can be pretty sure you are getting well regulated exposure to over a thousand leading stock market-listed companies. But ETNs are not ETFs. And crypto ownership entails different risks to share ownership. Importantly, you don’t actually own any crypto when you invest in this type of product. But the ETN issuer may well do. That exposes it and you to a steaming jungle of risks that I’ll touch upon below. Meanwhile the rest of this article will help you go into all this with your eyes wide open. The FCA has only green-lit the sale of crypto ETNs (not ETFs) to retail investors in the UK.1 The UK-approved crypto ETN headlines are: ETNs aren’t new. They’ve been used to track certain assets (like old-school currencies) long before crypto. Indeed crypto ETNs aren’t new either. They were offered to the UK public up until they were restricted in January 2021. And they’ve gathered billions in assets from UK professional investors and European retail investors since then. These existing products are obviously the ones most likely to come on-stream for retail investors after 8 October. Which is handy for us, because it means we can size them up beforehand. Crypto ETNs are issued by both traditional investment asset managers and crypto-native outfits. Familiar names that already offer ETNs in the UK and Europe include WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, VanEck, and BlackRock. Crypto-focussed brands include 21Shares, Bitwise, Coinbase, and Valour. ETNs are debt securities rather than investment funds. In exchange for your cash, you get a promise that the issuer will pay you a return in the future. What happens if the ETN’s issuer defaults? In that case you may be paid less than you are owed – or not at all. In debt parlance, you’ll ‘take a haircut’. Probably one that feels more like the medieval lock-chopping practised by religious maniacs than a nice tint and blow-dry down your local salon. But what might prevent you from getting entirely mullet-ed in such a scenario is collateral. A ‘collateralised’ ETN protects the value of your investment with a big stash of assets lodged with an (ideally) independent and reputable custodian. Should your issuer be unable to pay, this collateral can be sold to honour the debt. You might ask does your issuer stow away enough collateral to cover the value of its obligations? Is the collateral good quality? Will it fetch enough on the market to pay back investors during a crisis? All good questions, which you’ll have to answer on a case-by-case basis (and by delving into the details provided by your ETN on its website). ETNs can be dated or undated debt instruments. You’d expect crypto ETNs to be undated – that is, for the security to be available so long as there’s a market for it and nothing blows up. But an ETN can be called. This means the issuer can redeem it at any time – paying back investors with the cash in the collateral kitty. It’s worth reading the ETN’s prospectus to understand what happens in the event your chosen product is redeemed early. Especially the sections on how the claims of other parties will be paid before the investors. You’ll likely come across choice phrases such as: …following satisfaction of all priority claims, such Security holders [that’s us!] may not receive payment of the Early Redemption Amount in full and may receive substantially less and may potentially receive nothing. There’s lovely. There’ll also be an early redemption fee to boot. So choose an ETN that’s stocked with plenty of collateral. The issuer is under no obligation to make any other assets available in the event of a shortfall. ETNs can be synthetic as opposed to physically backed. A synthetic ETN employs a swap-based derivative to deliver the performance of the underlying asset. This introduces another layer of counterparty risk, because the company providing the swap could fail. This may be moot for now, since it looks like only physically-backed crypto ETNs will be admitted to the London Stock Exchange. But it’s still worth checking if you’re compiling a shortlist of candidates. Here’s a quick USD comparison of the Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) versus Bitcoin’s market price. Source: Google Finance (26 Sep 2020 to 22 September 2025). Source: justETF (26 Sep 2020 to 19 September 2025). JustETF and Google Finance can’t quite agree on what five years is, so up next is the result I got when I matched the dates for a comparable long-term view: Dates: 26 Sep 2020 to 19 September 2025. (BTCE inception date: 9 Jun 2020, TER: 2%.) That’s an astounding return from Bitcoin either way – assuming you held on during the 77% death slide from November 2021 through November 2022. But still, BTCE gave up 5% a year in comparison to Bitcoin – a tracking difference that isn’t entirely accounted for by the ETN’s eye-watering 2% TER. Transaction costs, taxation, blockchain network fees, collateral overheads, brokerage charges, and various other operational frictions can all eat into your return without necessarily being captured by the TER. You’re also likely to see a clause like this nestled in a crypto ETN’s prospectus: The market value and price of the ETP securities does not exclusively depend on the prevailing price of bitcoin and changes in the prevailing price of bitcoin may not necessarily result in a comparable change in the market value of the ETP securities. Other ETNs may track their linked cryptocurrency more faithfully than BTCE. I haven’t checked other products or timeframes. But the point here is I’ve never seen such a large tracking difference gap when investigating vanilla ETFs tethered to mainstream asset classes. On that basis, I recommend checking the tracking difference performance of all your prospective ETN candidates versus their linked cryptocurrencies. It looks like being an important factor. Watch out for wide spreads, too. This is another cost of business that may vary widely, depending on the ETN’s liquidity and, at times, shifting perceptions of the creditworthiness of the issuer and any associated service providers. Reading the risk section of a crypto ETN’s prospectus is like visiting a chamber of horrors. Every grisly fate and sticky end your ETN could meet is listed. Or at least I hope it’s listed. Either way it’s an educational read and, if you’re on the fence about crypto investing, it could send you running in the opposite direction of the alluring 900% return graph I showed above. To give you a flavour, let’s pick out a few highlights from the risk section of the iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) prospectus. (To be clear this is just illustrative: I have no reason to believe that IB1T is a particularly risky crypto ETN.) What follows is a sample of the higher-dimensional risk space you enter when crypto is involved. It’s got more dimensions than string theory… …the Issuer’s bitcoin may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which may result in the value of the Securities being reduced, potentially to zero. A breach of the Issuer’s account at the Custodian or the Prime Execution Agent could result in the partial or total loss of the Issuer’s assets, which is likely to result in a partial or full loss in the value of the Securities. If any relevant Cryptoassets are lost, stolen, damaged or otherwise compromised in circumstances in which the Custodian, the Prime Execution Agent, another service provider to the Issuer or any other party is liable to the Issuer for such loss, theft, damage or compromise, the Custodian, the Prime Execution Agent or other responsible party may not have sufficient resources to fully compensate the Issuer. The security procedures in place for the Issuer’s bitcoin may include offline ‘cold’ storage, the use of multiple encrypted private key ‘shards’, and other measures designed to reduce the risk of the loss or theft of the Issuer’s bitcoin. However, these cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or force majeure event that may be experienced by the Issuer or the Custodian… Crypto asset platforms are often unregulated in nature and may be vulnerable to manipulative trading activity, business failure, fraud and security breaches. In addition, if a crypto asset platform which a Series of Securities utilises for storage, trading and/or settlement becomes insolvent this may lead to a loss of the Issuer’s underlying assets and therefore a loss for the relevant Security holders. Crypto assets may be subject to attacks by malicious actors or groups of actors. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining on the Bitcoin network, it may be able to alter the Bitcoin blockchain on which transactions in bitcoin rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner or at all (a ‘51% attack’). To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Bitcoin network, or the Bitcoin community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the Bitcoin blockchain may not be possible. There have been a number of examples of 51% attacks on cryptocurrencies. …there is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding Bitcoin, which is estimated to be reached by approximately the year 2140, will not be changed. If a hard fork changing the 21 million supply cap is widely adopted, the limit on the supply of Bitcoin could be lifted, which could have an adverse impact on the value of bitcoin and the value of the Securities. The cryptography underlying bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. Any resulting reduction in the integrity of, or confidence in, the source code or cryptography underlying crypto assets generally could negatively affect the demand for crypto assets and therefore may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and consequently the value of the Securities. Some developers may also be funded by entities whose interests are at odds with the interests of other participants in the Bitcoin network or with the interests of investors in bitcoin. A bad actor could also seek to interfere with the operation of the Bitcoin network by attempting to exercise a malign influence over a core developer. There is currently no tax certainty regarding the treatment of investments in crypto assets across various jurisdictions due to the novelty of the asset class. Accordingly, the taxation of the crypto assets and associated investments can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be subject to change, potentially also with retroactive effect. Any change in the tax treatment of the crypto assets could result in the Issuer incurring additional taxes… …and there’s plenty more where that came from. I’m not even getting into the regulatory risk, or the uncertainty over whether the issuer could legally enforce its claim to the ETN’s crypto collateral held with third-parties. Really, you could replace all 23,867 words in the prospectus’ risk section with the legend: AAAAARGH! Or as the issuer succinctly puts it: Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. Okay, let’s turn now to something more relaxing. Tax. A crypto ETN does not pay an income. Thus the only tax to worry about is capital gains – payable if you hold the product outside of your tax shelters. Also, if the ETN is domiciled outside of the UK then check it has reporting fund status. If not then capital gains will be taxed at income tax rates when you sell. That could hurt! Note that this reporting fund stuff doesn’t apply if you’ve safely stashed your ETN in an ISA or SIPP. When comparing crypto ETNs, look for: Cost of ownership – What’s the TER, bid-offer spreads, tracking difference? Collateral – What assets are held as collateral, how much is held versus the value of the product, are there daily disclosures, is the collateral insured and independently audited? The custodian – Is the keeper of the collateral independent and reputable? Securities lending policy – Can the collateral be lent out? That would invite yet more counterparty risk. Asset protection – Is the crypto mostly held offline in cold storage? Are the ETN’s assets segregated from other parties? Product structure – Is the ETN backed by physical cryptocurrency or another asset, or does it use synthetic replication (that is, swap-based derivatives)? Physical is usually safer. Price index – Google it. Is this index reputable? Does it definitely track the crypto’s spot price? ETN leverage – Look for a 1:1 ratio to ensure you’re getting a non-leveraged product. (Unless you actually want leverage, you complete and utter nutter.) Tax – Can I hold the product in my ISA or SIPP? If not, does it have reporting fund status? Early redemption, default, and failure – What does the prospectus say about these scenarios? Obviously none of this is investing advice. We’re just running through things to think about should you decide you want to research these new offerings for yourself. Personally, I can’t say I’m about to sink my life savings into crypto. But I will follow along with interest. I think crypto is an astounding phenomenon but I have grave doubts about its worth as an asset class in a wider portfolio. Of course, my views are neither here nor there. And even the FCA has caved to the inevitable, because swathes of Brits were opting to take their chances in unregulated offshore exchanges. Not to mention the various other crypto-powered vehicles that had crept onto the market. Is this progress? I don’t know. But I am fascinated. Take it steady, The Accumulator Thanks for reading!

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Thanks very much for the detailed breakdown TA, I will stay away from crypto myself for many reasons but good luck to those who jump on board . TFJ @TA – thanks for this. Might be worth 1 or 2% of my SIPP, carved out of the gold allocation… Maybe. Blimey. I thought crypto was bad enough as it is before you stir in all this obfuscation into the pot. You can buy crypto on the open market. You can store it in a cold wallet, which you can back up the bejesus out of it. I hold gold via ETCs. The downsides to holding physical gold are obvious. And they just don’t apply to crypto. Buy your crypto and transfer to a cold wallet. Back up enough times as gives you peace of mind, sort of like the first pics of your newborn. Some in cloud, some printed. Now you have a bearer store of value – the greatest value of crypto is that you can run with it. I find no temptation to hold crypto with an ETN – it’s all added counterparty risk. I have to admit I don’t hold mine in a cold wallet yet, but that is because I am building up a position and it’s only £3k now, so I am good with coinbase and accept the risk. > And even the FCA has caved to the inevitable, because swathes of Brits were opting to take their chances in unregulated offshore exchanges. I’m not sure this is any sort of an improvement. It’s like a flawed sword that fails you in your hour of need. Buy it on the open market and you know you are in a nest of vipers, spivs and dodgy geezers, and it’s up to you to take life-changing amounts offline and keep them offline. What exactly is the FCA protecting you from that you couldn’t do yourself, we know here be dragons, adding a load more indirection and ways to crap out that they won’t protect you from strikes me as bonkers. There’s a delightful honesty to > Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. and the FCA hasn’t helped you with that one iota by adding even more ways to screw up and more counterparties to make off with the loot. Buying bitcoin needn’t be so damn complicated. It is inherently dodgy, because of all the risks to the underlying system which is not 100% understood, for all I know the ghost of Satoshi’s wallet may one day hold the entire edifice to ransom, and advances in computing could blow the whole thing up. Adding even more dodginess to the existing dodginess and calling is FCA approved dodginess + is bonkers. For the love of God, why? So maybe the small Alternatives section of the portfolio will now be: – SGLN – CMFP – IBIT or BTIP? Who knew!? We once held consoles so don’t be so mean. Think we sold at £30…..great investment we inherited there. Excellent piece. Thank you @TA. It had to happen. Usually, a thematic ETF launch is a sign of a big top, and an attempt to create exit liquidity for early investors. But here, with crypto, it’s our flat footed FCA who are to finger for the timing. At the time of the FCA ban on 6 October 2020 the price of Bitcoin was about £8,200. Today it is ~£84,000. Half a hand clap there for protecting consumers! What really caught my eye though is how this regulatory shift opens doors to hybrids like the 21Shares Bitcoin and Gold ETP (ticker BOLD, currently Zurich listed). While you rightly compare pure crypto ETNs to a wild ride, echoing your “AAAAARGH!” on the prospectus risks, BOLD feels like a more tempered option for diversification hungry passives like me. It’s physically backed, blending Bitcoin’s growth potential with gold’s potential inflation hedging stability via monthly inverse volatility rebalancing (around 60/40 split lately). It’s a nod to Ray Dalio’s all-weather portfolio ethos, where gold acts as a ballast against Bitcoin’s volatility swings. It’s not FSCS protected, and those operational risks and frictions (Blockchain fees, custody issues) all apply in spades, but the 0.65% TER is ‘competitive”in this space, and its performance since 2022 (over 130% cumulative) shows some resilience in choppy markets. For fellow passives, BOLD could possibly be a part of that 5-10% satellite allocation to less / negatively / uncorrelated assets; enhancing diversification without upending a core equity index tracking approach. I’m not all in with it, or crypto more generally, though, and your skepticism here resonates. But in a world of persistent inflation, deficits and fiat doubts, maybe it’s worth a look. I do have to say though that, IMO, there’s a massively underated (and under thought through) growing risk in relation to Blockchains like Bitcoin’s from quantum computing advances. I’ve commented on this before on Monevator, but here’s a recent YouTube piece covering this ground: https://youtu.be/HKcVpZIsP6k?feature=shared The TL:DR (with timestamps) is that quantum computers could deduce private keys from public keys, allowing attackers to steal funds from existing wallets [36:57]. Older, dormant wallets, including the legendary stash of Satoshi, are particularly vulnerable because their public keys are already exposed on the Blockchain [37:06]. Upgrading a decentralized network like Bitcoin requires global consensus, which is a slow and challenging process given the networks decentralisation and diversity [58:22] necessitating a “hard fork,” that could divide the community and prevent a timely enough decision [01:23:57]. Millions of existing wallets, especially older ones whose public keys are already exposed, cannot be retroactively updated, remaining permanently vulnerable [00:39:50] Transitioning the entire digital infrastructure of BTC is akin to replacing the nervous system of civilization mid-flight [01:25:03]. Despite repeated warnings, the crypto ecosystem still lacks any sense of urgency, viewing the threat as distant or inconvenient. Yet the consensus from experts (Gartner analysts estimate a 50% chance of disruption by 2037 [49:59]) and major financial institutions like BlackRock (who are massively involved in crypto ETPs) is that the quantum computing threat to Blockchain is real, and increasingly near term [01:09:06]. Thanks for the thorough breakdown; it’s armed me to tread (exceeding) carefully after 8th October! Here be dragons … and their treasure (maybe). @DeltaHedge #6 > BOLD – 50:50 gold:BTC, 0.65% OCF Oy vey, truly we are in the End Times. For starters, why 50:50? Secondly go git yourself the gold ETC from any of the ones listed here at 0.12% and match with your preferred ration of BTC bought straight off, and save yourself 0.55% fees. Job done. I share the BTC computing advance worry. As the man said > Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. IMO you only need some BTC to leaven the mix, 50:50 is way too much BTC IMO. But I suppose if you are a GenZ moonshotter, well, the sky’s the limit @ermine #8: yep, it ain’t cheap, but you can’t really fairly compare it to a plain vanilla gold or even to a Bitcoin ETP. Allocation is fully dynamic on this one – rebalances monthly using an inverse volatility weighting mechanism to equal risk exposure (i.e., higher volatility assets like Bitcoin get a lower weight, but this adapts as the relative share of volatility between gold and Bitcoin changes). As of 22nd September, allocation was approx 62% Bitcoin and 38% gold (this fluctuates; earlier reports, from when Bitcoin was relatively more volatile, sometimes reference 25% Bitcoin / 75% gold split, but it’s not fixed). Your nearest fee comparator is perhaps an active fund (get out the garlic and the silver crosses on that one!) or something quanty. Fascinating (worrying?) how something ostensibly so easy in which to dabble can have such complex issues. I think my attraction to diversification is overtaken by simply not understanding this well enough, even with this excellent piece, thanks @TA. Maybe no current need for impenetrably complex asset classes for a GenZ moonshot – even in its pre-retirement de-risked state, portfolio is zooming! A bit frothy perhaps, but at least a risk I can get my head round. As I mentioned on a previous post – this is the FCA doing what they do – ineptly making sure retail don’t have the opportunity to make money. Crypto bad at $12000 per BTC. We protect you from this volatile instrument Crypto fine at $120000 per BTC. Fill your boots. I’ve held the Ethereum ETN since 2017 in my sipp. The last ban coincided with the very start of the pandemic bull run. I had wanted to buy the BTC one. But no. HL even slapped it with an immediate ban on purchase in Oct 2020 prior to the fca actually stopping it. “The FCA have said it’s unsafe”. You what?! I screamed at them down the phone for doing so but was too lazy to move my sipp. They did the same with Rhodium under the guise of not having a KID for the deutschebank etf, coincidentally just before the 2018 bull run. Fortunately I’d bought some prior. Jokers. It bears saying again. They are perfectly fine with people buying stocks that can go to zero. I’ve bought plenty over the years. No protection – and neither did I want any. Let us make our own choices. Excellent – thank you. Crypto not really my thing, but as you say interesting to follow, and anyway this is not really about Crypto, but about ETNs – makes sense but had no idea the tracking was so bad! Hadn’t seen this elsewhere so really great to have all this info laid out. Thanks for the article. I enjoy reading about crypto and at the same time I have no desire to touch it with my own money, The FT has an interesting article about companies pivoting to holding crypto and buying back their own shares https://www.ft.com/content/573be235-56a6-4556-90af-a8eac887dbf9 It’ll all end in tears, it’s just the next dodgy financial product waiting to reel in unsuspecting investors before it goes bust. > The cryptography underlying bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. > Any resulting reduction in the integrity of, or confidence in, the source code or cryptography underlying crypto assets generally could negatively affect the demand for crypto assets and therefore may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and consequently the value of the Securities. I agree with Delta Hedge with regards to the vulnerability of Bitcoin to quantum computing attacks, and appreciate The Accumulator bringing it up in the article. Also smart for iShares to enumerate it, though wording it as “could become ineffective” rather than “will soon become ineffective” strikes me as undeservedly optimistic. Right now, bitcoin is like a company with ~30% free floating shares. When quantum computing attacks release assets from all the wallets whose owners have lost the keys, the float will go up, depressing prices. When some of the actively held wallets get drained, there will be less demand for buying leaky buckets and it will be a fun show to watch. On the other hand, quantum bitcoin miners could reduce the energy footprint Etherium has previously had a hard fork to reverse a hack – they might have more direction with the creator (Vitalik Butlerin) still involved in attempting to transition to Post-Quantum Cryptograpthy, but I don’t envy their chances @ermine (or anyone else who has experience of buying bitcoin!). Could I perhaps ask you a question as you seem to have a handle on bitcoin. I purchased a small chunk many years ago. It has been on my to do list to look at buying more as a diversifier. I hold with blockchain. When I look to purchase via blockchain a £100 purchase has fees (and perhaps a spread) of £2.99 (2.9%). A purchase of £1200 would have fees of £41.88 (£3.39%). Similar quotes on my coinbase app (which I have not purchased through yet) are £100 @ £3.89 and £1200 @ £46.00. Is this typical of the level of fees I would have to incur to buy bitcoin direct? Or am I missing something…. This is great @TA – the list of risks is an actually a good route in to better understanding of crypto generally. EG 51% attack! @ermine your comments make sense to me too. And thanks to @delta hedge for excellent further elaboration. Thanks again for covering this topic @Pikolo — Hi! You write: Also smart for iShares to enumerate it, though wording it as “could become ineffective” rather than “will soon become ineffective” strikes me as undeservedly optimistic. I suppose this is because iShares have lawyers drafting legal documents, rather than the rather lower bar of us anonymous commenters on the Internet… 😉 From what I’ve read the consensus of quantum computing really threatening cryptography ranges from 15 years away to ‘never’ which would seem to give plenty of time for Bitcoin to transition to a post-quantum cryptography world *if* required. There should be plenty of signposts along the way, too, given the apparent challenges of scaling quantum computers. Moore’s Law doesn’t seem to apply, at least pending some kind of novel breakthrough. Of course ‘will’ might still arguably apply in my more optimistic scenario, but then there’s a lot of ‘wills’ that we don’t write into legal documents. My house will eventually crumble, and the Earth will be consumed by the sun. Not for me to worry about though. 😉 Also, we have to understand that a quantum computing world with genuinely useful compute-at-scale would be upending cryptography (and much else besides) all over the place, IMHO. It wouldn’t be a niche sideshow for crypto blogs and social media timelines like today. TLDR: I think Bitcoin has time to adapt, and I don’t see why 51% of those who control the network wouldn’t move to do so if required. @Ian #16 I took a look at my last Coinbase (advanced platform) transaction for BTC in GBP, placed at 9/19/25 21:59, filled at 06:59 the next day 0.00133763 BTC for £84,798.17 subtotal £113.43 fee 0.40 (I am post only, I do not allow taker) total £114.83 > Similar quotes on my coinbase app (which I have not purchased through yet) are £100 @ £3.89 I am an old git and I don’t use apps, and very definitely not for finance, I use the web interface. But this looks very high for coinbase. Have you switched to CB pro on the app – Coinbase regular does have high fees, I didn’t realise they are that high Now this is Bitcoin, so there are many areas where spivs can take you for a ride. Coinbase may be offering a poorer rate than other exchanges at any instant in time and finessing fees there. It’s hard to determine, given the shocking volatility. Cryptoradar shows the best exchange for any asset. I do not want a relationship with more than one exchange, the more people have your details the more chance of spivs hacking them. If/when I have a worrying amount on an excahnge I will bump the BTC into a cold wallet. IMO crypto is definitely something that should be held at the very end of your bargepole, and I only do BTC and ETH, mainly BTC. And I am mustelid, not whale, in the size of the holding, because in gold I trust. I have direct wallet experience in another cryptoasset, and the feeling I get there is that fees are higher for small transactions I did find the BOLD concept interesting, that’s BTC and gold. I can’t find the reference now, but basically BTC is a risk-on asset and gold isrisk-off fear, all other things being equal, which they aren’t at the moment. A small amount of BTC (~5-10% max) as a proportion of a gold + BTC has some merit, particularly if you rebalance it every so often – monthly seemed the target. I am not sure I CBA with that, but I have a paltry BTC holding, probably much less than yours as I am Johnny-come-lately, I was in then out, and more recently in with the BOLD idea. I am not the typical Monevator reader though, because I have reached where I want to be and have flicked the engines to cruise. Nobody who is trying to make their fortune should hold large amounts of non-productive stores of value. I hold about half in equities which is probably low round here. I absolutely respect TI/TAs right to kick this comment very far into touch as it’s dangerously active in a pretty dangerous asset class. Perhaps this was in the post and I overlooked it, but can anyone tell me why an ETN – which seems a rather complicated financial instrument – allowed but a straightforward ETF equivalent to SGLN is not? EDIT: I’ve just spotted that SGLN is an ETC not an ETF, so perhaps that’s also complicated and I just didn’t know! Not my area of expertise by any means (!), but is there any risk that Crypto ETNs, being debt securities, are treated by HMRC as deeply discounted securities for UK tax purposes, such that the entirety of any net return is taxed as income (and not as capital gains) outside a tax free wrapper? Probably nonsense but grateful for any thoughts. @Steve Lemon #20 I’ve held SGLN in the past and HL tells you that you can hold it in an ISA, SIPP or LISA. As you say it is an ETC, but a refreshing simplicity compared to this ETN. @TI #18: That’s a thoughtful and well-articulated argument for optimism, but…. ​ What about harvest now, decrypt later? Even if the breakthrough is 15 years away, encrypted data (including Bitcoin public keys from older wallets) can be collected today and stored. Once a powerful quantum computer is operational, those keys can be cracked retroactively, immediately emptying millions of coins, including Satoshi’s. This vulnerability can’t be patched. ​The assumption that the Bitcoin community will quickly agree to a hard fork for survival may be optimistic given past difficulties. The transition to a post-quantum algorithm would require a complex, consensus driven network (10,000+ nodes) upgrade. The debate to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit), which involved a much less radical change than a fundamental crypto-system swap (and was part of a compromise solution to double the effective block size from 1MB to ~2MB), took over three years of intense, acrimonious public debate before it achieved its lock in signal in mid-2017. There’s no small well coordinated aligned group with 51% of the hashing power who can push this through. This is maybe more akin to the situation with CDOs and RMBS in the run up to the GFC, where the banks failed to act in their own (and their own shareholders’ and senior employees’) self interests, despite a fair few voices pointing out well in advance (although admittedly, and ironically, a bit too early as it turns out) that the whole house of cards would topple. ​ While the consensus on quantum computing timelines is indeed wide, the defense must be 100% successful and proactive. The attacker only needs one successful, secret breakthrough to compromise the system before the slow, global consensus process completes. This is an existential threat, not merely one of many. The current security of a multi trillion dollar asset cannot rely on the hope that a catastrophic breakthrough adheres to a predictable signpost schedule giving the many disparate parties involved time to agree all aspects of the fundamental changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. In contrast, the board of a centralised commercial institution like a bank or a fund platform could move PDQ if required to implement post quantum cryptography. FWIW, my guess is that someone like North Korea’s now infamous Lazarus Group would, in the future, try and execute a heist / disruption Op like this, possibly with either active PRC assistance or their wilful blindness (Lazarus have been behind some of the very biggest and most challenging recent crypto hacks/thefts – they’re a front for the Reconnaissance General Bureau of the General Staff Department of the Korean Peoples’ Army and, it’s fair to say, are pretty hardcore and deep under the radar when it comes to these sorts of mischief). @TI “.. I think Bitcoin has time to adapt..”. The great thing about gold is that it doesn’t need to adapt. It’s elemental. Bitcoin, crypto.., is just a mathematical construct that will need lots of shape-shifting over time. Every time I think of bitcoin, the tech bros, and agent orange…, a huge “Uh.., no thanks..”, appears in my mind. “Meanwhile the rest of this article will help you go into all this with your eyes wide open.” Oh no it won’t. I remember the old Canadian joke: “A gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar standing next to it”. Softly softly flee from monkey. on a tangent, but similar in the entertainment level for people who enjoy watching crazy geopolitical gambling in etf price form: https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/j/jpmorgan-emerging-europe,-middle-east-and-afr (this is JEMA, the EM tracker that was about 80% Russia before 2022, note the premium/discount situation, and its correlation to Trump activity) @DH – thanks for the heads up on BOLD. Looks interesting. BTW, I think you got the allocations the wrong way round. Just checked and last update was 69% Gold, 31% BTC. Opps. Yep typo. My bad. Thanks @Algernond #27 for spotting. BTC seems to be going through an uncharacteristic low vol spell. This is usually either very good or very bad in terms of price action (what a tradable signal that one is ehh 😉 ). So I’d expect Gold to be a higher percentage of the BOLD ETN mix normally. Having said that, BTC *should* become less volatile as its returns diminish over time (even if it continues up on price).

Title: Ethereum price forecast: analysts reveal shocking targets after the $1.5B liquidation bloodbath
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/ethereum-price-forecast-analysts-reveal-shocking-targets-after-the-1-5b-liquidation-bloodbath/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T14:35:22Z
Full Content:
Ethereum price plunged into a violent sell-off on Monday, wiping out many leveraged long positions and rattling traders. Ethereum’s price has, however, rebounded slightly, with CoinGecko showing ETH trading around $4,197, with a 24-hour range near $4,125–$4,220 at press time. On Monday, Ethereum (ETH) fell roughly 15% alongside other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), triggering $1.5 billion in liquidations — the largest single event in six months. BIGGEST LIQUIDATION CASCADE EVER OVER $1B IN LONGS WIPED OUT IN A SINGLE HOUR THE REAL BLOODBATH 🩸 pic.twitter.com/3MPOw56O48 — AlΞx Wacy 🌐 (@wacy_time1) September 22, 2025 The sudden drop forced many leveraged long positions to close and pushed ETH toward a key psychological floor around $4,000. The price decline came even as institutional demand continued. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF registered roughly $512 million of inflows during the same sell-off, underscoring a divide between retail pressure and institutional accumulation. Technically, the market looks fragile. ETH recently broke a symmetrical triangle, a move that gives a measured downside target near $3,560 if selling persists. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has flagged the $3,550–$3,750 area as a likely support zone, and he noted that the 20-week EMA sits close to $3,685. I think that we'll see some more chop occur on $ETH. I don't know whether we'll dip as deep as $3,550-3,750, but I'm sure that we'll start to see: – 20-Week MA is getting closer. – Compression is building up –> Big move to occur at a later time. It's now down nearly 20% from… pic.twitter.com/MUvUEYY4Xv — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 23, 2025 Short-term resistance bands now cluster between about $4,220 and $4,360. Below that, traders are watching $4,120, $4,050 and the critical $4,000 level. A decisive break under those supports could accelerate the decline toward roughly $3,800. Conversely, a clean bounce and a decisive close above the 50-day EMA near $4,250 would improve the odds of a sustained recovery. A second technical pattern of concern is a descending triangle that formed after August’s peak near $4,956. That structure keeps $4,070 as a make-or-break pivot. If $4,070 holds, the path to a retest of $5,000 reopens; if it fails, downside to $3,800 becomes more likely. On the bullish side, a string of analysts and macro studies argue that today’s weakness could set the stage for aggressive gains. Ted Pillows applied the Global M2 Money Supply chart to Ethereum and suggested a scenario that lands ETH between $18,000 and $20,000 by 2026. Global M2 supply is now projecting $18,000-$20,000 ETH by cycle top. Even if $ETH pulls half of that, it'll trade above $10,000. I'm still long-term bullish on Ethereum and think that a sweep of the $4,000 liquidity zone could happen before reversal. pic.twitter.com/w6ZZl0OuPI — Ted (@TedPillows) September 21, 2025 Other market voices back more modest but still impressive rallies. Daan de Rover and Fundstrat’s Mark Newton highlight a $5,500 target, with Newton adding that ETH is unlikely to drop much below $4,000. Institutional commitments have reinforced that sentiment; combined flows from large managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity reached hundreds of millions, a dynamic many analysts say supports higher prices over time. In addition, Crypto GEMs point to Wyckoff Accumulation scenarios and chart setups that could take ETH toward $7,000 if a spring and test sequence holds. Michaël van de Poppe himself argues that compression is building and that dips around current levels represent attractive accumulation opportunities for long-term buyers. Key datapoints to monitor are liquidity below $4,000, ETF inflows, and whether the 50-day EMA around $4,250 is reclaimed. Ethereum sits at a crossroads. The near term is binary: hold above $4,000 and bulls can chase higher targets; lose that floor and technical setups point to a deeper correction toward the mid-$3,000s. Longer term, robust institutional flows, tokenisation trends, and macro easing provide clear bullish arguments — some analysts even see five-figure and double-digit-thousand outcomes on the horizon. Traders and investors should watch liquidity, ETF flows, and moving-average confirmations to decide which path unfolds next.

Title: Thinking Small Drives Big Leaps In AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/23/thinking-small-drives-big-leaps-in-ai/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T14:23:41Z

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. AI is an increasingly popular topic in the investment industry – for good reason. From its ability (or lack thereof) to facilitate investment research or pick winning stocks, the potential applications are broad. Like it or not, it’s clear that AI is going to change the investment industry in a big way. It started, mostly with hype, years ago, but there is more and more progress with each passing day. Some of the largest asset managers have already incorporated AI into their active ETFs. BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset manager in the world, provides an early case study. BlackRock first integrated AI/machine learning into active ETFs back in 2018 with the suite of ETFs under the “iShares Evolved” brand. This product line consisted of seven new funds which would pick holdings in industries based on machine learning and natural language processing. While the concept seemed promising, the results were not. Five of the seven funds were liquidated in 2022. Of the remaining 2 ETFs, only one has outperformed the S&P 500 since inception. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the outperforming ETF, now named iShares U.S. Tech Independence Focused ETF (IETC), focused on the high-flying tech sector. Why the lack of success? AI doesn’t perform well if it is fed poor training data. Whenever AI is involved, especially in a complex field like investing, the quality of the training data is the single most important factor to its success. Keep in mind that AI learns from its training data. It doesn’t know if its training data is wrong. It trusts it blindly. Unfortunately for users, current large language models (LLMs) fail miserably at understanding the meaning and nuances of financial data in filings because it has been trained using low quality financial data. Any stock picking or investment research system built on these models is using bad data, and everyone knows the timeless saying about models: garbage in – garbage out. If the financial models used to train the AI can’t generate alpha, AI isn’t going to do any better. AI isn’t a magic bullet. It cannot fix the data on which it is built. It’s a tool to replicate the work that human analysts do, but at scale. In fact, AI may perform worse than humans because it doesn’t have access to additional data on which its human counterparts rely on without realizing it. If big asset managers like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton (BEN), Invesco (IVZ), and others can’t find high-quality data to drive their AI solutions, I believe their stocks will face downward pressure. The only way for asset managers to differentiate their funds and hope to outperform the market more consistently is to leverage superior data to drive superior research. Otherwise, their only real differentiator is distribution, an advantage that has long been exhausted. There’s no better proof that the quality of training data is paramount to AI’s success than the mounting evidence that small language models (SLM) significantly outperform LLMs. The problem with LLMs is that they tend to rely heavily on the open internet for training, which is a data source filled with noise and inaccuracies. Traditional asset managers would never train human analysts by directing them to learn about investing by only reading the internet. Why anyone is training their AI analysts this way is unclear. As a result, these LLMs handle a broad range of general tasks reasonably well, but their performance declines sharply when faced with more sophisticated tasks. In contrast, SLMs focus on a narrower and more specific domain, which enables human experts to ensure the data is accurate and properly organized and that the rules about how to use the data produce reliable results. For example, the SLM created by New Constructs powers market-beating stock picking. I’m able to empirically prove the accuracy and reliability of the SLM because it is based on: I think the advantages of SLMs over LLMs are intuitive. Rather than trying to boil the ocean like LLMs, they narrow the scope to a small enough domain where human experts can truly curate a pristine dataset on which clear instructions can be built to produce truly reliable and human-expert level insights. See Figure 1, from this tweet, for a basic comparison of SLMs and LLMs. Figure 1: Comparing Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs)

Title: JPMorgan To Appear At Ripple Swell: What We Know So Far
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-ripple-swell/

The XRP community’s rumor mill just met hard evidence: Ripple’s official Swell speaker roster now lists Scott Lucas, Head of Markets Digital Assets at JP Morgan, among this year’s presenters. Swell 2025 will take place in New York City on November 4–5 (welcome reception on November 3) at Convene Hudson Yards, with Ripple billing it as its ninth annual gathering of “leaders in crypto, blockchain, payments and policy.” JPMorgan’s appearance is part of a broader Wall Street tilt to the agenda. The same speakers page shows Maxwell Stein (Director, Digital Assets, BlackRock), Ryan Rugg (Global Head of Digital Assets, Treasury & Trade Solutions, Citi), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Head of Fidelity Digital Asset Management, Fidelity), and Kim Hochfeld (Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash, Digital & Securities Lending, State Street Investment Management). The published agenda assigns Stein to a capital-markets tokenization discussion with Moody’s, and pairs Rugg and Lo Bessette on a panel about how global banks are shaping digital assets at scale. As of publication, Lucas’s specific session was not listed on the agenda. Lineups are subject to change, but the current program underlines heavyweight TradFi participation. The listing triggered predictable chatter on X. James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) amplified the update with: “Now JPMorgan is going to be at Ripple Swell? 🍿” Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) went further, asserting: “JPMorgan put their Head of Digital Assets on stage at Ripple Swell 2025. XRP is fully integrated into the banking infrastructure … adoption is inevitable.” Those are community interpretations, not confirmations of product integrations or partnerships; the only verifiable fact at this point is Lucas’s inclusion on Ripple’s official speaker slate. Lucas’s remit at JP Morgan is directly relevant to what Swell typically explores. He oversees the strategy and execution of new trading products built on DLT/blockchain and represents the bank in industry initiatives; he also holds board roles at HQLAx and Ownera, and serves on the board of CLS Group—all touchpoints in the market plumbing of tokenized collateral, securities finance and post-trade. Context matters: JPMorgan has built one of the industry’s most advanced permissioned-blockchain stacks for wholesale finance. Its Onyx (now Kinexys Digital Assets) platforms span JPM Coin and tokenized-collateral rails used in repo and liquidity operations; recent milestones include tokenized MMF collateral and on-chain intraday repo workflows. That program has processed large volumes and is expanding to third-party apps—developments that dovetail with Swell’s tokenization and market-infrastructure themes. None of this implies an XRP integration; it does explain why a senior JP Morgan digital-assets executive belongs in the conversation Swell curates. What to watch from here is straightforward. First, Swell’s New York program already confirms BlackRock’s tokenization talk and a joint Citi–Fidelity panel on bank adoption—useful signaling about where institutional priorities sit in late 2025. Second, keep an eye on the agenda for a named session involving JPMorgan’s Lucas; as of now, only his speaker listing is public. At press time, XRP traded at $2.86.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves will declare the UK ‘open for business’, following a £110 billion investment surge from major financial services firms in the past week alone. Global fintech leader Revolut will today (23 September) open its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, setting out plans to invest £3 billion in the UK and create 1,000 high-skilled jobs over the next five years. This comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from leading US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 new jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. The wave of investment from financial services companies comes just months after the Chancellor cut needless financial red tape to ensure the UK wins the global race for financial services investment as part of the modern industrial strategy. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said: The UK is well and truly open for business under this government. Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change. Nik Storonsky, CEO and Co-founder of Revolut, commented: Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers. To power that journey from our home market, we are investing £3 billion in the UK over the next five years. This commitment will not only create 1,000 new jobs but will also fuel the innovation from our London hub that will help us deliver on our global ambitions. The major investments from financial services firms over the past week include: These investments in the UK are a vote of confidence in the UK’s economic plan, built on stability, investment and reform. The Leeds Reforms set out the widest ranging reforms to financial regulation in over a decade, making the UK more attractive to global financial services firms. This includes new support for fintech introducing tailored support to help FinTechs, with new start-ups getting a single regulatory point of contact to help them through the scale-up phase. The contact will be able to provide technical support to help them understand the regulatory requirements they need to meet in order to grow. Revolut’s investment marks its commitment to the UK, where it has grown to become a global fintech leader with more than 10,000 employees and revenues of over £3 billion. The company now serves over 65 million customers worldwide, including 12 million in the UK, and has set its sights on reaching 100 million customers globally by mid 2027. Revolut’s success exemplifies the strength of the UK’s fintech sector, which boasts around 3,000 firms supporting tens of thousands of skilled jobs nationwide.

Vardoulakis A blockchain is a distributed database where independent computers across the world maintain identical copies of a transaction record, updating it only when the network reaches consensus on new transactions—making the history transparent and extraordinarily difficult to alter. Historically, bonds have traded almost entirely in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, while equities and money market fund shares have largely settled through centralized infrastructures such as stock exchanges and central securities depositories. In both settings, each institution maintains its own records, and post-trade steps like confirmation, clearing, and settlement require multiple intermediaries and repeated reconciliation. Blockchain offers a different model: instead of fragmented books or a single central authority, all participants share a single, consensus-validated ledger of ownership and transactions. A tokenized asset—whether a bond, equity, or money market fund share—is a digital representation of that claim on the blockchain, with transfers recorded as direct updates to this shared ledger. While distributed ledgers are not inherently faster or cheaper than centralized systems, they differ in important ways: no single entity controls the record; programmable logic can automate corporate actions or enforce transfer restrictions; and auditability is native through an append-only history. In this way, blockchain replaces bilateral and centrally governed recordkeeping with a common ledger that is jointly maintained and verifiable in real time. While many types of assets have been tokenized to date, we focus on the tokenization of “money-like” investment funds that potentially allow for novel use cases. We provide a background of how these products have evolved and discuss their use cases. In a subsequent post, we examine the benefits and risks to financial stability from these products. Many types of assets have been tokenized to date, including real estate, commodities, agriculture, and other financial securities. But the bulk of tokenization activity in the United States has concentrated on two types of funds: money market funds (MMFs), which are open-end funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), and private funds that are exempt from registration under that Act. Several private funds have been proposed by large financial institutions, suggesting surging interest among market participants and the possibility of wider adoption. Private funds are exempt from many of the requirements in federal securities laws and regulations applicable to MMFs, including the 1940 Act’s disclosure requirements for investment companies. As a result, regulators and the public have little visibility into their operations, including whether they have instituted the same type of liquidity risk management tools as MMFs are required to implement (for example, portfolio maturity maximums and liquid asset minimums). Three prominent tokenized MMFs are Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX (AUM $708M), Circle/Hashnote’s USYC ($488M) and WisdomTree’s WTGXX ($10.8M); the largest tokenized private fund is BlackRock’s BUIDL (AUM $2.5B). The chart below shows the growth of these four tokenized funds. Total Assets Under Management of Select Tokenized Funds Three prominent use cases of tokenized funds have been developed to date, all of which are novel as they have historically not been available to investment funds due to numerous legal, regulatory, and/or market reasons. See, for example, “Lessons from the History of the U.S. Regulatory Perimeter” for how the legal perimeter has evolved in the United States, separating deposit liabilities, which are considered legal payment instruments, from other types such as investment funds’ liabilities, which are not. Use Case I: Development of a Secondary Market and Instantaneous Liquidity Pools Investors may want to hold tokenized shares beyond their traditional function as a store of value. For example, tokenization allows shares to circulate as a medium of exchange in secondary markets. Such a possibility would be facilitated by innovative efforts to offer immediate liquidity against tokenized shares. For instance, some fund issuers have established processes by which their tokenized shares can be exchanged for more widely used means of digital-asset payments, namely stablecoins. A prominent example is the smart-contract-controlled pool where BUIDL and FOBXX are instantaneously exchangeable for USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin by market capitalization. These initiatives enable a deeper integration of tokenized funds with the digital-asset ecosystem, thereby increasing benefits to investors of tokenized funds, as they can use their shares to transact in ways historically unavailable to such shares. Use Case II: Reserve Asset for DeFi-based Products Tokenization can also facilitate the use of the shares to be used as a store of value in the digital-asset ecosystem. For example, at least three DeFi-based products use BUIDL as a reserve asset. One such product is Ondo Finance’s “Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries” (OUSG). Recently, Ondo announced it would exchange shares of OUSG for shares in four tokenized MMFs (FOBXX, WTGXX, and two international funds). Ondo plans to then hold the acquired shares as part of OUSG’s reserve assets which are predominantly made up of BUIDL. In essence, OUSG serves as an example of the secondary market functionality discussed above with an increased role for tokenized shares to be a store of value in the digital-asset ecosystem, while also providing additional liquidity for token holders given the 24/7 on-off ramp in which tokenized funds can be indirectly exchanged for stablecoins. While Ondo could have used stablecoins as collateral directly, this would have been less attractive as a store of value since stablecoins do not pay interest. In addition, both Mountain Protocol’s stablecoin and the rebranded FRAX stablecoin claim that BUIDL comprises a portion of their reserve assets. Use Case III: Collateral for Derivatives A third use case for tokenized shares is posting margins for repurchase agreements and derivatives transactions. Bloomberg reports that two of the world’s largest crypto prime brokers allow clients, including hedge funds, to use BlackRock’s BUIDL as collateral for crypto-based derivatives trading and are in early talks with some of the world’s largest crypto exchanges to expand this offering. Moreover, Circle recently purchased Hashnote, the issuer of the world’s largest tokenized MMF to “emerge as a preferred form of yield-bearing collateral on crypto exchanges, and also with custodians and prime brokers.” Meanwhile, in traditional derivatives, JPMorgan Chase facilitated a transaction in which tokenized BlackRock MMF shares were pledged as collateral with Barclays for a derivatives contract, although there haven’t been any additional transactions to date. It is too early to tell what impact, if any, tokenized shares will have on the financial system. Thus far tokenized shares have been mainly facilitating use cases within the digital-asset ecosystem. While there exists a lot of opacity in how these tokenized funds are being used as well as limited evidence of broader acceptance so far, interconnections between the traditional financial system and digital assets could increase if these products are used more broadly by market participants in the future.

The feature was enabled through a smart contract, which now serves as another off-ramp for products offered by asset managers BlackRock and VanEck, according to a press release. It functions 24/7, allowing users to access instant liquidity, Ripple added. Ripple’s stablecoin debuted in December. And although it’s much smaller than alternatives offered by Tether and Circle, RLUSD has grown to a market capitalization of $740 million within the past year, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. In a statement, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple, described the move as a “natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” noting that RLUSD was designed specifically for institutional use. Securitize made a similar announcement nearly a year ago, saying that Circle’s USDC had been integrated into its platform as a way to reduce investment costs and streamline the subscription process for investing in BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). BlackRock’s BUDIL is worth $2 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. Around 90 qualified investors hold shares in the fund, which is tokenized on several blockchains, including Solana, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, and layer-2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL), which can also be exchanged for RLUSD on Securitize’s platform, is worth $74 million, while only having 14 different holders. Shares in BUIDL and VBILL are represented by tokens that change hands at $1, but unlike most stablecoins, they offer investors a yield. Products issued through Securitize’s platform do not yet exist on XRP Ledger, but Tuesday’s announcement notes that “additional use cases and assets [are] planned,” while Securitize will “expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem” through its own moves. On Monday, Ripple unveiled an updated roadmap for XRPL, highlighting new compliance features like the ability for token issuers to “deep freeze” wallet addresses and a method for being able to “dry run” transactions. “Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. “Together, we’re delivering real-time settlement and programmable liquidity across a new class of compliant, on-chain investment products.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Snowflake-led coalition targets data fragmentation with vendor-neutral semantic standard

UPDATED 09:00 EDT / SEPTEMBER 23 2025 by Paul Gillin Snowflake Inc. and a group of partners today launched the Open Semantic Interchange initiative, an open-source effort to standardize how organizations define and share business semantics across data and analytics platforms. The initiative aims to create a vendor-neutral specification for business metrics, dimensions and metadata that can be used consistently across business intelligence tools, data catalogs and artificial intelligence applications. The 17 initial participants include Salesforce, BlackRock Inc. and dbt Labs Inc. Data semantics describe the meaning and context of data relative to business concepts, processes and rules. For example, consistent semantics ensure that different systems and teams interpret terms like “customer,” “revenue” and “operating margin” the same way. Many organizations manage business metrics across multiple BI and analytics systems, each with its own set of semantic definitions. That leads to duplication of effort and inconsistent definitions. The initiative is an effort to resolve those differences. “A strong request from customers has been to make semantic models interoperable,” said Josh Klahr, director of analytics product management at Snowflake. “They want to make it easy for a model in one place to show up in another location, avoid the risk of vendor lock-in and think about interoperability for the long term.” The effort will initially focus on analytics and BI use cases with an additional emphasis on enabling AI interfaces to work with consistent, verified data definitions. Work on the specification has just begun, with a working group defining the first version of a draft standard that’s likely to be published within the next few months, Klahr said. Numerous technology- and industry-specific semantic standards already exist, with several administered by the World Wide Web Consortium. The standard is expected to build on existing approaches where possible, using widely adopted formats such as YAML to define metrics, hierarchies and relationships. “YAML will likely end up being the definition language,” Klahr said. Snowflake said the initiative will probably be donated to either the Apache Software Foundation or the Linux Foundation. “It’s early to say which because we want the working group to agree on what the licensing model will be,” Klahr said, “but the plan is to be an open-source project.” The company expects the list of participating vendors to grow rapidly. “There’s lots of interest,” Klahr said. “This is something that makes sense to everybody.” Snowflake rival Databricks Inc. isn’t a founding member, but “I would love for additional partners like Databricks to be part of the effort as well,” he said.

Title: From Goldman To AI: How Rishi Bali Is Building Wall Street’s Transformation Layer With OPCO.AI

Full Content:
BySindhya Valloppillil, Contributor. Finance runs on spreadsheets. OPCO.AI thinks that’s a $1 trillion risk. Wall Street’s next alpha isn’t in trading — it’s in AI infrastructure. If and when the credit cycle tightens, the dominoes don’t ask permission: one missed covenant, one delayed NAV, one reconciliation error in an inbox. Private markets still run too much on PDFs and spreadsheets; in a storm, that’s a fault line.. One firm betting that alpha now depends as much on the pipes as on the trade is OPCO.AI—founded by Goldman veteran Rishi Bali. OPCO.AI describes itself as Wall Street’s transformation layer — a builder that fuses risk, operations, and technology into a single, AI-powered operating core. After three decades building the machinery of modern finance — from Goldman’s credit desks and derivatives prime brokerage to multi-strategy hedge funds and private platforms — Bali is betting the edge in the next era won’t come from squeezing another basis point out of trades, but from sealing the basis points that leak out of broken workflows. Private Equity & Private Credit. The buyout playbook thrived on cheap leverage. Then rates spiked to decade highs. Banks, constrained by post-GFC rules, stepped back from riskier lending, and private equity stepped in. Private credit — once niche — is now one of finance’s fastest-growing corners, fueled by deep insurance capital (think Apollo/Athene, KKR/Global Atlantic). But while capital has institutionalized, the operating infrastructure hasn’t. Covenants and borrowing bases live in PDFs. Amendments move through email. Risk engines are patchy; finance systems creak; investor reporting lags. In a benign cycle, those gaps stay hidden. Under stress, they become systemic weaknesses. Growth-stage VC and crossover funds increasingly resemble PE in their structures and scale — and they too face rising expectations from institutional LPs for faster reporting, stronger controls, and more resilient infrastructure. Industry outlooks peg private markets at roughly $13 trillion today on a path toward $20 trillion by 2030, and fundraising in private credit has concentrated among experienced managers in the higher-rate era — a winner-take-most dynamic that raises the bar for operating maturity. The more immediate risk is toxic operations, not toxic assets—covenant data trapped in PDFs can be more dangerous than any single borrower. The systemic-risk debate here is well covered elsewhere (see recent WSJ interviews with Jamie Dimon and Sixth Street’s Alan Waxman, and FT coverage on opacity/retail exposure); this piece focuses on the operating spine rather than relitigating that debate. Counterpoint (brief): Not all agree private credit is systemic. FT has argued that fund lockups, hard redemption caps, and diversified lender bases blunt contagion risk. The operating burden still rises either way — especially on covenant data, valuations, and investor transparency. Hedge Funds. The two-and-twenty model faces a new math. Performance pressure in front; legacy systems in back. Many funds still run on 20-year-old risk/accounting stacks. Shadow accounting doubles effort; no-shadow outsourcing introduces fresh fragility. As complexity rises — from structured credit to CLO warehousing — manual reconciliations become existential. Allocators and regulators want near real-time views. Markets deliver macro, tariff, and geopolitical shocks on their own schedule. The result: sophistication at the strategy layer riding on creaky pipes underneath. Meanwhile, industry AUM has pushed to record territory — north of ~$4.5 trillion (HFR) — intensifying the need for industrial-grade controls and reporting. Recent fundraising barometers are widely covered (Bloomberg on Jain Global’s $5.3B debut; Bloomberg on D.E. Shaw’s human-run fund), underscoring a winner-take-most dynamic and closer scrutiny on infrastructure. In tight-spread markets, operational accuracy matters as much as strategy—the speed of reconciliation and provable lineage can outweigh another trading signal. Family Offices. Founder liquidity created a wave of family offices — and a governance gap. Too many run on ad hoc spreadsheets, basic custodial statements, or the wrong jurisdictional setups. The tools exist (Addepar/Mirador), but tools without institutional discipline don’t create controls. Moving from concentrated founder wealth to institutional portfolios requires operating rigor — policies, risk frameworks, and consolidated reporting — or concentration and operational risks compound quietly. Estimates for the number of family offices range widely — from ~8,000 to well over 10,000 globally — underscoring both growth and opacity in this segment. The reputational risk isn’t performance; it’s process opacity—allocators notice sloppy dashboards and inconsistent closes. Banks. Even with regulators watching, legacy cores and offshored processes have left surveillance, compliance, and trade-monitoring underinvested. For investment banks and capital markets players alike, financial governance and infrastructure modernization have become survival issues. Fines, model risk, and AI governance expectations have made “now or never” modernization unavoidable. Customers expect near real-time; fintechs set the bar; cyber risk expands with every integration. The U.S. shift to T+1 settlement compressed operational timelines further. Recent actions illustrate the cost of lagging controls: in 2024, U.S. regulators levied roughly $250 million (OCC) and $98.2 million (Federal Reserve) in penalties tied to surveillance deficiencies at a large U.S. bank; the CFTC added $200 million (with up to $100 million credit for overlapping issues). The choice is stark: pay later in penalties and reputation, or invest now in resilient operating backbones. Being “regulated” isn’t the same as being resilient; in 2025, model/AI governance is the new capital ratio. Bali’s conviction is that AI isn’t a bolt-on tool; it’s a new operating paradigm. OPCO.AI positions itself as building an Operations Intelligence Layer — a governed data spine that fuses risk, operations, and technology with explainable automation, clear lineage, and human-in-the-loop AI copilots. His vantage point was earned in the trenches: Goldman Sachs Rates & Credit in the late 1990s, helping stand up the firm’s credit infrastructure as the asset class grew from a sidecar to a core engine; launching derivatives prime brokerage to support multi-asset hedge funds; then senior roles at D.B. Zwirn, UBS Dillon Read, Alphadyne, and Citigroup Tribeca Global Management. He also built a Made-in-USA technical apparel brand with institutional capital — a founder’s lesson in execution and design that now shows up in OPCO.AI’s doctrine: design is a control. OPCO.AI is a builders’ shop, not a slide factory. Senior operators collapse risk, ops, and tech into a single source of truth, run pre‑mortems to contain blast radius, and treat design as a control. The team executes fast, hands the capability back, and measures success in hard outcomes: fewer exceptions, faster closes, cleaner audits, and basis points saved. At Goldman, Bali watched credit evolve from an offshoot of rates into a full asset class — investment grade, high yield, CDO/CLO warehousing, credit reinsurance — and helped architect the operating controls those desks needed to scale. Extending prime brokerage beyond equities into credit, rates, and FX required entirely new models of risk and reconciliation. Today, as private markets take on the scale and scrutiny once reserved for public markets, the operating burden has multiplied. OPCO.AI is his vehicle for applying that experience at buy-side scale. Every engagement starts with a one‑line brief — the sharpest statement of pain (e.g., “Covenant monitoring is broken,” “Month‑end takes 15 days,” “We have three versions of P&L”). From that single sentence, the team expands it into a working system the client owns: documented workflows, reconciliations, controls, and governance. Within ~60 days, a live data model and automated reconciliations establish provable lineage and seal the first cracks; by ~120 days, 60–80% of repetitive workflows are automated, exceptions are routed and tracked, investor reporting accelerates, and risk and finance speak to a single source of truth. The Target Operating Model is then institutionalized: the Current State is benchmarked, the Ideal State is defined (provable lineage, automated recs, consistent reporting, embedded controls), and a Future State path is laid out (agentic workflows, real‑time risk) aligned to mandate and culture. OPCO.AI hands back the capability with clean documentation and durable design, and measures success in hard outcomes: fewer breaks, faster closes, cleaner audits, and basis points saved. Discovery maps a fund’s operating DNA — beyond “the close is slow” to the root causes: lineage gaps, control breaks, and seams between risk, ops, and tech. From that mandate, the team designs toward the Target Operating Model and executes on two tracks at once: tactical fixes (automate the highest‑pain reconciliations, stabilize data feeds, standardize investor reporting) and strategic rebuild (a governed data spine that unifies risk/finance/ops with near‑real‑time NAV/P&L and designed workflows). Embedded throughout is Risk Diagnostics across three dimensions — efficiency, operational robustness, and regulatory resilience — which prioritize what to fix first, how to contain exceptions, and how to evidence compliance. The outcome is a solutions layer the client owns: harmonized with legacy, auditable by design, and ready for AI agents. The outcome is a Solutions Layer the client owns: harmonized with legacy, auditable by design, and ready for AI agents. Most finance UX feels like 1995. OPCO.AI builds cockpit-grade interfaces (Python/React) where clarity is a control. On the AI side, MCP acts like a USB port for agents across fragmented systems, with lineage preserved. The next frontier: agentic AI with DLT-based proof-of-human/intent, so every action is authenticated, authorized, and auditable. Consultants. The Big Four (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) dominate operations and risk consulting. Their strengths are clear: global scale, regulatory expertise, and armies of specialists who can handle audits, model validation, and remediation at size. The trade‑offs are equally well known: long timelines, junior‑heavy staffing pyramids, and deliverables that skew toward diagnostics and governance artifacts over shipped systems. Large programs can drift into “transformation theater,” where steering committees multiply but on‑desk change lags. Conflicts (audit vs. advisory) and complex RACI structures can also slow decisions, which matters when firms need working controls in weeks, not quarters. Fund Administrators. SS&C, Citco, State Street, Northern Trust, Apex and others provide NAV calculation, investor services, and regulatory filings at industrial scale. Their advantages: deep control frameworks, established SLAs, and familiarity with the dominant accounting stacks (e.g., Geneva, VPM). Limitations arise when administrators are asked to redesign front‑to‑back workflows: customization is constrained, change management is ticket‑driven, and integration across risk/ops/finance can be slow. The mandate is to keep accurate books, not to re‑architect operating models. As more managers experiment with “no‑shadow” setups, the quality of reconciliations, exception handling, and data lineage becomes a central dependency — and a potential bottleneck. Technology Platforms. Arcesium, SEI Novus, Allvue, BlackRock Aladdin, iCapital, and Addepar each offer powerful tools, but generally in siloed domains. Arcesium, spun out of D.E. Shaw, provides portfolio accounting and reconciliation systems. SEI Novus emphasizes analytics and manager intelligence for allocators. Allvue delivers fund accounting and investor reporting software to private capital managers. BlackRock’s Aladdin is the dominant risk and portfolio management platform for asset owners, but was designed primarily with the perspective of institutions like pension funds, not buy-side funds. iCapital has built a strong platform for alternative investment access and distribution, while Addepar focuses on consolidated reporting for family offices and wealth managers. Each of these platforms has become essential in its niche, yet most were not built to integrate seamlessly across the full workflow of private credit, hedge funds, and multi-strategy platforms. Niche AI/Data Startups. Players like Canoe Intelligence, FundGuard, Hazeltree, or 73 Strings focus on automating narrow slices of fund operations. Canoe specializes in extracting and structuring data from fund documents, FundGuard applies cloud-native tech to accounting and NAV oversight, Hazeltree handles treasury and liquidity management, and 73 Strings provides valuation and portfolio monitoring.Each addresses real pain points, but they operate as point solutions. Their limitation is that they rarely integrate across the full operating stack, leaving firms with improved pockets of efficiency but without an overarching infrastructure layer. Boutique Consultancies. Smaller shops exist, but they lack global reach and the institutional lineage of larger players. Their impact is often limited by scale. So what? The market is crowded with capable specialists — consultants for governance, administrators for books, platforms for slices of the workflow, and AI point‑solutions for specific tasks — but few offerings bridge them into a unified, governed operating spine. Managers that can prove real‑time lineage, faster closes, exception containment, and audit‑ready automation are the ones winning allocator trust — and, increasingly, capital. What could go wrong? Operational rewiring rarely ships on Gantt charts. Integrations sprawl, legacy data fights back, and AI systems raise governance questions — explainability, audit trails, and model drift. There’s vendor‑dependency risk, too: moving reconciliations and covenant parsing into a single layer concentrates failure unless controls are designed for containment. The bet here is that disciplined design, human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, and provable lineage can shrink that blast radius. Over the last decade, capital migrated: private credit exploded, hedge funds scaled, family offices multiplied, and even banks offshored in search of efficiency. But the pipes never caught up. The operating burden now looks like a bank’s — without bank-grade controls. Data lineage can’t be proven. Valuation governance lacks audit trails. Investor reporting takes weeks, not hours. The next stress may not come from asset blowups alone — but from operational failures in reconciliation, surveillance, and governance that magnify them. OPCO.AI’s wager is clear: if Wall Street is going to withstand its next test, it won’t be thanks to another clever trade. It will be because the infrastructure held — transforming operations into alpha.

Title: Exclusive: Fast-growing crypto and stablecoin startup Zerohash raises $104 million

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. A recent flood of institutional demand for blockchain technology has helped to mint a new unicorn. Zerohash, a crypto and stablecoin infrastructure company headquartered in Chicago, announced Tuesday that it had raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation. Interactive Brokers, a publicly traded brokerage, led the round. In a crowded field of infrastructure companies, Zerohash has carved out a name for itself by helping financial institutions and fintechs build out their own products for stablecoins, crypto trading, and tokenization. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, and tokenization refers to putting financial assets into blockchain wrappers. Other participants in the startup’s fundraise included traditional finance giants like Morgan Stanley and Apollo Global Management. The publicly traded fintech SoFi and the crypto arm of the high-frequency trading firm Jump Trading also contributed, among others. The $1 billion valuation marks a significant jump from Zerohash’s last round in 2022, when it raised at a $340 million valuation, according to Pitchbook. The data aggregator’s estimate is “about accurate,” said Edward Woodford, founder and CEO of Zerohash, but he declined to specify his company’s valuation in its prior fundraise. The near tripling in Zerohash’s worth signals how crypto, which contracted from 2022 to 2024, is now riding another wave of hype. And the traditional finance institutions backing the startup are evidence of how Wall Street investors, not just a ragtag group of cypherpunk libertarians, are driving the market’s recent surge. “Crypto now is not a debated issue at this point at large institutional banks,” said Woodford. Although Woodford has been in crypto for almost a decade, he’s no cypherpunk. In 2015, he graduated from MIT with a master’s degree in finance and launched a swaps platform for emerging commodities, like industrial hemp. He sold the business in 2017 to the brokerage Tastytrade, and, that same year, Woodford went on to build a new company. That business has cycled through a variety of names and stylizations—Seed CX, Zero #, Zero Hash, and now Zerohash—but it’s always focused on building crypto infrastructure for financial institutions. Over eight years, Woodford has managed to ride multiple crypto booms and busts. “It’s not just that we’re a survivor,” he said. “We’ve actually thrived in that market, and actually now, I think we can accelerate that even further.” But it’s this cycle of crypto, where every Wall Street firm appears to be piling into digital assets amid pro–crypto regulation from President Donald Trump, that seems to be tailor-made for Zerohash. “It’s not that they weren’t doing any work on this stuff already,” Woodford, referring to financial institutions. “But they just weren’t able to move into the space, and now there’s a clear path for them to be able to do so.” While Woodford wouldn’t disclose his startup’s revenue or whether it was profitable, he did say Zerohash has increased its topline each year over the past three years, even during the Crypto Winter of 2022 through 2024. Zerohash, which has about 200 employees, has three business verticals. It develops a white-labeled crypto brokerage that companies like Interactive Brokers can spin up to more easily let their customers buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has APIs for tokenization, which has helped, for example, BlackRock tokenize money market funds. And it builds stablecoin networks to let customers, including Stripe, more easily send and receive the tokens. “Zerohash has been able to grow with headwinds,” said Woodford. “Imagine what it looks like with tailwinds.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
