US President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin a four-day tour of the Gulf region, with a focus on economic agreements rather than regional security crises, including the war in Gaza and the growing tension over Iran’s nuclear program.Accompanied by prominent American business leaders – including Tesla CEO and Trump adviser Elon Musk – Trump will visit Riyadh first, the site of the Saudi-US Investment Forum. He is scheduled to travel to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.“While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over,” Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih said as he opened the forum. “As a result... when Saudis and Americans join forces, very good things happen – more often than not, great things happen when those joint ventures happen,” he added, speaking ahead of Trump’s arrival.The forum began with a video montage featuring soaring eagles and falcons, celebrating the longstanding relationship between the United States and the kingdom.Seated at the front of a palatial hall were BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Blackstone CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, and al-Falih.Saudi Arabia and the United States have enjoyed decades of strong ties, anchored by a longstanding agreement in which the kingdom supplies oil and the superpower provides security. Trump may also travel to Turkey on Thursday for potential face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.This marks Trump’s second foreign trip since taking office again – his first was to Rome for Pope Francis’s funeral – and it comes amid escalating geopolitical tensions.In addition to pursuing a resolution to the war in Ukraine, his administration is advocating a new aid mechanism for Gaza and urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire.Over the weekend, US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman to discuss a potential deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump has warned that military action remains on the table if diplomacy fails.

In January, Saudi Arabia pledged $600 billion in investments in the US over the next four years, but Trump has stated he will request a full trillion. Alongside Musk, business figures such as Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser and BlackRock’s Fink are expected to join the trip.Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are also traveling with the president.During the Riyadh leg of the tour, Trump is expected to offer Saudi Arabia an arms deal worth well over $100 billion, sources told Reuters. The package could include advanced weaponry, such as C-130 transport aircraft.Israel-Saudi normalization topic to be avoided during Trump's visitThe topic of normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel is expected to be avoided during this visit, sources said, despite Trump viewing such an agreement as a key regional objective.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected imminent progress on expanding the Abraham Accords – a series of agreements brokered during Trump’s first term, under which countries such as the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco recognized Israel.However, Netanyahu’s opposition to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza or the creation of a Palestinian state makes further normalization talks with Riyadh unlikely, according to sources.Trump’s visits to Qatar and the UAE are also expected to emphasize economic cooperation.In Qatar, the royal family is reportedly planning to gift Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 aircraft, intended for eventual use as Air Force One. The arrangement has drawn scrutiny from ethics experts.Trump is expected to donate the plane to his presidential library after completing his term.

SCB WEALTH, a key business unit of SCB, is dedicated to enhancing the wealth of Thai investors and expanding opportunities for global investments. SCB launched partnership with BlackRock who is the world’s largest asset management company. By partnering with BlackRock, a company that shares the same business philosophy, both organizations emphasize the customer-centric approach, focusing on developing investment products that truly meet clients’ needs. SCB WEALTH views wealth management as a long-term investment, ensuring a strong financial future under the concept of “Your Success. Our Success.” Under this collaboration, the bank’s wealth clients will gain privilege access to exclusive world-class investment products, in-depth research, and strategic market insights through BlackRock’s extensive global network, said Mr. Kris Chantanotoke, Chief Executive Officer of SCB. He said the bank spent about a year finalizing the collaboration to ensure the partnership genuinely enhances the wealth of Thais. As a result, the bank is deeply focusing on three core areas of development under this collaboration: investment products, research and risk management, and human capabilities “SCB has set an ambitious goal to become No.1 wealth management institution in Thailand by 2026. To achieve this, partnering with a global leader like BlackRock is essential, as it aligns with our strategic objectives in every aspect”, said Mr Kris. Through this strategic partnership, SCB WEALTH combines its deep understanding of Thai investors' needs with BlackRock’s global investment expertise. This synergy enables the creation of tailored investment strategies and solutions that align with clients’ financial goals and risk profiles. As part of the partnership, SCB Wealth and BlackRock have established working team to evaluate and curate exclusive investment products for the bank’s wealth clients, reinforcing the unique value of this collaboration. Additionally, SCB WEALTH prioritizes the development of its Relationship Managers (RMs) through a specialized training program designed by SCB WEALTH Academy in collaboration with BlackRock.

Title: Trump is headed to Saudi Arabia — and a 'who's who' of US CEOs are right behind him

As President Donald Trump embarks on the first international trip of his second term, a crowd of Wall Street and Silicon Valley executives are also jetting off to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, executives from companies like Google, Nvidia, and BlackRock are scheduled to speak at the Saudi-US Investment Forum, according to the event's website. The forum will cover a range of topics — AI, energy, defense, and manufacturing, to name a few — and host some of the kingdom's power brokers. Investment is top of mind beyond Tuesday's conference: Trump has said he wants to secure $1 trillion worth of deals during his trip to the gulf, multiple outlets reported. A guest list for a lunch on Tuesday included some of the event's most prominent speakers, like Elon Musk and Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, as well as other private sector bigwigs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi were among the diners who aren't slated to speak. The invite list provided by the White House Included Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn cofounder and noted Democrat, but his office later denied he was there, and his chief of staff posted a photo of them two together. A long list of Saudi business leaders were also invited, according to the guest list. Here are some of the biggest names scheduled to take the stage at Tuesday's forum. Representatives for the Saudi-US Investment Forum did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is listed as a featured speaker as Saudi Arabia is working to establish itself as a global AI leader. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, has committed to investing more than $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia in the coming years to build data centers for the computing power needed to run AI models. The Palantir CEO is scheduled to speak at the conference, and has recently credited a pro-defense tech wave for solid first quarter performance. Alex Karp said on a recent earnings call that part of Palantir's success had to do with "an unvarnished cacophony of the combination of 20 years of investment and a massive cultural shift in the US." Elon Musk is listed as a speaker, just a few months after Tesla announced it will be entering the Saudi market. The world's richest man has previously had a somewhat rocky relationship with Saudi Arabia over unsuccessful business deals. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, launched an investment firm in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, last year, and CEO Larry Fink stressed the firm's global reach on a recent earnings call. He was once a leading voice on issues like ESG and DEI, but the firm's recent annual letter didn't mention either issue. Instead, Fink wrote in it that BlackRock is now betting big on the private market. Trump's AI and crypto czar is among the White House officials scheduled to speak. On Sunday evening, David Sacks posted about arriving in the Middle East on X, saying that America needs to be the "partner-of-choice" when it comes to AI, and that "effective AI diplomacy is vital now more than ever." Representatives from Nvidia spoke at this year's Global AI Summit, hosted in Saudi Arabia, and now CEO Jensen Huang is set to represent the chips giant at Tuesday's conference. A top Saudi AI official told CNBC in September that the country hoped to get access to Nvidia's high-performance chips within the year. Groq, a semiconductor startup and potential competitor to Nvidia, announced that it has gotten a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to expand the delivery of its AI chips. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser is among the Wall Street leaders slated to speak. She also spoke at Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative in October. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone, also spoke at Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative ahead of the presidential election and said he thought that Trump would be a better president the second time around. Last year, the billionaire said he wants Blackstone to become the "largest financial investor" in global AI infrastructure. Boeing has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia since the 1940s, according to its website. Though CEO Kelly Ortberg is scheduled to speak in Saudi Arabia, Boeing has made headlines related to a different country in the Middle East, after multiple outlets reported that the Qatari royal family plans to give the Trump administration a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet to be used as Air Force One. The plane is worth a staggering $400 million and has been criticized by figures on both political parties for potential conflicts of interest. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet, is scheduled to speak, and Google has made recent investments in Saudi Arabia. In 2024, the company announced that it was opening an AI hub in Saudi Arabia, and a 2025 partnership between Accenture and Google Cloud seeks to further generative AI capacities in the country. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently announced a new slate of AI products from IBM as the company seeks to grow its generative AI business. In February, IBM announced it was expanding its AI efforts in Saudi Arabia and the company opened regional headquarters in the country last year. Omeed Malik founder and president of 1789 Capital, a VC firm that counts Donald Trump Jr. among its partners. He recently started a private club in Washington, DC, that caters to the MAGA social scene once co-hosted a Trump fundraiser that raised upwards of $10 million. 1789 Capital invests in energy and software, among other industries, and it bills itself as anti-ESG. Instead, it focuses on "EIG" — entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth. Jump to

During the regulator’s fourth crypto-focused roundtable since March, which today focused on moving traditional Wall Street securities onto blockchain networks, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw interrogated whether the premise of hosting traditional finance firms at the agency’s headquarters, to discuss how they should adopt blockchain technology, may constitute overstepping. In recent months, former Democratic SEC appointees have begun openly questioning the motives behind the Republican Party’s recent embrace of crypto, with some arguing that exempting the novel sector from securities regulations could in turn weaken consumer protections in traditional financial markets. “No one seems to disagree that the SEC should remain a tech-neutral regulator,” Crenshaw said Monday. “So why is it our place to assess particular forms of blockchains as candidates for industry adoption? Why would we focus on blockchain in particular over other types of distributed ledger technologies?” “Regulatory efforts to facilitate adoption of blockchain, let alone specific forms of it, seems a bit like the government picking winners and losers,” she continued. Chairman Paul Atkins' remarks at the Crypto Task Force roundtable on tokenization: The topic of this afternoon’s discussion is timely as securities are increasingly migrating from traditional (or “off-chain”) databases to blockchain-based (or “on-chain”) ledger systems. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 12, 2025 The event was attended by representatives from Wall Street titans including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, all of which have expressed interest in offering securities via blockchain networks. It kicked off with remarks from SEC chair Paul Atkins, who praised crypto’s potential to revolutionize traditional financial markets. “Blockchain technology holds the promise to allow for a broad swath of novel use cases for securities, fostering new kinds of market activities that many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations don’t even contemplate today,” he said. The two principal selling points of tokenizing traditional securities markets have long been making such markets more efficient, and more accessible. Blockchain technology could, in theory, allow for the instantaneous, on-chain settlement of transactions like stock trades, which typically take a day to settle. Such speed could in turn allow for more accessible markets. But Crenshaw pushed back on such assumptions Monday, arguing that current delays in settlement on Wall Street allow for key benefits. Those include granting flexibility to pause transactions in cases of fraud or national security risk, and drastically reducing the number of transactions requiring final settlement, by about 98%. “This allows the current system to handle tremendous volume,” she said. “It’s a key reason why our markets withstood sustained, record breaking trading volume in recent weeks without major failures.” Crenshaw questioned, further, whether blockchain networks would be capable of settling every stock trade live in real-time, without causing those networks to crash. In her own remarks Monday, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, chief of the agency’s crypto task force, hailed blockchain technology as a tool with the potential to revolutionize securities markets just as the internet did. But she also acknowledged, deviating from prepared remarks, that her Democratic colleague may have a point about holding back from integrating instantaneous crypto transactions with Wall Street. “As Commissioner Crenshaw discussed, there are reasons why that might not always be something we want,” Peirce said. “But I think it’s a potential we should be thinking about.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Trump En Route To Middle East: Here’s What To Know

BySara Dorn andSiladitya Ray BySara Dorn, Forbes Staff andSiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump signed a $600 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that includes a major defense contract and substantial investments in artificial intelligence—as U.S. business executives made their own set of deals in the backdrop of Trump’s visit to Riyadh, the first stop on his four-day tour of the Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an official ... More state arrival ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi company DataVolt will invest $20 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the U.S. and the Saudis will purchase $142 billion in military equipment and services from the U.S. as part of the agreement, according to a White House press release. Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would aim to increase its total investment to $1 trillion—a figure Trump has repeatedly urged Riyadh to agree to. Coinciding with Trump’s visit, U.S. billionaires, including Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Palantir’s Alex Karp and BlackRock’s Larry Fink attended the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where organizers said 145 deals worth more than $300 billion have been signed, including a deal for Nvidia to sell 18,000 AI chips to the new Saudi-backed company Humain, and Saudi approval of Musk’s Starlink. Trump also announced the U.S. would ease sanctions against Syria, and a White House official said he agreed to “say hello” on Wednesday to Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Al Qaeda member who has since severed ties with the terrorist organization and took over after Bashar al-Assad regime was overthrown in December. Trump, who raised the possibility he could ease the sanctions on Monday, said he made the decision at Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s urging, though the timing of the announcement will most certainly raise eyebrows after al-Sharaa on Monday proposed a Trump Tower Damascus, Reuters reported, citing multiple sources. Conflict-of-interest concerns swirled ahead of Trump’s visit, particularly surrounding Trump’s family business ventures in the region and, more recently, the expected announcement that Qatar will gift the Trump administration a new 747 mega-jet.

Saudi Arabia debuted the company Monday. It’s chaired by bin Salman and backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and Public Investment Fund. Former Aramco Digital executive Tareq Amin will lead the company, which will “pave the way for a groundbreaking national AI strategy in Saudi Arabia,” Amin said in a December LinkedIn post. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was also in Saudi Arabia to announce the deal alongside Amin. The defense contract includes sales across five categories: air force and space, air and missile defense, maritime security, border security and information technology and communications systems, the White House said. In addition to the defense agreement, it also includes a deal for Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD and Uber to invest more than $80 billion in both countries. The Saudis welcomed Trump with great fanfare. Saudi fighter jets escorted Air Force One upon its landing in Riyadh, where bin Salman greeted Trump on the tarmac, and a convoy of Arabian horses then surrounded Trump’s motorcade en route to the Saudi royal court. The Saudi crown prince’s decision to personally greet Trump at the tarmac of Riyadh’s airport stood in stark contrast to the cold reception former President Joe Biden received in 2022. The former president had criticized bin Salman over the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi during his presidential campaign and vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into a “pariah” state. In 2021, the Biden administration also halted the delivery of offensive weapons to the Saudi government, citing concerns about its handling of the conflict in Yemen. But when faced with high oil prices in 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden flew to the Middle Eastern kingdom to persuade it to ramp up oil production. He was greeted by a provincial governor at the airport and later met bin Salman in Jeddah, where the two shared an awkward fist bump. On Wednesday, Trump will travel to Qatar, where he’ll meet with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. He will conclude the trip Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, where he will meet with President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan before returning to the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, among others. Multiple Trump-branded properties and crypto deals are among those in the Trump family’s Middle East business portfolio. Among the real estate ventures in the works are a Trump golf resort in Qatar and Trump residential towers in Dubai and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. An investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates, MGX, also used $2 billion in stablecoin issued by the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial to invest in Binance earlier this year. The deal contributed to the failure last week of a crypto industry-friendly bill that would have regulated stablecoins, as senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about Trump's links to the MGX-Binance deal and his personal stake in the stablecoin legislation. The White House has dismissed concerns about any potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s official government duties and his personal business in the Middle East. “I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday. Trump is seeking a $1 trillion investment in the U.S. from Saudi Arabia. He told reporters in March he agreed to the trip because Saudi Arabia agreed to the investment, though Riyadh has yet to confirm the figure, and experts told The New York Times the amount is unrealistic given the size of Saudi Arabia’s economy. Qatar is expected to gift the Trump administration a $400 million 747-8 jumbo jet to use in place of Air Force One—what could be the largest foreign gift to the federal government in history, raising concerns it could set the stage for a quid pro quo situation. The White House has vehemently rejected any pay-for-play suggestions. Trump said Monday the plane would be gifted to the Defense Department, not him personally. He also said he wouldn’t use the plane after leaving office even though it would be donated to his presidential library after its tenure as Air Force One. Saudi Arabia proposed in January an additional $600 billion investment in the U.S. over the next four years, with the potential to increase the amount, though it’s unclear exactly where the money would go. The United Arab Emirates announced in March a new $1.4 trillion investment over the next decade in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, manufacturing and energy. The U.S. and Qatar last year reached an agreement to extend U.S. military presence at the Al Udeid Air Base for another 10 years. No, and it’s been noted by experts that it could be viewed as a sign of tensions between Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “There’s nothing that Netanyahu has that Trump wants, needs or can give him, as opposed to, say, the Saudis, the Qataris, the Emiratis,” former Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told CNN. Trump has made several moves recently that have reportedly surprised Israel, including renewed nuclear deal negotiations with Iran and his agreement for a ceasefire between the U.S. and the Houthis, but not Israel. The U.S. also negotiated the release of the last American Hamas hostage, Edan Alexander, released Monday, without Israel.

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/12/2025 9:48:18 AM PDT by MtnClimber The banking industry is attempting to take programs from Indiana’s state treasurer because he works to protect Christians and conservatives. ndiana lawmakers amended a proposal that had attempted to give some of state Treasurer Daniel Elliott’s powers to big banks angered by his strong defense of taxpayers, Christians, and conservatives. Yet the program is still at risk of being turned over to the state’s powerful banking lobby, which has donated to all the politicians who control the $3 billion local investment pool targeted by the changes. The provision inserted by Republican Sen. Travis Holdman, a former bank CEO, initially attempted to demote Elliott from sole manager of TrustIndiana to one member of a banker-controlled five-member board managing that pool. Holdman was formerly on the board of a bankers’ organization that merged into the outfit that lobbied for these changes, the Indiana Banker’s Association. The IBA “has been opposed to some of my policies right from the beginning,” Elliott said in a phone interview. “They were opposed to me pushing back on ESG [leftist social justice investment metrics]. They were opposed to me fighting against BlackRock … That’s fine, they can have their opinions. What bothered me was that this was a backroom deal done in the middle of the night.” Banking Regulations Hurt TaxpayersElliott told The Federalist bankers on the board would present a conflict of interest, as banks can financially benefit from the pool investments. Local officials are beneficiaries of the program, and thus naturally want TrustIndiana to perform optimally while lacking ethical conflicts over where the money is invested, Elliott noted. This is why the Association of Indiana Counties opposed the attempted changes. So did Hoosier conservative activists, who rallied at the governor’s mansion in late April to push for property tax cuts and protect TrustIndiana. “This is crony capitalism at its worst,” “said Coalition of Central Indiana Tea Parties Chairman Adam Harvey in a press release. “They want to put a board of bankers over the elected State Treasurer, directing investments that benefit their shareholders instead of Hoosier taxpayers and local governments.” The banking lobby already has reduced TrustIndiana’s returns by requiring 50 percent of the pool to go into bank deposits, which return a lower interest rate, Elliott said. The S&P will not rate TrustIndiana, he said, “because it has too much of its assets in bank deposits.” That’s just one of several examples of how Indiana’s banking lobby has reduced TrustIndiana returns for local officials and taxpayers via regulations, Elliott said. To get some of those removed, he agreed to the legislature creating a board to oversee the program.

The S&P will not rate TrustIndiana, he said, “because it has too much of its assets in bank deposits.” That’s just one of several examples of how Indiana’s banking lobby has reduced TrustIndiana returns for local officials and taxpayers via regulations, Elliott said.

Title: ‘Putting everyone’s health record on their phone would save the HSE billions’

Vision outlined at Digital Health Summer School in Maynooth Maynooth University Professor Martin Curley Giving everyone in Ireland a health record on their phone that also offers preventative healthcare assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) could save the HSE billions and help to dramatically cut patient waiting lists and numbers in A&E. That’s according to a vision to become a leading digital health nation set out by the health service’s former digital transformation director and current Maynooth University Professor Martin Curley as he launched an initiative called Mission 10X at its Digital Health Summer School. “This is a moonshot empowering every Irish citizen to manage and improve their health. We want your health to revolve around you and not around hospitals,” he said. The school’s launch saw demonstrations of a number of technologies, including AI-assisted smartwatches to monitor patients who are at risk and AI-assisted screening technology deployable in homes, pharmacies, primary care centres and GP practices.. “These innovations are low-risk, low-cost proven technologies that help detect disease early. It’s a preventative approach, in contrast to the current one, where we spend the majority of the budget on treating sick patients in hospitals. “The best way to predict the future is to innovate it. We have all the knowledge and technology to build and scale a world-class health and wellness system – one powered by open, intelligent technology and centred on patients, not paperwork. “Deploying these nationwide could ultimately enable us to offer a full annual medical screening for about €100 per person. Early detection is better for the service, for patients and for health budgets. “Mission 10X is fully aligned with Sláintecare, would cost €100m and is achievable in about five years, enabling the nation to ‘leapfrog’ current systemic and infrastructural obstacles,” he said. Prof Curley’s vision is in contrast to the HSE’s current digital health approach centred on hospitals and regions. Last year, its Digital Health Strategic Implementation Roadmap sought an increase in the HSE’s annual IT budget to between €1bn and €1.4bn a year over seven years. Health sources say that hospital-based digital health records would cost between €2bn and €5bn to roll out nationwide. “That would only see us largely get to where some other countries’ health services were 20 years ago. But Mission 10X could also complement that plan,” Prof Curley said. Ireland ranks last in European digital health rankings, but could become a global leader alongside countries such as Estonia, which has already adopted this approach, if our health service adopted 10 recommendations his vision is based on, Prof Curley said. “We’ve had an increase to date of about 3.5pc in health productivity as the result of 50,000 more health workers and spending €8bn. This preventative approach would save anywhere between 10 and 100 times its comparatively low cost,” he added. The first step towards this goal is a phased investment in a secure patient information network, or SPINE, at an initial cost of €10 million to study its feasibility, ahead of scaling to a €100 million nationwide deployment, he said. Prof Curley, a former senior Intel executive who is now Director of Digital Health at the University’s Innovation Value Institute, has already trialled the initiative with two senior HSE managers and 15,000 patients in Leinster, some of whom have complex health needs. The trial also involved 1,000 patient queries that would otherwise have seen all of them visit their GP or local A&E. Out of those, our approach helped triage and guide people to establish that 30 actually needed to visit their GP, and six needed to go to A&E. “If you multiply that small example on a nationwide scale, it could be transformational for health productivity, and in terms of the time and cost savings to both patients and health workers. It benefits everyone,” Prof Curley said. His vision is supported by a range of clinicians and others concerned with and within the health system. Dr John Sheehan, Clinical Director of Radiology at Blackrock Health, said: “With a modest initial investment of €10m, Ireland can create a scalable digital health system, mirroring Estonia’s successful model. This is a historical opportunity we cannot afford to miss.” Stephen McMahon, head of the Irish Patients Association added: “This is a revolutionary beacon of hope and healing for patients today and future generations. Mission 10X shows that together, we truly can transform healthcare.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: WoW's Leeroy Jenkins, one of the internet's oldest memes, turns 20 years old—and after looking back on what we wrote in 2005, I feel like we've failed Leeroys everywhere

I'm comin' up with 32.33 (repeating of course) percentage of feeling your age. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I don't like to make our readers feel the weight of the passing years—but I'm afraid I have to inform you that Leeroy Jenkins, one of the internet's oldest memes, turned 20 years old yesterday. I know, I know. I'm not sure how to feel about it either. The meme (which is one year away from being able to drink in the US, and has already been slamming pints for two years in the UK) was released on May 11, 2005 to Warcraftmovies—you know, back when you could still have websites dedicated to the machinima of a single game. Also, back when 'Machinima' was still a word people used. The video, recorded by the charmingly-named guild Pals for Life, features the titular Leeroy Jenkins just absolutely screwing up an entire raid pull in the Rookery of Blackrock Spire. It's a perfect comedy routine: A set of exasperated, tired gamers talking about their chances of successfully pulling off a good fight. One player saying, with full knowledge that the number's a complete asspull, how the group has a "32.33 (repeating of course) percentage" of victory. Then Leeroy, belting his own name like a battlecry to the gods, springs out of his AFK state, fuelled by some animating spirit of the skalds of legend, and barrels inside, quickly killing everybody in a swarm of dial-up internet lag and bad decisions. As the dust settles, he's called "stupid as hell", to which he replies "at least I have chicken". Two decades later, we're still making Leeroy jokes. In 2023, US House representative Jared Huffmann belted his name with the same intonation after three days of arduous voting. Sweep back through the past, and you'll be pelted with Leeroy Jenkins. How I Met Your Mother even referenced it, doubtless leaving plenty of sitcom watchers confused. Turns out, we even wrote about it back then—and with a little bit of hunting in our archives by our own Dave Jones, we were able to dredge up some excerpts from "The Ballad of Leeroy Jenkins" by former PCG writer Craig Pearson. It gives a nice window into the 2005-era internet. An era I fear we've now well and truly lost. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. "A legend has been born," Pearson wrote. "Leeroy's guild forum is littered with fans clamouring to bask in the man's presence." He goes on to cite a post from the Pals for Life site, which stated: "All day today my local radio station was pranking people with the Leeroy Jenkins yell, and my local tobacco and liquor shop was giving away free drinks and radio station T-shirts to people who came in and yelled 'Hell yea it's Friday, LEEROY JENKINS!!!!'. All damn day they were doing this." According to that article, Leeroy's player endured no small amount of internet stardom, for good or for ill, with routine messages and "increased attention from enemy players, horde gangs queuing up to snuff him out the minute he shows up in enemy territory." Rewatching the video itself, I can't help but feel nostalgic. Even if Kotaku would later break my heart and reveal it was staged—although re-reading Pearson's article from 2005, it turns out most people knew all along: "Of course, it's a setup. Made to parody nerdy guilds," he wrote, before also adding that Pals for Life themselves told PCG directly that: "With MMOs, a lot of people treat the game as a job, and with our guild that is exactly what we're trying to avoid". Pearson also elaborates that "Stunts like naked raids on enemy settlements are an integral part of their manifesto". Hardly the type to have a mathemagician spin percentiles out of thin air. It's a symbol of a simpler time, where videogame memes could crop up pure, unfiltered, and spread because they were gut-bustingly funny. It also reflects a goofier era in MMOs in general—perhaps I was simply too much of a greenhorn noob in my youth, but in the modern era of instantly-solved raid mechanics and mandatory UI mods, I'm not sure something like Leeroy Jenkins could exist. Honestly, looking at Pearson's conclusion to the phenomenon nowadays gives me a sense dramatic irony: "For too long we've suffered under the folk who take games too seriously, who call us 'noobs' for dying, or killing them when they weren't expecting it, or not following their perfectly laid plans. "Leeroy shows us the way. A simple act of (staged) idiocy has freed us all and reminded us what gaming's about: Fun." Anyone who's done Mythic+ dungeon runs in WoW can tell you this liberation did not last. I'm sorry, Leeroy. We've lost our way. We no longer know how to cry "times up, let's do this!". We may not even have chicken. Sweaty, high-DPS min-maxers are now the expected norm, rather than the butt of a joke. Leeroy's brand of hooliganry now has to manifest in terms of service-violating nonsense—and while I'll still have a good-old chuckle, it's all far less wholesome. They just don't make memes like they used to, and none of us can just run in without fearing the wrath of strangers. The folks who take games too seriously won.

Additionally, Lunate will join the initiative, bringing expertise in global, multi-asset investment to the platform.

Operating from the ADGM, it will also cater to international markets, with a particular emphasis on the Middle East and Asia. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The platform’s operations will be built around an AI-native framework, aiming to improve data analytics and pricing, and expected to enhance risk assessment processes and capital efficiency. A buy-and-build strategy is central to the platform’s growth plans, targeting initial liabilities of more than $10bn (Dh36.73bn). The initial equity commitments are projected to be more than $1bn, supplemented by additional financing. BlackRock will make a minority investment in the venture upon completion of the definitive documentation. The leadership of the new company will be under the chairmanship of United Arab Emirates Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, with former Aviva CEO Mark Wilson at the helm. Al Jaber said: “Supported by exceptional global partners in IHC, BlackRock and Lunate, the new company will bring deep expertise, a strong capital base, and AI-driven underwriting to enhance efficiency and precision. Furthermore, establishing the company in ADGM gives us access to a robust regulatory framework, a rapidly growing insurance market and dynamic financial hub.” IHC CEO Syed Basar Shueb stated: “This venture embodies IHC’s commitment to innovation and strategic growth.

Title: Ethereum explodes 42% in one week, outperforming Bitcoin as 60% of holders move into profit

Ethereum's rally hints at a bullish phase as technical upgrades and easing tensions take hold. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum is back in the spotlight after jumping 42% over the past week to trade above $2,500, a level it hasn’t touched since March. This marks one of its most notable breakouts in over a year, signaling renewed investor confidence. On-chain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that this rally has pushed more than 60% of Ethereum addresses into profit. That’s nearly double the 32% recorded just a month earlier, highlighting the strength of the market’s turnaround. Moreover, the rally puts ETH ahead of Bitcoin in terms of recent performance. While Bitcoin climbed just 10% in the same period to surpass $105,000, Ethereum’s sharper rise has surprised many in the market. The rally has triggered speculation that Ethereum could be entering a new bullish phase after months of sluggish performance. Sean Dawson, head of research at Dervive.xyz, told CryptoSlate: “ETH has a 20% chance of exceeding $4,000 by Christmas (up from 9% last week) and a 12% chance of hitting $5,000. The chance of ETH falling below $1,500 by Christmas has dropped to 15% (down from 40%).” Market analysts have pointed out that several key factors, including recent technical improvements, rising institutional backing, and easing global tensions, appear to be fueling Ethereum’s recent surge. Last week, Ethereum completed its highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which unlocked a new set of features for the blockchain network. The update introduced improvements across the network’s wallet functionality, streamlined validator performance, and expanded Layer 2 support. These upgrades are expected to make Ethereum more efficient and easier to use across decentralized finance applications. Another factor driving ETH’s rally is the fact that several traditional financial institutions, including BlackRock, are deepening their use of Ethereum’s infrastructure through real-world asset tokenization. According to data from RWA.xyz, this sector has grown over 10% in the past 30 days, reaching a combined value of $22.1 billion. Ethereum leads the market with $6.9 billion locked in tokenized assets and controls 58% of the market share. Meanwhile, macroeconomic developments are also lifting sentiment in the broader market. A new trade agreement between the US and UK, alongside a temporary pause in US-China tariff escalations, has helped ease investor fears. These geopolitical developments support a broader risk-on mood in global markets, giving Ethereum further room to rise. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: SEC crypto task force to meet, with a spotlight on tokenization – Details

From the next steps for crypto to new blockchain shifts, here’s what we know. As the SEC’s Crypto Task Force prepares for its round table discussion, the backdrop is anything but quiet. The Roundtable on “Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain” kicks off tomorrow, and the sector braces for what’s dubbed a “spring sprint toward crypto clarity.” From BlackRock’s talks with regulators to the unexpected failure of the GENIUS Act in the Senate, the signals are clear – debates over the regulatory future of digital assets are heating up. Adding another dimension, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has outlined a bold new chapter for the blockchain platform; a shift toward faster development and more inclusive innovation in 2025. The U.S. SEC’s Digital Assets Task Force will hold its fourth Digital Asset Roundtable on the 12th of May, further reinforcing the growing intersection between TradFi and DeFi. Key SEC figures, including Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, will deliver opening remarks, with Peirce highlighting tokenization’s transformative potential. The agenda includes speakers from major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity, indicating increasing institutional engagement. Just days before the roundtable, stablecoin regulation hit a snag. On the 8th of May, the GENIUS Act – a long-anticipated stablecoin regulation bill – surprisingly failed to advance after a narrow 49-48 vote. The setback was driven by a notable shift among several Democrats who had earlier backed the legislation. Source: mailchi.mp Lawmakers, including Ruben Gallego and Lisa Blunt Rochester, cited national security risks, insufficient consumer protections, and gaps in anti-money laundering provisions as reasons for their reversal. Their joint statement called for tighter oversight, putting regulatory clarity on pause yet again. As institutional players deepen their engagement, BlackRock met with the SEC Crypto Task Force on the 9th of May to discuss a detailed agenda spanning staking, tokenization, and crypto ETP approval standards. Of course, BlackRock’s presence signaled more than curiosity—it was a deliberate push to define compliance in crypto investing. Source: X In parallel, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, announced a strategic shift in philosophy, departing from its traditionally slow, academically rigorous development model. In a candid update, he emphasized the urgency of delivering “Leios by 2026, not 2028,” justifying recent team contract terminations to prioritize speed and innovation. Hoskinson spotlighted Aiken and Midgard—new teams focused on modularity and speed, marking a break from Cardano’s early academic model. It is becoming increasingly evident that the sector is recalibrating toward faster execution and greater regulatory clarity.

Geopolitical Battleground: The Panama Canal is a critical trade and military chokepoint where U.S.-China tensions escalate, with Panama divided over American retreat and Chinese infrastructure expansion. Chinese Influence Grows: China is gaining control through ports, migration, and economic projects, filling the vacuum left by the U.S. after its 1999 handover of canal operations. Military & Economic Risks: The canal enables U.S. naval mobility; Chinese dominance could disrupt supply chains or sabotage the waterway by targeting key infrastructure like the Gatun Dam. Global Trade at Stake: Similar struggles exist in the Suez, Hormuz, and Malacca straits, where China exploits U.S. disengagement to reshape global trade routes in its favor. Urgent U.S. Action Needed: Without a stronger U.S. response, China may seize control, threatening Americaâs economic and military dominanceâexperts warn Washington must act before itâs too late.

Urgent U.S. Action Needed: Without a stronger U.S. response, China may seize control, threatening Americaâs economic and military dominanceâexperts warn Washington must act before itâs too late. The Panama Canal, a linchpin of global trade, has become the latest battleground in the escalating geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China. As tensions rise, Panamanians are dividedâsome urging Washington to reassert influence, while others fear Chinese colonization through infrastructure investments. Experts warn that losing control of this critical waterway could cripple U.S. economic and military logistics, leaving China poised to exploit the vacuum left by American retreat. A Strategic Waterway Under Threat The Panama Canal, which handles 70% of U.S. trade for both coasts, remains one of the most vital maritime chokepoints in the world. Yet, since the U.S. handed over control to Panama in 1999 under President Carter (finalized by Clinton), American influence has wanedâwhile China has steadily expanded its footprint. Michael Yon, a geopolitical analyst who recently returned from Panama, warns that China is "colonizing" the country through infrastructure projects, commercial ports, and migration. "The Chinese are taking over positions of power, mostly behind the scenes," Yon explained in an interview with Mike Adams on Brighton.com. "Theyâre building bridges, controlling ports, and subtly shifting demographicsâjust like they did in Hong Kong." U.S. Retreat, Chinese Expansion The Biden administration has continued the Obama-era policy of disengagement, while Chinaâs state-linked firms like Hutchison Ports now operate key terminals on both sides of the canal. BlackRock, a major U.S. asset manager with deep ties to China, has also sought to acquire these portsâraising concerns about de facto Chinese control over critical trade routes. Yon notes that Panamanian ship pilots guide every vesselâincluding U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriersâthrough the canal, a stark contrast to the past when American operators dominated. "The Panamanians ask, Where are the Americans? We left a vacuum, and China filled it," he said. Military and Economic Stakes The canal is not just an economic artery but a military lifeline for the U.S. Navy, allowing rapid deployment between the Atlantic and Pacific. If China gains dominance, it could strangle U.S. supply chains in a conflictâor even sabotage the canal by targeting the Gatun Dam, which, if destroyed, would drain the canalâs freshwater supply and shut it down for years. Trumpâs aggressive stanceâincluding threats to seize control of the canalâhas drawn mixed reactions. Some Panamanians welcome U.S. protection, while nationalists resist foreign intervention. "Panama is a juicy lamb surrounded by predators," Yon warned. "If the U.S. doesnât act, China or others will take it." Broader Geopolitical Chessboard The canal crisis mirrors struggles elsewhere: Suez Canal: China, Russia, and Egypt are forming alliances, exploiting perceived U.S. weakness. Strait of Hormuz: A potential U.S.-Iran conflict could disrupt 30% of global oil shipments, devastating Europe. Strait of Malacca: China is building rail bypasses to reduce reliance on this chokepoint. Whatâs Next? With Trump pushing tariffs and Bidenâs passive stance, the U.S. risks losing its grip on global trade routes. Meanwhile, Chinaâs "debt-trap diplomacy" and infrastructure investments are reshaping the Americasâfrom Panama to Argentina. As Yon starkly put it: "If China takes the Panama Canal, they can strangle us to death." The question is: Will Washington wake up before itâs too late?

Strait of Malacca: China is building rail bypasses to reduce reliance on this chokepoint. Whatâs Next? With Trump pushing tariffs and Bidenâs passive stance, the U.S. risks losing its grip on global trade routes. Meanwhile, Chinaâs "debt-trap diplomacy" and infrastructure investments are reshaping the Americasâfrom Panama to Argentina. As Yon starkly put it: "If China takes the Panama Canal, they can strangle us to death." The question is: Will Washington wake up before itâs too late? Watch the full episode of the "Health Ranger Report" with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, and Michael Yon as they talk about Panama, Pakistan, India, Russia and sea routes for energy and trade.

"The Chinese are taking over positions of power, mostly behind the scenes," Yon explained in an interview with Mike Adams on Brighton.com. "Theyâre building bridges, controlling ports, and subtly shifting demographicsâjust like they did in Hong Kong." U.S. Retreat, Chinese Expansion The Biden administration has continued the Obama-era policy of disengagement, while Chinaâs state-linked firms like Hutchison Ports now operate key terminals on both sides of the canal. BlackRock, a major U.S. asset manager with deep ties to China, has also sought to acquire these portsâraising concerns about de facto Chinese control over critical trade routes. Yon notes that Panamanian ship pilots guide every vesselâincluding U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriersâthrough the canal, a stark contrast to the past when American operators dominated. "The Panamanians ask, Where are the Americans? We left a vacuum, and China filled it," he said. Military and Economic Stakes The canal is not just an economic artery but a military lifeline for the U.S. Navy, allowing rapid deployment between the Atlantic and Pacific. If China gains dominance, it could strangle U.S. supply chains in a conflictâor even sabotage the canal by targeting the Gatun Dam, which, if destroyed, would drain the canalâs freshwater supply and shut it down for years. Trumpâs aggressive stanceâincluding threats to seize control of the canalâhas drawn mixed reactions. Some Panamanians welcome U.S. protection, while nationalists resist foreign intervention. "Panama is a juicy lamb surrounded by predators," Yon warned. "If the U.S. doesnât act, China or others will take it."

Title: Degrees without CAO points were meant to be a ‘game changer’. Why do so few students avail of them?

Cullain Burke’s delight with his Leaving Certificate results was short-lived. The 424 points he achieved in 2023 were not enough to secure his dream course, software development at Munster Technological University (MTU), which had soared above 500 points. “I was a little bit devastated to miss out,” he says. “It was upsetting. All my friends were going there. I had enough points for a business course, but I knew, really, it wasn’t something I’d be interested in.” As he weighed up whether to complete a post-Leaving Cert course, Burke was told of a brand new option: tertiary degrees. They are regular university bachelor’s degrees which begin in a further education college and finish up in a higher education institution. Entry is not based on CAO points and there are no tuition fees for the first one to two years. [ ‘No points needed, just potential’: Forty college degrees open for applicants outside CAO systemOpens in new window ] As it happened, there was a new tertiary degree in software development, with the first two years at Cork College of Further Education and Training and the final two years at MTU. “I thought, ‘there’s no way it’s real – it’s too good to be true’,” Burke recalls. “It’s far cheaper. It’s even closer to home. And it meant I’d have full access to all the facilities at MTU and could keep in contact with my friends.” Tertiary degrees were announced in a blaze of publicity three years ago by then minister for higher education, Simon Harris. They were, he said, a “game-changer” and had the potential to lift the stress on students forced to compete in a highly competitive CAO points race for college places. “These [tertiary] third-level courses challenge the notion that your Leaving Cert results should determine your education and career path, define a person or their capabilities, or get in the way of their dreams,” he said, shortly after the launch of the scheme. “With these courses I want to send a clear message to young people and their parents when considering options after school: you can be an engineer, a nurse, study business or work in ICT without ever having to worry about those archaic and stressful Leaving Cert points.” Yet, three years into the operation of the initiative, the numbers taking part are disappointing. A total of 152 students started courses during the first intake in 2023 across 14 different degrees. Last year the number climbed to 224 tertiary students. By comparison, the CAO this year received a record 83,000-plus applications, up from almost 77,000 last year. [ Could my son really lose a college offer if his CAO details are incorrect?Opens in new window ] So, why haven’t tertiary degree options caught the imagination of school leavers? One chair of a further education college board, who declined to be named, questioned the extent to which higher education institutions have bought into the scheme. “If you look at the courses on offer, they tend not to be the ones in high demand through the CAO,” the source said. “In many cases, they are courses the colleges are struggling to fill anyway. Until you see the really high points courses on offer, it won’t be the game-changer it was intended to be.” The most popular tertiary degree routes so far are for courses in nursing. While it used to attract high points, it has fallen to between 340 and 420 points in recent years. Some tertiary courses have not had any participants. Burke feels numbers taking part are relatively low because students are not aware of it, as well as a lingering stigma over further education being “second best”. “There can be a feeling that if you’re not going straight into [University College Cork] or MTU, then you’re not really progressing properly,” says Burke, from Blackrock in Cork. “This is completely not the case.” Another senior education observer points to the “rushed” manner in which tertiary degrees were introduced. [ Many apprentices are now on higher salaries than college graduates. Is snobbery around ‘earn and learn’ options fading?Opens in new window ] “I think Harris wanted it done in a hurry, with details to be thrashed out later. So, there are still unresolved issues around pay rates for staff in [Further Education and Training] colleges and poor linkages with traditional universities. Like it or not, they’re still seen as having a higher status.” There are some signs of change, however. University College Cork (UCC) is the first traditional university to offer tertiary degrees. One of its offerings is a BSc in occupational therapy, which had CAO entry points in excess of 500 points last year. Tanya Jones, deputy director of the National Tertiary Office, which oversees the roll-out of the new offerings, says demand is increasing. A total of 38 tertiary degrees are on offer this year across business, ICT, arts, engineering, social sciences, early learning & care, agricultural science, sport, construction and nursing. More programmes are now being designed in partnership with industry to tackle skills shortages and equip students for careers in sectors that need them. “Whether you’re finishing school, returning to education, or upskilling later in life, tertiary bachelors’ degrees are about meeting you where you are and helping you get to where you want to go,” Jones said. “Options and demand are increasing year on year, demonstrating the need for and importance of a more accessible route like the one presented by tertiary bachelors’ degrees.” These programmes ensure that your exam results won’t limit your options. If you’re willing to study and work hard, there’s a path for you in tertiary education. Nessa White, executive director for transformation at Solas, the State body which oversees the further education and training (FET) sector, adds that a key differentiating factor for tertiary degrees is that they are much more accessible. The fact that further education is available in almost every community across Ireland is, she says, creating a “supportive and tailored environment where people can develop their abilities and skills.” “This makes it a great platform for progression to higher education,” she said. Minister for Further and Higher Education James Lawless is convinced that the pathway will grow and give more students than ever the chance to pursue their ambitions without being tied down by the CAO points race. “I understand that many young people feel anxious about their educational future, worrying each year if their Leaving Certificate results will be enough to get into the course they want,” he said. “These programmes ensure that your exam results won’t limit your options. If you’re willing to study and work hard, there’s a path for you in tertiary education.” Burke, meanwhile, is on course to progress into the third year of his BSc in software development at MTU in September, having completed two years at Cork College of FET. He says he values the one-to-one help he received in a further education setting, while smaller class sizes in first year meant the transition from secondary school wasn’t as daunting. “If you need help in class, there’s never an issue. There’s a big emphasis on learning by doing ... you’re not just sitting in a lecture hall and listening.” While he knows some students have struggled in university, Burke feels he has a more solid foundation of learning. His dream of working as a data scientist is alive and well. “I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen to me to try this as an option. I’m excited to be gong to MTU in September ... I couldn’t recommend it highly enough.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump prizes more Gulf investment in the US
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk2me7vjxxo
Time Published: 2025-05-11T23:44:47Z
Full Content:
With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy. "President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US]," says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank. "He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing." Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May. The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April. Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico. Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his "America First" agenda is delivering results. The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton. The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years. Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (£450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment. According to Ali Shihabi – a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government – a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip. "These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods," says Mr Shihabi. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid. Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington. Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken "with a little bit of a grain of salt". Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items. These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft. The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen. The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder. The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction. Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a "more efficient procurement system", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily. "The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately," he adds. Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil. The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub. Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states. The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE. "For the UAE, this is absolutely essential," says Ms Young. "They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best." While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program. Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil. It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports. However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital. The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals. Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth. The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output. Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices. Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing. The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries. It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education. "The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies," Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC. Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit. For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda. "President Trump is looking for a headline of big investments in America, and he will get that from this trip," adds Mr Shihabi. The US president has agreed to "say hello" to Syria's interim leader during his tour of the Middle East, the White House says. The short rental firm says it is aiming to offer a wider range of experiences for travellers. The US president gets a "lavender-carpet" reception on a whirlwind visit of Gulf countries mainly focused on shoring up investment. US President Donald Trump has said the US has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia during his first major foreign trip. The planned layoffs mean the Japanese carmaker has now cut about 15% of its workforce in the past year. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: How To Invest In Web3 In 2025

Time Published: 2025-05-11T13:00:00Z

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. Web3’s growth is transforming industries, from finance to gaming. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, where decentralized networks, blockchain and digital assets reshape how we interact, own and transact. As interest grows, investors are exploring ways to get started, with choosing the right Web3 wallet being a key first step. This guide covers secure asset management, digital assets, DeFi, and the intersection of AI and blockchain. In 2025, Web3 is a key part of the digital economy, with blockchain technology powering applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Major institutions like BlackRock have embraced its potential, with CEO Larry Fink comparing tokenization to “email itself” for assets. Real-world assets, such as stocks and real estate, are now easily tokenized and traded, offering faster, transparent transactions. Regulations have also improved, with discussions around clearer frameworks for blockchain, and U.S. lawmakers proposing bipartisan laws for digital assets. This regulatory progress and institutional adoption have made Web3 more secure and accessible for investors. Investing in Web3 offers access to a rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized technologies that aim to transform industries ranging from finance and gaming to supply chain management and digital identity. Web3 assets, including cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance tokens, and non-fungible tokens, provide opportunities for diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Beyond diversification, Web3 investments can offer enhanced security, transparency and control over assets. Blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and verifiable, while decentralized platforms reduce reliance on intermediaries. As regulations become clearer, more institutions implement Web3 and new use cases appear, investment opportunities in the space keep growing. Investing in Web3 in 2025 offers a wide range of options, each catering to different interests and risk levels. You can buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, explore decentralized AI platforms or invest in tokenized real-world assets like real estate. DeFi lets you earn interest or borrow without banks, while Web3-related stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) provide indirect exposure to digital assets. Play-to-earn gaming allows you to earn crypto through gameplay, and joining decentralized autonomous organizations offers a chance to participate in Web3 governance and decision-making. Understanding these options can help you build a diversified Web3 investment strategy. Cryptocurrencies are a direct way to invest in Web3. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, while Solana offers fast transactions for decentralized apps. Stablecoins like USDC maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional currencies. Investors can buy cryptocurrencies on exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken and store them securely in Web3 wallets like MetaMask or Ledger. Since anyone can create a cryptocurrency, thorough research is essential. Evaluate each project’s team, technology, and security measures to avoid scams and protect your assets. Investing in decentralized AI is a way to support and profit from the next wave of artificial intelligence without relying on big tech companies. One of the best examples is Bittensor, a blockchain-based platform where anyone can help build and improve AI models. Instead of being controlled by a single company, Bittensor is a network where people can earn TAO tokens by creating, testing or refining AI tools. Bittensor’s unique setup uses “subnets,” which are smaller communities that focus on specific AI tasks, like language translation or image recognition. These subnets compete to provide the best results, and those who contribute useful work earn rewards. This decentralized approach makes Bittensor different from traditional AI companies, giving users more control and allowing anyone to take part. If you believe in the future of AI and want to invest, owning TAO tokens or supporting active subnets can be a good way to get involved. Real-world assets are physical or traditional financial assets represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. These can include anything from real estate and commodities to stocks and bonds. There are two main types of RWA tokens: fungible tokens, like ERC-20, which represent divisible assets (such as currencies or gold); and non-fungible tokens (NFTs, like ERC-721), which are used for unique assets like real estate or fine art. Tokenizing these assets allows them to be bought, sold and traded quickly and securely on blockchain networks. Investing in RWA’s through Web3 has several advantages. It makes these assets easier to trade, more transparent and more accessible. For example, instead of needing a large amount of money to buy an entire property, you can buy a small piece of it as a token. Blockchain technology also keeps records secure and accurate, making asset management simpler. As more assets get tokenized, this approach could become a central part of the Web3 world. Decentralized finance offers a way to invest in financial products without relying on traditional banks or intermediaries. Instead, DeFi uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized, transparent system where users can lend, borrow, trade and save with crypto assets. DeFi platforms, often accessed through dApps (decentralized applications), enable peer-to-peer transactions, instant loans and trading without brokers. Popular DeFi activities include lending crypto for interest, obtaining loans without paperwork, and trading assets directly with other users. Building on DeFi can include RWA’s. Tokenizing assets like real estate or commodities makes them usable within DeFi protocols, creating more liquidity and investment opportunities. For example, MakerDAO uses RWAs as collateral to issue its stablecoin, DAI. This blending of traditional and blockchain-based finance can lead to more diverse investment options while reducing systemic risks. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are online communities where members make decisions collectively without a central leader. They use blockchain technology and smart contracts which are automated programs carrying out actions when certain conditions are met. MakerDAO, one of the most well-known DAOs, runs on Ethereum and uses a protocol to maintain DAI, a cryptocurrency designed to match the value of the U.S. dollar without relying on banks or governments. Once you find a DAO that interests you, join the community, participate in discussions and complete tasks. Some DAOs require governance tokens, like MakerDAO’s MKR, which allows members to vote on proposals. DAI is created when users lock up assets like ETH as collateral, and members manage the system collectively to ensure DAI’s stability. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds offer a simple way to invest in bitcoin without directly owning it. These funds can be classified into two types: spot ETFs, which hold actual Bitcoin, and futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin price using contracts. Several Bitcoin ETFs offer diverse ways to invest in the cryptocurrency. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) focuses on futures contracts, while ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) provide direct spot exposure. Among them, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) by BlackRock stands out due to its market capitalization, making it the most popular option. Ethereum-focused ETFs are available, each offering a range of investment options. Investing in crypto ETFs provides benefits like diversification and liquidity, but it also involves risks, such as counterparty risk and a lack of direct asset ownership. While there are other crypto-based ETFs and more are expected to launch, they are not established as Bitcoin-based ETFs. Play-to-earn crypto gaming lets players earn digital assets like cryptocurrencies or NFTs through in-game activities. Unlike traditional games where achievements have no real-world value, P2E games reward players with assets they can own, trade or sell. Built on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, these games create player-driven economies where digital items hold actual value, making gaming a potential source of income. Popular P2E games include Axie Infinity, where players collect and battle creatures for tokens like SLP and AXS. In Decentraland, users can buy, sell and monetize virtual land using MANA tokens. The Sandbox offers a metaverse platform where players can create, own and trade digital assets using SAND tokens. These games show how blockchain technology can turn gaming into an investment opportunity. Investing in Web3 offers exciting opportunities but comes with significant risks. One of the critical challenges is security. Web3 wallets, which store digital assets, can be vulnerable to hacking, phishing attacks or user mistakes. Choosing a secure Web3 wallet is essential, but even the best options can be compromised if users don’t follow good security practices. And because Web3 is decentralized, there’s often no customer support to help if something goes wrong. Regulatory uncertainty is another challenge. While proposed U.S. legislation is being evaluated, a concrete structure has yet to be implemented. Market volatility is also a concern, with Web3 assets experiencing sudden price swings. Finally, with so many new projects launching, investors risk putting money into scams, poorly managed platforms or unsustainable ventures. Bottom Line Investing in Web3 offers exciting opportunities, but it comes with risks. Security is a major concern, so choosing a secure Web3 wallet and practicing safe habits is essential. Regulatory uncertainty and market volatility also pose challenges, making thorough research crucial for avoiding scams and making informed investment decisions. Web3’s growth is transforming industries, from finance to gaming. Popular options include crypto ETFs, play-to-earn games, decentralized finance and tokenized real-world assets. Understanding these options and their risks can help you navigate this rapidly evolving space. Web3 can be a good investment in 2025 for those who understand its risks and opportunities. While it offers access to innovative technologies and new financial models, investors must navigate security concerns, regulatory changes and market volatility. The best cryptocurrency to invest in is likely Bitcoin, given its proven track record and status as the most secure digital asset. For those considering branching out, it’s essential to understand your risk tolerance and thoroughly research each project before investing. To start investing in Web3, set up a secure Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask or Ledger, and choose a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken.

Title: Germany: New Merz cabinet raises concerns over lobbying

No sooner had Friedrich Merz announced new government positions than accusations of "lobbyism" began to fly. How is lobbying regulated in Germany — and how big a problem is it? Newly elected Chancellor Friedrich Merz, from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), himself a former lobbyist for global investment firm BlackRock, has taken the somewhat unusual step in German politics of appointing three people directly from the world of business to top cabinet jobs. The new minister of economic affairs and energy is Katherina Reiche (CDU), returning to government after a stint as managing director of the Association of Municipal Enterprises (VKU) and CEO of energy provider Westenergie, a subsidiary of one of Europe's largest energy concerns E.ON since 2020. The environmentalist Green Party, now back in opposition, has described her as a "gas lobbyist." Germany's new culture and media commissioner is media entrepreneur Wolfram Weimer, a former editor-in-chief of right-wing newspaper Welt with no previous experience in government of any kind. The Weimer Media Group founded by Weimer and his wife Christiane Goetz-Weimer hosts annual meetings where power players from business, politics and media gather to network. Since his appointment to the cabinet, Weimer has announced that his wife will now take over as sole managing director of the media group. The new minister for digitalization and state modernization, Karsten Wildberger, gave up his job as CEO of listed electronics retail group Ceconomy, parent company of two of Germany's largest consumer electronics chains MediaMarkt and Saturn, in order to take up his new job. Like Weimer, Wildberger has never been a politician, elected or otherwise. The socialist Left Party co-leader Ines Schwedtner criticized the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the CDU/CSU's coalition partner in government, for supporting what she called a "CDU lobbyist cabinet." While it's not the norm that people from business move straight into cabinet positions in Germany, it is becoming more common, according to Norman Loeckel, an expert on lobbying regulation at anti-corruption organization Transparency Germany. "It's actually better if you take someone who has the knowledge and expertise than a member of parliament who doesn't. But if there is a conflict of interest, that is a very critical situation and there are no rules curtailing this effectively in Germany," Loeckel told DW. Lobbying refers to the phenomenon of interest groups attempting to influence political decision-making in their favor, and is central to the functioning of a pluralistic democracy. Interest groups can include trade and consumer associations, NGOs, charities, foundations, churches, PR agencies that lobby on behalf of clients, think tanks and other research institutes, and state actors such as municipalities or federal ministries. As of 2022, lobbyists in Germany must register in a database called the Lobby Register. This includes all those who contact members of parliament, their staff, parliamentary groups and the federal government. But there are exceptions: Churches, trade unions and employers' associations are not required by law to register, although they may do so voluntarily. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Anyone who intentionally or negligently fails to register or update information correctly and completely, or not in a timely manner, could be prosecuted under the Lobby Register Act and be hit with a fine of up to €50,000 ($57,000). Donations to political parties over €10,000 must be published. It was also decided in 2021 that members of the Bundestag would have to declare company shareholdings and additional income of over €1,000 per month or €3,000 per year. Lawmakers also must abide by the Member of Parliament Act which regulates what secondary activities and income must be declared. It explicitly states that it is illegal to accept money or benefits of a monetary value in return for representing, promoting or protecting particular interests. Cabinet ministers are barred from working any type of second job under the Federal Ministers Act, even on a voluntary basis — but this does not apply to the majority of members of parliament who are not in the cabinet. Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers who want to switch from politics to business must notify the authorities if they intend to take up employment outside of the public sector. They can be subject to a mandatory "cooling-off" period of up to 18 months. In Germany, more lobbyists have access to the German Bundestag than there are members of parliament. There are currently almost 6,000 companies, associations, organizations, networks, individuals and others on the register — the list of designated employees who directly represent their interests numbers more than 27,000. Anti-corruption campaign groups, including Transparency Germany and Lobbycontrol, have also long called for the introduction of a so-called "executive footprint" documenting how federal bills came into being. The proposal has found its way into the rules of procedure for government ministries, but these rules are not binding and those who violate them do not face consequences. "In general in Germany, unless there is a big scandal, nothing happens. Almost all of the rules in Germany that limits lobbying, that bind politicians to certain rules, came into being because of a scandal," Loeckel told DW. The push for Germany's Lobby Register that led to its introduction in 2022 gained momentum in 2020 after CDU politician Philipp Amthor lobbied for US company Augustus Intelligence in return for stock options. Amthor also wrote letters to the Economy Ministry seeking "political support" for the startup of which he was also a board member. Cabinet ministers may be barred from having second jobs under the Member of Parliament Act, but this does not apply to other members of the Bundestag. Members of parliament are also not obliged to disclose any assets they or their family members own, aside from company shareholdings of over 5%. The Member of Parliament Act also does not apply to cabinet members like Reiche, Wildberger and Weimer who are not elected members of the Bundestag. "The only law that ministers have to obey is the Federal Minister Act. In reality the only real regulation is that cabinet ministers cannot have second jobs and that there must be a cooling-off period before switching from politics to business," said Loeckel. The cooling-off period was introduced in 2015 after a number of scandals, most prominently involving former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the SPD. Shortly before leaving office in 2005, Schröder signed a deal between Germany and Russian state-owned Gazprom to build the NordStream 1 gas pipeline, and then joined the board of directors of the NordStream joint venture. While the so-called "revolving door" between business and politics may be slowed by the cooling-off period, Transparency Germany wants this extended from a minimum of 18 months to a maximum of three years if conflicts arise. "In theory, you also have the code of conduct but it is not a law and you can break the rules and nobody will care. If there's no scandal there's no problem, at least from their point of view," said Loeckel.

Title: Corporate America’s DEI standoff: Why major companies are defying the backlash

Major companies like Costco, Apple, Leviâs and Goldman Sachs rejected shareholder proposals to dismantle DEI programs, despite conservative activism, showing a divide between political rhetoric and corporate governance. Large institutional investors (e.g., BlackRock, Vanguard) side with management, signaling Wall Streetâs belief in DEIâs financial benefits. While DEI opponents cite the Supreme Court's 2023 race-based admissions ruling, it doesn't apply to private companies. Meanwhile, Trump-era threats (e.g., federal contract losses) pressure firms like Meta to scale back initiatives. Anti-DEI groups use shareholder proposals to pressure companies (e.g., PepsiCo dropping minority representation goals), but many firms rebrand DEI efforts without abandoning core diversity commitments. Despite political backlash, 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts. The debate hinges on whether corporate Americaâs stance holds under escalating legal and political scrutiny.

Despite political backlash, 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts. The debate hinges on whether corporate Americaâs stance holds under escalating legal and political scrutiny. While the populist narrative claims that MAGA-aligned forces are dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across corporate America,Â some of the nation's largest companies are refusing to back down. Shareholders at Costco, Apple, Leviâs, John Deere and Goldman Sachs have rejected proposals to scrap DEI programs, despite pressure from conservative activists. In recent months, conservative think tanks like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) have spearheaded shareholder proposals demanding companies abandon DEI policies, citing legal risks and accusations of "reverse discrimination." At Costco, more than 98 percent of shareholders voted against a proposal to audit DEI-related business risks, with the board arguing diversity strengthens customer satisfaction. Similar defeats unfolded at Apple, Levi's and Goldman Sachs. (Related: Meta scraps DEI initiatives amid broader corporate retreat from diversity policies.) Why DEI still has corporate backing DEI programs encompass hiring practices, leadership training and supplier diversity efforts aimed at increasing representation for women, minorities, veterans and people with disabilities. CriticsÂ like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO and close advisor to President Donald Trump, say DEI represents "reverse racism." Major institutional investors â BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street â control vast voting shares and typically side with management. Their resistance to anti-DEI measures suggests Wall Street sees financial value in these programs, regardless of political headwinds. Opponents claim DEI violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against race-based college admissions. However, that decision applies only to public institutions, not private corporations. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has aggressively targeted DEI, pressuring companies like Meta and Target to scale back initiatives under threat of lost federal contracts. Yet, shareholder votes reveal a disconnect. While some firms quietly retreat, others â like Costco and Cisco â are digging in. Conservative groups admit their proposals are less about winning votes and more about applying pressure. The NLPC withdrew a similar motion at PepsiCo after the company agreed to drop minority representation goals for managers. Despite political rhetoric, DEI isnât disappearing. Companies are rebranding initiativesâdropping the term "DEI" while maintaining diversity hiring pipelines. A Paradigm survey found 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts, even if they're less vocal. In the coming weeks, Attorney General Pam Bondi is expected to submit a report with recommendations to "encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI,"Â including each agency's list of up to nine civil compliance investigations. For now, corporate America's message is clear: DEI may be controversial in politics, but in the boardroom, it's still seen as good business. The fight over DEI is far from over, but the latest shareholder votes prove corporate America isn't capitulating to political pressure. One thing is certain: the debate over DEI will define not just workplaces, but the future of American capitalism itself. President Donald Trump sends DEI to its end. Watch this video.

Title: Obituary: David Doyle, businessman and son of of legendary hotelier whose time in charge of the family business repeatedly hit the headlines

Time Published: 2025-05-11T01:30:00Z
Full Content:
David Doyle became a shrewd investor and a successful hotelier David Doyle, whose ­private funeral was held in ­Dublin last Thursday, was the younger son of legendary hotelier Pascal Vincent (PV) Doyle and took over the mantle of running the Doyle Hotel group for a time following the sudden death of his father, who had built the international chain of hotels from scratch. Mr Doyle, who lived between his home in Spain and his mansion on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin, died at the age of 67 on May 2 after living with motor neurone disease for some time. David Doyle was the second youngest of the five children of the builder and hotelier PV Doyle and his wife Margaret: Michael, Eileen, Anne, David and Bernadette. He grew up in the family mansion, Thornhill, in spacious grounds in Mount Merrion, Co Dublin, beside the Cherrygarth Estate which his father built. He went to school in Blackrock College and the College of Catering in Cathal Brugha Street, Dublin. Although born with the proverbial silver spoon, David, like his siblings, was expected to work in the family business. From about the age of 12 he learned his trade in the kitchens and bars of the Doyle hotels, ­before going to the US to work in the ­famous ­Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los ­Angeles. I can’t honestly say that there was a time when I didn’t want to go into the hotel business On returning to Dublin, he was appointed an assistant manager in his father’s flagship hotel, the Berkeley Court in Ballsbridge, built in the grounds of the former Trinity College Botanical Gardens and, in the mid-1980s, it was the most stylish hotel in Dublin. “I can’t honestly say that there was a time when I didn’t want to go into the hotel business,” he later admitted. When PV died suddenly in 1988 at the age of 64, it seemed the ­pecking order within the family had ­already been settled. Although he left everything to his wife Margaret, ­David became chief executive of the hotel group, with his younger sister Bernie (Bernadette) retaining her ­position as international marketing executive and second in command. Their elder brother Michael had taken over the building arm of the family business. “David and Bernie complemented each other and they were exceptionally close,” said one insider at the time. “He was running the business and she was marketing manager and they had offices next door to each other in the Burlington Hotel. It seemed like the ideal way to run the business.” His best friend at the time was ­another ambitious young Dublin ­hotel executive, John Fitzpatrick, whose ­father, Paddy, was a well-known figure in the hotel business. Their sons hung out with a “rat pack” of well-heeled bachelor friends. John Fitzpatrick returned from New York, where he had been ­dispatched by his father to open and run Fitzpatrick’s Hotel in Manhattan, to be best man when David Doyle married former air hostess Christina Kelly at a lavish wedding in Dublin. Some of his friends, who included Gerry Purcell, Michael Smurfit Jr, John Gallagher, Des McEvaddy and Paul Doody, hired a small aeroplane to fly over the church in Foxrock trailing a banner saying “your goose is cooked” that Saturday, May 4, 1991. However, over the next two years tensions within the Doyle family began to manifest, with his three sisters — including Bernie who was now married to John Gallagher — unhappy at the direction the business was taking. “It was generally felt in the industry that David and the family had a falling out over his policy of heavy investment in the existing hotel properties,” reported The Irish Times. Adding to the tension was David Doyle’s confidence in his own ability. “PV was frequently described paradoxically as a benevolent autocrat. Unfortunately, David appeared to have inherited his father’s iron will and tendency to take decisions without bothering too much about extensive consultations,” read one profile. David Doyle also wanted to team up with the worldwide Marriott chain to put the brand name on some of the hotels in the group. This did not find favour with the family matriarch, Margaret, who ultimately controlled the business and regarded “Doyle” as a ­better calling card. After a series of boardroom clashes David called senior hotel staff together on the evening of Wednesday June 15, 1994, and with tears in his eyes told them he was leaving the family ­business. “It is no secret in the financial world that PV’s widow ­Margaret and her five children and their respective wives and husbands are deeply divided,” wrote Sunday ­Independent social diarist Trevor Danker, later that year. Then just as suddenly as he had left to “pursue other interests”, the Doyle Hotel Group announced that David Doyle was back. Under the new arrangement his mother gave up her controlling interest to her five children. David became managing director, with Bernie taking the role of deputy chairman. Executive Paddy Galvin, who had run Waterford Glass, was appointed chairman. Some years earlier David had been asked about how he got on with other members of his family, particularly his father: “Every day we have hundreds of disagreements — that’s what business is about,” he answered. Within a short time fundamental differences resurfaced. Elder brother Michael made it clear as soon as the in-fighting resumed that he wanted out. It is estimated that he got over £20m, with his share of the company divided among the remaining siblings. ­David offered to buy out his sisters for £100m. They turned him down. On July 4, 1997, it was announced in a terse statement that the board of the company had voted him out of office and Bernadette would resume the position. Two years later the family reached a settlement and David sold out all but a small percentage of his holding for £40m. He spent the remainder of his life as a shrewd investor in a range of business ventures in Ireland and abroad. He would figure briefly in another corporate battle. In 1999 the Doyle sisters agreed to merge with their Ballsbridge rivals to form a public company, Jury’s Doyle. Between them they walked away with £398m in cash and retained a 23pc stake in the new company, making them three of the richest women in Ireland. The only stipulation PV’s widow made to the deal was that her husband’s portrait should continue to hang in pride of place in the lobbies of the hotels he had founded. In 2005, what became known as the Battle of Ballsbridge commenced as canny developers realised some of the sites in the Jury’s Doyle hotel group were worth more than the buildings that occupied them. As 13 rival consortia hoovered up shares in Jury’s Doyle, the prime site, Jury’s Hotel, was put up for sale. In the end it was sold to developer Seán Dunne for €275m, and he threw in another €119m to acquire the adjacent Berkeley Court Hotel. In return he sold a huge parcel of shares in Jury’s Doyle back to the three Doyle sisters, who got most of their father’s hotels back and realigned the business as The Doyle Collection. When David Doyle sold his 1.2 million shares in Jury’s Doyle back to his sisters, he is believed to have netted another €40m, as the shares were driven sky high in the bidding war. David Doyle lived well off the fortune he made from the family business. His brother Michael was mentioned in his death notice, but not his three sisters. He died in Spain and is survived by his wife Christina and their daughters Ashley and Sophie. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock Meets With SEC To Discuss Staking, Tokenization, Others – Details

Time Published: 2025-05-10T22:00:09Z
Full Content:
Executives of American investment firm BlackRock met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‘s crypto task force on Friday to discuss various matters pertaining to cryptocurrency spot exchange-traded products (ETPs). This discussion, among other recent developments in the administration of US President Donald Trump, represents the growing American interest in the crypto industry. According to a memo released by the SEC on Friday, BlackRock representatives met the agency’s crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Pierce, to “address several issues related to regulation in crypto assets.” In particular, the briefing between both parties touched on staking in ETFs, which has become a major talking point in recent months. In particular, BlackRock sought to discuss the Commission’s perspective on staking and the potential for permitting exchange-traded funds with staking options. Notably, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed for a proposed rule change in February that will introduce staking in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. If the SEC approves this application, Grayscale would be allowed to lock up portions of the crypto assets in its ETF holdings to generate additional income for the Trust. In April, the SEC delayed a decision on this request. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously stated there is much potential for the Commission to hold approval until the final deadline in October, despite the intermediate deadlines in May and August. In addition to Grayscale, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) has also filed a similar request for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. Aside from staking in ETFs, BlackRock and the SEC also conversed on ways of advancing the tokenization of securities in line with existing federal securities laws. Notably, BlackRock offers the BUIDL token, which is a tokenized money market fund that invests in high-quality government securities such as treasury bills. Furthermore, both parties also discussed the need for clear standards that determine the rejection or approval of a crypto ETP, which would also consider the provisions of Section 6 of the Exchange Act that ensure ETP trading will only happen on a regulated exchange. While this framework is being drafted, BlackRock also proposed the creation of a temporary regulatory system for ETP issuer activity. The final talking point between both parties explored the requirements for setting positions and exercise limits on crypto ETPs trading options, with a focus on how the liquidity of the underlying assets influences those limits. At presstime, the total crypto market is valued at $3.22 trillion following a 1.19% gain in the past day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Files For In-Kind Creation/Redemption For Ethereum Spot ETF – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-in-kind-creation-redemption-ethereum-etf/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T19:00:25Z
Full Content:
American investment firm BlackRock has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that will allow the in-kind creation and redemption of its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). This development comes three months after the asset manager made a similar application for its Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 9, BlackRock filed an amendment to the S-1 form of the Ethereum spot ETF ETHA that would permit an in-kind creation and redemption process for the fund. For context, crypto spot ETFs generally operate a cash creation and redemption process where authorized participants exchange cash for shares of an ETF. At the point of redemption, these shares are returned for the equivalent of their cash value. However, in an in-kind system, shares are directly exchanged for the base cryptocurrency between investors and the ETF issuers. This system allows ETF issuers to directly increase their cryptocurrency holdings without parting ways with any available cash. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, BlackRock’s application represents the first to push for in-kind creation/redemption in Ethereum ETFs after the asset manager filed a similar one for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in January 2025. Notably, there is a final deadline around November 10, 2025, at which the SEC is expected to give a definite response to this proposed change on BlackRock’s ETHA. In BlackRock’s S-1 amendment for an in-kind creation/redemption system, the asset manager highlights multiple risks, which can be described as the conventional risks all investors should know before directly or indirectly engaging with the crypto market. In particular, James Seyffart draws attention to a whole paragraph on the risk of Quantum computing. Here, BlackRock warns that significant advancements in Quantum computing in the coming years might provide opportunities to attack the cryptographic algorithm of digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, thereby undermining the assets’ security. Although there are steps by certain network members to create a cryptographic algorithm that would be immune to Quantum computing developments, there is little evidence to show that such Quantum-proof systems can be completely built or even implemented without causing network forks. However, Seyffart tells investors that there is no cause for alarm; these are part of the basic risks of digital assets, which BlackRock is mandated to disclose. Other dangers mentioned in the amendment proposal include potential exchange collapse, e.g, FTX, governance policy, and volatility. At press time, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,347 following a 28.38% gain in the past week. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 48.38% on its monthly chart amidst a general crypto market resurgence.
