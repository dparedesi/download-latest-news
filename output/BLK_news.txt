About us Copy link Ethereum is waking from its slumber, one analyst says. Two years ago, when Ethereum traded at $1,600 and faced mounting competition, Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, called it crypto’s “sleeping giant.” Now, he’s pointing to three converging catalysts that make Ethereum’s investment case one that’s “compelling for long-term holders.” “One enduring lesson I’ve learned from navigating crypto markets over the last decade is that transformative ecosystem shifts often unfold during periods of apparent quiet,” Kerbage wrote in an August 27 note to investors. “My expectation is that ETH can surpass $10,000 once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for US payments.” Kerbage’s latest note came days after Ether broke a new price record. Until then, the token’s price performance was lacklustre this year compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP and Solana. But nowadays, the tide seems to have turned. Fresh regulation surrounding stablecoins, the surge of Ethereum treasuries, “relentless bids” into exchange-traded funds, and the rise of staking yields are driving Ether’s growth. Today, Ether trades at about $4,400, up 83% in the past year. Market watchers are predicting it will trade at $7,500 by years-end, or even at $20,000 at some point in this cycle. Here’s the three reasons why Kerbage sees Ethereum’s price going higher. First, staking. Investors love yield-bearing assets, and Ethereum’s staking model offers exactly that but in crypto form. Nearly 36 million Ether are now staked, according to the Ethereum Foundation, representing nearly one-third of the network’s total supply. “This growth reflects heightened network security and investor confidence, with staking rewards averaging a 2.9% APR, appealing to yield-focused portfolios,” Kerbage noted. Kerbage isn’t the only market watcher who thinks staking will drive a lot of Wall Street interest for Ethereum. For Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, Ethereum is a stronger corporate play than Bitcoin. “Investors will lean into Ethereum not just so that it can appreciate in price alone, but because someone is doing something with that to generate yield,” Park said. Institutions have been pouring in, with ETFs now holding $24 billion in Ether, according to Coinglass. Some analysts predict large entities will hold 10% of the total supply. Tokenisation is the second driver behind the price, Kerbage said. The tokenisation of real-world assets on Ethereum has blown past projections, reaching $24 billion by mid-2025 — up from just $5 billion in 2022. Moreover, Bank of America forecasts the market will hit $16 trillion over the next five to 15 years. At current growth rates, however, that timeline looks conservative. “That vision is materialising faster than anticipated,” wrote Kerbage. Value stored in RWAs sits just above $15 billion, according to DefiLlama, with Ethereum accounting for $11 billion. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called tokenisation a potential finance revolution in 2023, reiterated his bullish stance this year, wrote Kerbage. His firm’s own tokenised fund, BUIDL, is the largest in the sector, with $2.2 billion. Kerbage expects the Genius Act to bring even more froth to the sector, as “stablecoins are set to boom.” In third place, there’s the youngsters. Over 50% of Gen Z now owns crypto, with $100 trillion set to move from older to younger generations over the next two decades. “This shift mirrors historical tech adoption — credit cards in the 1990s or the internet’s rise,” Kerbage observed. “Skepticism from older cohorts persists, but a decade into its existence and Ethereum’s utility is undeniable, much like how we now can’t imagine life without smartphones.” Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

Title: Ørsted sues Trump administration for halting $1.5bn offshore wind project
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/04/orsted-sues-trump-administration-for-halting-15bn-offshore-wind-project/
Time Published: 2025-09-04T15:37:53Z
Full Content:
Ørsted has taken legal action against US president Donald Trump’s administration in an effort to restart work on a nearly completed offshore wind project halted by the US government last month. The troubled Danish renewable energy company is seeking a court order that would let it finish its $1.5 billion (€1.3 billion) Revolution Wind project, which was meant to supply enough power for 350,000 homes in north-eastern US. But the US move to halt the development, driven by Mr Trump’s deep scepticism about wind power, has hit Ørsted’s business and sent its shares to record lows. Ørsted said in the court filing on Thursday that the stop-work order was “arbitrary and capricious” after the company and its partners had spent billions of dollars on approvals. It is one of a series of orders issued by the Trump administration aimed at blocking new offshore wind projects, which the president has described as the “scam of the century”. The Ørsted lawsuit comes a day before the company holds an emergency shareholder meeting in Copenhagen aimed at approving a 60 billion Danish krone (€8 billion) rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet, which has been badly damaged by the Trump administration’s repeated attacks on the industry. Ørsted shares are down 38 per cent this year to DKr199 on Thursday. The Danish state and Equinor, Ørsted’s two-largest shareholders with 50 per cent and 10 per cent stakes respectively, have backed the rights issue, as has Norway’s $2 trillion oil fund, which owns 3 per cent. Equinor has itself sued the Trump administration over a stop-work order on its own Empire Wind project. It later dropped the action after the US lifted the order as New York’s governor opened up for more gas pipeline capacity. Norway mustered a big diplomatic push over the affair, including using Jens Stoltenberg, a former head of Nato who is now the country’s finance minister. But Denmark is more exposed as it is already in a major diplomatic stand-off with the US over Trump’s insistence that he can gain control over the Arctic island of Greenland from Copenhagen. While Ørsted executives and Danish officials have tried to work out what Trump might require to restart Revolution Wind, which is 80 per cent complete, they and the wider industry have become increasingly fearful that the US administration is ready to intensify its attacks. Court filings issued in the US in recent weeks show the administration is working to withdraw permits from at least two wind farm developments off the coast of Massachusetts. These are SouthCoast Wind, being developed by France’s Engie and EDP Renewables, and the New England Wind 1 and 2 projects being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. Ørsted has a second unfinished project in the US, Sunrise Wind, and some investors worry it could also become a target. The Danish group owns a 50 per cent stake in Revolution Wind, the rest being owned by a unit of BlackRock, but it owns 100 per cent of Sunrise, and its difficulties in selling down that stake are what led to the rights issue. Doug Burgum, US secretary of the interior, has defended the suspension of work on Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns, including the possibility that undersea drone attacks could be launched through a wind farm. “People with bad ulterior motives against the US would launch a swarm drone attack through a wind farm. The radar gets very distorted,” he said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Dutch Pension PZFW Terminates BlackRock, AQR, L&G Mandates Amidst Portfolio Reshuffle
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/dutch-pension-pzfw-terminates-blackrock-aqr-lg-mandates-amidst-portfolio-reshuffle/

The Dutch pension fund for the health care industry, Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzij, known as PFZW, has terminated BlackRock Inc., AQR Capital Management LLC and Legal & General Investment Management as equity managers. “PFZW has been developing a new investment strategy where financial performance, risk and sustainability are weighed equally within the framework of a total portfolio approach,” a spokesperson for PFZW said. Spokespeople for the fund told Dutch publication NRC that the fund removed thousands of companies in which it had invested as it makes a switch from a largely index-based passive equity portfolio to an actively managed one, in order to gain more insights into and influence over the companies in which it invests. The fund will continue to use several managers across its 50-billion-euro ($58.37 billion) equity portfolio, including internal asset manager PGGM, Lazard, UBS, M&G, Robeco, Man Numeric, Acadian and Schroders. PFZW completed the selection process for its external managers in the first half of 2024 and began executing mandates in January. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  “We have appointed external managers whom we believe are best positioned to carry out PFZW’s assignment under the Investment Policy 2030: delivering market-based returns for a good pension, with an appropriate risk profile and a desired level of sustainability,” a spokesperson for PFZW said. PZFW, which manages 247 billion euros in assets, will continue to invest with BlackRock through a money market fund. “BlackRock clients—including our Dutch clients—continue to invest through BlackRock to meet their sustainable investing goals, entrusting us to manage over $1 trillion in sustainable and transition assets on their behalf,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said. The spokesperson said the firm noted PFZW’s redemption in the first half of the year. NRC reported that PFZW’s discussions with American asset managers on the topic of sustainability became difficult, and firms did not want to face pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump, one increasingly hostile to such investing initiatives. The publication noted these managers were also more hesitant to vote shareholder proxies in favor of sustainability resolutions at shareholder meetings. “PFZW have always voted their portfolio with BlackRock themselves,” the BlackRock spokesperson said. “For eligible clients who wish to participate in the stewardship of their assets, we have built the industry’s largest voting choice program, as well as a climate and decarbonization stewardship program for those clients who choose to prioritize those investment outcomes.” A spokesperson for L&G emphasized its sustainability bona fides. “L&G is a committed global leader in responsible investment,” the spokesperson said. “It is central to the way we drive long-term value creation for our clients, which is why we incorporate it into our investment decisions and stewardship activities. This includes our ongoing work with clients like PGGM, where our relationship remains as strong as ever across asset classes including in other sustainable investment strategies.” Under the Dutch Pensions Act, pension funds in the Netherlands are required to report how their investment policies consider environmental, social and governance factors. BlackRock faces criticism from both proponents and opponents of sustainable and responsible investing, and the $11 trillion asset manager has become a target both as a firm not doing enough to support sustainable initiatives and as one pushing a climate-focused agenda. Earlier this year, BlackRock and several other asset managers left the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which sought to achieve net-zero portfolio emissions among its members. BlackRock’s exit was one of the last before the initiative was frozen. As a result, Dutch pension fund PME Pensioenfonds announced it would review the 5 billion euros it had invested with BlackRock. The pension fund has stated that a decision about its continued work with the manager would be made this year. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s one-time membership in NZAM and similar initiatives was a sufficient reason for some state and federal U.S. lawmakers and asset owners to put the asset manager on notice or divest from it completely. The Texas comptroller’s office, in June, removed BlackRock from a list of companies alleged to boycott the oil and gas industry. BlackRock was also named in a multi-state lawsuit, along with State Street and Vanguard, alleging the trio conspired to suppress the coal market. The Indiana Public Retirement System terminated BlackRock as a fixed-income manager in December 2024 to follow state law after it was determined asset manager had ESG commitments—despite INPRS staff noting no concerns with the performance of BlackRock’s fixed-income strategy.

Title: BlackRock details a trade designed to capitalize on a US dollar that will stay historically weak for years
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-to-benefit-from-weaker-us-dollar-blackrock-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-04T13:58:21Z

Stocks outside the US have been big winners this year as factors like tariffs, rate cuts, growing government debt, and a decline in investor confidence have weakened the US dollar. BlackRock says the trend is likely just getting started. "We believe we are toward the beginning of a weaker dollar cycle, which has tended to boost international returns — potentially indicating a structural relationship change that requires investors to consider evolving portfolio construction," the firm said in an August 29 report authored by Gargi Pal Chaudhuri and Kristy Akullian. The continued: "The dollar has long benefited from a cycle of robust US growth and investment. But we think the structural bull market may be challenged amid current trade policy and demand for alternative reserve currencies." The numbers support this view. Dollar weakening cycles since the 1970s have lasted an average of eight years, the firm said. The current cycle is less than three years old. As for how to invest around the trend, the firm said that "unhedged international equities may stand to benefit the most from ongoing currency weakness." Investing in unhedged international stocks means having exposure to them in their local currencies. That way, if that currency rises relative to the dollar, your total return in dollars is larger. On the other hand, if the foreign currency falls relative to the dollar, it eats into your total returns. Investors can choose to hedge their investments in foreign stocks, which takes the currency volatility out of the equation. BlackRock has multiple unhedged international stock ETFs, like the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS). Other examples include the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Data shows investors are still overconcentrated in US stocks, BlackRock said. "The average advisor allocates 77.5% of their equity portfolio to the US, up from 70% in 2018," the firm said. But money is starting to move overseas, with the portion of ETF inflows going to international funds up to 29% from 12% in August last year. That has coincided with strong performance in overseas stocks. IXUS is up 20% in 2025 compared to the S&P 500's 9%. A Bank of America survey of fund managers earlier this year showed that 54% of the group thinks international stocks will be the best-performing trade over the next five years. In the case of a recession, BlackRock said that international stocks may be a better portfolio diversifier than US small-caps, which are subject to the same macro forces that large-cap US firms are. "Lower correlation and corporate reforms in certain parts of the world suggest that most investors could benefit unconditionally from owning more international stocks and seeking alpha in international markets as well as the U.S. markets," said Phil Hodges, co-lead of the Systematic Equities Macro Group at BlackRock, in a quote included in the report.

September 04, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: HRB Tax Group, Inc. HRB Tax Group, Inc. KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In response to the growing number of Americans struggling with financial health, Spruce, the mobile banking app built by H&R Block,1 announced today the launch of its Saving Surge Sweepstakes2. Saving Surge is a six-month initiative designed to reward and encourage consistent saving habits while giving people the chance to win their piece of nearly $5,000. With 70% of Americans identified as financially coping or vulnerable by the Financial Health Network,3 there is a clear need for innovative tools that help make money management simple and effective. Organized in partnership with national nonprofit, Commonwealth, which builds financial security and opportunity for financially vulnerable people and pioneered prize-linked savings in the U.S., the Saving Surge Sweepstakes is more than a contest — it is a movement to help Americans take control of their financial futures, starting with saving money. Beginning today through Feb. 28, 2026, Spruce customers can earn up to five entries each month by completing simple saving actions, such as setting up auto-transfers or depositing money in $10 increments into their Spruce Savings Account. Each month, four winners will be randomly selected — one to receive a $500 prize and three additional winners receiving $100 — directly deposited into their savings account. By encouraging small, consistent behaviors, Spruce is helping customers shift their mindset, grow their savings, and build long-term financial confidence. “The team behind Spruce believes that saving money is one of the most important steps toward being financially healthy and growing wealth,” said John Thompson, Vice President of Financial Services, Spruce. “The Saving Surge Sweepstakes offers a fresh, engaging way to show our customers how they can build better saving habits, one deposit at a time.” As part of Spruce’s ongoing commitment to helping customers build long-term financial security, the Saving Surge Sweepstakes complements the easy-to-use features and tools in the Spruce app such as the Watchlist Budget Tracker, and a Savings account plus two Spruce saving goals that can all earn a high-yield 3.50% APY4 (after opting in). These features reinforce positive financial behaviors and help make managing finances simpler and more accessible without the barriers often found on other platforms. "We’ve seen that when people have access to engaging tools and incentives, they’re empowered to make meaningful progress toward their financial goals,” said Commonwealth CEO Timothy Flacke. “We’re thrilled to collaborate with Spruce by H&R Block through our partnership in BlackRock’s Emergency Savings Initiative (ESI), which elevates awareness of the emergency savings crisis in the U.S. Spruce’s Saving Surge Sweepstakes not only specifically encourages consistent saving behaviors, it also leverages Spruce’s other financial tools to make the process of saving exciting and rewarding.”How to Participate To learn more about Spruce’s saving, budgeting, spending, and other financial-planning features, and how they are helping their customers stretch every dollar, visit www.SpruceMoney.com.

Title: The Digital Future: More Tech Unicorns From Islamic Founders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pklein/2025/09/04/the-digital-future-more-tech-unicorns-from-islamic-founders/
Time Published: 2025-09-04T12:19:05Z
Full Content:
ByPaul Klein, Contributor. A new generation of Islamic founders are building businesses that are highly profitable, anchored in Islamic moral principles and have the potential to help re-define the digital future. Historically, Muslim-majority countries have not produced tech unicorns with the same global impact achieved by entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Despite representing nearly one-third of the world’s population, there were only about six unicorns across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) versus more than a thousand worldwide in 2023, according to Fast Company Middle East. There are three primary reasons why tech unicorns have been rare in Islamic regions. Promising regional leaders often sell before going global. For example Careem, the “the everything app” for the Middle East was acquired by Uber for $3.1B. And, souq.com, once the Arab world’s largest e-commerce platform, sold to Amazon for $580M in 2017. While Tel Aviv, Dubai, and Cairo are seen as MENA’s leading ecosystems for entrepreneurs, the region still functions as multiple hubs rather than an integrated single market. Founders expanding across MENA and into South or Southeast Asia face a patchwork of languages, consumer behaviors, regulations and a lack of standardized Sharīʿah frameworks. Finally, there is regional tech talent but entrepreneurs are often drawn to markets like the U.S. where access to startup capital, mentors, and exit markets are deeper. There has been an increase in the local concentration of repeat founders and operators but research on immigrant entrepreneurship shows outsized innovation and firm-creation effects outside countries of origin. Despite the challenges, success stories are emerging and show the potential for success at scale. bKash, founded by Kamal Quadir, is a mobile financial service that has become Bangladesh’s first unicorn and has a valuation over $2 billion. GoTo, founded by Nadiem Makarim, is Indonesia's largest digital ecosystem and provides a wide range of services including e-commerce, ride-hailing, food delivery, and financial services. One reason why companies like bKash and GoTo are so successful is that the underlying demand is enormous and access to capital in Islamic regions is growing exponentially. Islamic finance assets reached $4.9 trillion in 2023 and could grow to $7.5 trillion by 2028, according to the ICD-LSEG Islamic Finance Development Report. Samuel Aziz Boubaous, founder of Dubai-based Wealth Consulting, is another entrepreneur that is helping to reframe what Islamic tech leadership can look like. “I want to build something which just inspires the Islamic world overall that they can do great things,” Aziz Boubaous said in a recent interview. His path into finance was unconventional. As a teenager he scaled a fitness-coaching business into millions in revenue before expanding into e-commerce and, eventually, advisory services. The through-line, he says, was discipline, a trait he learned in the fitness business. “If you box and fight and get beaten, then you actually see business problems as not a big problem—because getting a fist in your face and bleeding is still harder than failing in business.” Boxing taught Aziz Boubaous to take the punches; and entrepreneurship has taught him to keep moving. This is a playbook he believes is critically important for young founders: solve real problems (payments, working capital, cross-border trade), build with uncompromising transparency, and scale through collaboration. “If you’re building for others—not just for yourself—people feel it,” he said. “That’s when they trust you with big decisions.” His long-term vision is to create an Islamic bank that is both technologically world-class and spiritually grounded. He sees a profound gap: “Almost one-third of the world’s population is Muslim, but there is no serious financial infrastructure that reflects our values,” he explained. “We don’t have an Elon Musk or Warren Buffett in the Islamic world to inspire young people. I want to build something that shows them they can do great things too.” For Aziz Boubaous, a global Islamic bank is about more than just financial services, it is also about demonstrating what’s possible when business rigour is combined with moral purpose. His approach is rooted in years of solving banking, payment processing, and corporate structuring challenges for high-growth entrepreneurs. Aziz Boubaous calls his model “private processing”, a hybrid that fuses modern fintech and AI with the human connection of traditional banking. “When you combine old school support with modern technology, it has more value than ever before,” he said. He also grounds his work in Quranic principles such as intention, steadfastness, and uprightness. “Clients send millions through our platforms because they know we have the right intention,” he noted, emphasizing that spiritual grounding creates not only trust but also a competitive advantage. Ultimately, Aziz Boubaous envisions his Islamic bank as a catalyst for what he calls a “digital golden age.” “In Islam we had a golden age where science and business flourished but still with the right values. Now the future is digital—and I believe we can build a digital golden age, not digital destruction,” he said. By creating a financial institution that is both profitable and righteous, Aziz Boubaous hopes to inspire a generation of Muslim entrepreneurs to pursue global ambitions. “Maybe I won’t build the next BlackRock, but I can build something with positive influence and the right values,” he added Aziz Boubaous’ journey reflects more than just individual ambition; it underscores the untapped potential in Muslim-majority regions. Despite their vast populations, increasing youth population, and growing consumer markets, these regions have yet to produce a meaningful number of global tech unicorns. Aziz Boubaous argues this is not due to a lack of talent or ideas, but a lack of infrastructure and role models. “The IQ is not lower, the talent is not less—but the pathways are not as clear as in Silicon Valley or Wall Street.” His vision for a world-class Islamic bank is, at its core, about creating that missing pathway. An increase in tech unicorns could inspire confidence, channel capital into innovation, and provide young Muslim entrepreneurs with the kind of ecosystem that is fuelling tech breakthroughs elsewhere in the world. “By anchoring growth in both technology and values, the Islamic world can finally cultivate its own generation of unicorns,” said Aziz Boubaous. “Companies that achieve billion-dollar valuations and also serve as catalysts for a broader cultural and economic transformation.” Founders like Aziz Boubaous, Quadir, and Makarim are helping to redefine what tech entrepreneurship looks like. An increase in tech unicorns from Muslim countries may send a signal to the rest of the world that Islamic founders have found a way to lead the digital future.

Title: Ray Dalio says ‘most people are silent’ because they’re afraid to talk about what’s really happening with the U.S. economy

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has delivered a stark warning about the state of American discourse around the nation’s economic challenges, saying fear of retaliation, particularly from the Trump administration, is keeping investors and business leaders from voicing critical concerns about the country’s fiscal trajectory. The founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund with approximately $130 billion under management, told the Financial Times that the current political and economic environment resembles the troubling dynamics of the 1930s and 1940s. “Most people are silent because they are afraid of retaliation if they criticize,” Dalio said, highlighting what he sees as a dangerous suppression of economic debate at a critical juncture for the United States. Dalio’s concerns carry significant weight in financial circles. The 76-year-old investor built Bridgewater from his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment in 1975, growing it into a financial powerhouse that manages money for institutional clients including foreign governments, central banks, pension funds, and university endowments. His investment philosophy, based on analyzing cause-and-effect relationships throughout economic history, has earned him recognition as one of the most successful hedge fund managers ever. The Harvard Business School graduate’s track record includes successfully navigating major economic crises, including turning a profit during the 1987 stock market crash. His books on economic principles and market cycles have become essential reading for institutional investors, lending credibility to his current warnings about America’s fiscal health. Dalio’s alarm centers on what he describes as an impending “debt-induced heart attack in the relatively near future,” which he said could strike the U.S. economy within the next three years. The numbers support his concern: America’s national debt has reached a staggering $37 trillion as of August, representing approximately 124% of the nation’s gross domestic product—levels not seen since World War II. More troubling, the Congressional Budget Office projects the debt-to-GDP ratio will climb from 100% in 2025 to 156% by 2055 if current policies remain unchanged. Interest payments on this debt are consuming an increasingly large share of the federal budget, creating what Dalio likens to “a circulatory system riddled with plaque.” Adding to Dalio’s concerns is the current administration’s approach to Federal Reserve independence. President Trump has openly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and attempted to remove Governor Lisa Cook, moves that European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently warned could pose “very serious danger” to the global economy. Dalio specifically cited the government’s decision to acquire a significant stake in chipmaker Intel as an example of increasing state intervention in the economy, describing it as part of “strong autocratic leadership” aimed at controlling financial circumstances. Such interventions, he argued, reflect a broader shift toward the kind of economic authoritarianism that characterized much of the world during the 1930s and 1940s. The immediate economic landscape presents a complex picture that may be masking deeper structural problems. Inflation has moderated to 2.7% as of July, down from pandemic highs but still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Unemployment remains relatively low at 4.2%, though recent job growth has slowed significantly with only 73,000 positions added in July—the weakest performance in months. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index has declined for six consecutive months through July, signaling potential economic weakening ahead. Real GDP growth is projected at just 1.6% for 2025, slower than historical averages and reflecting the drag from higher interest rates and trade tensions. Dalio’s warning about widespread silence among business leaders and investors reflects what many see as a chilling effect on economic discourse. The fear of political or economic retaliation, he suggests, is preventing the kind of frank discussion needed to address America’s fiscal challenges before they reach a crisis point. This dynamic becomes particularly dangerous when considering that previous debt crises have often emerged suddenly when investor confidence erodes. Dalio pointed to the 2022 experience of British Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked markets so severely that the pound plummeted to historic lows against the dollar, forcing her resignation. As the U.S. approaches what could be a critical period for its fiscal health, Dalio’s warnings serve as a reminder that economic stability often depends on the willingness of leaders—both political and financial—to engage in difficult conversations about unsustainable trends. Whether his prediction of a “debt-induced heart attack” proves accurate may ultimately depend on breaking through the silence he describes. To be clear, Dalio isn’t the first prominent financial leader to warn about the silencing effects of the current political climate. In April, Citadel’s billionaire founder and CEO Ken Griffin said “shame on this administration” after Trump lashed out at Walmart after its CEO raised concerns about tariffs. Similarly, during an interview at the Economic Club of New York earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said most of the CEOs he meets with privately believe the U.S. is in a recession but won’t say so on the record, fearing political backlash and market repercussions. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Proposed Minnesota Power sale to BlackRock rouses concern

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT DULUTH — As a potential sale of Minnesota Power looms, a crowd of concerned citizens gathered at the company’s doorstep Wednesday afternoon to voice their concerns. On Sept. 25, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected to begin weighing whether to approve a $6.2 billion purchase of the Duluth-based utility by BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners with help from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. ADVERTISEMENT Jenna Yeakle, a Sierra Club staff member, told crowd members Wednesday: “I’m here with you all today to push back against this story that we have been told by Minnesota Power and their potential buyers that they need to be scooped up by BlackRock in order to achieve a carbon-free energy picture." To the contrary, Yeakle suggested the acquisition “could slow much-needed climate action and actually threaten our democracy.” But the utility would really benefit from some outside support to achieve its reduced-emission goals, according to Jen Cady, vice president of regulatory affairs for Allete Inc., Minnesota Power’s parent company. “The scale of what’s in front of us is really unlike anything the company has had to navigate in the past,” she said. Cady noted that Minnesota Power expects it will need to spend $5 billion in the next five years — a sum greater than it has had to raise in the past 75 years. “And these are the right partners to help us navigate that future,” she said. Cady also pointed out that Minnesota Power will continue to be governed by the state PUC and will need to justify any proposed future rate increases, regardless of its ownership. ADVERTISEMENT But Buddy Robinson, a member of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota who addressed the crowd as an individual Minnesota Power ratepayer, advised that the state PUC pay heed to a July 15 recommendation by an administrative law judge suggesting the acquisition should be blocked for not being in the public interest. “The key fact established in the proceedings is that BlackRock and CPP, as private equity companies, intend to increase rates faster than would happen otherwise,” he said. Robinson said this is the same reason large customers, including taconite and paper producers, have also lined up against the sale. He said that the economic power of BlackRock “boggles the mind,” with a portfolio of $11 trillion in assets — greater than the gross domestic product of all nations, except the U.S. and China. Angel Dubrow, another concerned customer and landlord, suggested higher electricity costs could drive up housing costs that are already unaffordable for many residents, especially as BlackRock and its partners seek to recoup a $1.5 billion premium they have offered to purchase Allete, above its market valuation at the time of the deal. But Cady predicted the new ownership would bring greater stability to Allete and its subsidiary, Minnesota Power. She noted that the company already is publicly traded on Wall Street, with its value largely determined by investors making quarter-to-quarter financial decisions. “Infrastructure funds and pension funds are inherently long-term investors,” she said. “They are looking to provide stable returns over a long period of time. And that investor expectation is much more closely aligned with the utility business, where we build big infrastructure that serves customers for decades.” ADVERTISEMENT Over the past 16 months, Cady said Allete has listened and worked to address customers’ concerns, signing an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that contains about 70 commitments, including a one-year base-rate freeze. Unfortunately, that agreement was signed just before the administrative law judge handed down her recommendation, and Cady suggested a close reading might have changed the outcome. “I don’t think the judge had adequate time to really evaluate all of the components of that settlement before her report was due,” she said, contending that the issues raised were pretty comprehensively covered. Yet, state Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, says her fears have not been allayed. “This proposed sale does affect the entire community,” she said. “The BlackRock Corp. controls trillions of dollars of assets internationally," she said. "So, when they become a 60% majority owner of our electric utility, the financial decisions they’re making — whether they be about business strategy, expansion, compliance with our clean energy laws here in the state of Minnesota, whether they honor union contracts, how they treat their workers, whether they go for a rate increase or how much — all of those decisions are going to also be affected by the forces that are coming down on that corporation from their international interests." McEwen predicted this structure would lead to “an inevitable conflict of interest.” ADVERTISEMENT “It is not always going to be in the financial interests of BlackRock to keep our rates as low as possible, to serve our community the electricity we need,” she said. “That’s not the business they are in. They are in the business of making profit from as many things as possible." ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Title: Coinbase Wallet Shows Massive XRP Cuts, What’s Going On?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-massive-xrp-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T22:00:23Z
Full Content:
Data shows crypto exchange Coinbase has made a surprising shift in its XRP holdings by reducing its stash from more than 780 million XRP to around 200 million in a matter of weeks. According to data from XRPScan, Coinbase’s total XRP holdings have fallen by a massive 69% from its most recent proof of reserve report. Notably, this cutback comes at a time when institutional players like BlackRock are increasingly intertwined with Coinbase’s operations Once the fifth-largest exchange holder of XRP, Coinbase has now slipped to tenth place after reducing its balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This represents a staggering 69% reduction since the second quarter of 2025, with a 57% plunge in just the past month. Such a huge cutback in Coinbase’s XRP holdings within a short period of time can only be attributed to outflows from institutional investors. At the time of writing, Coinbase has 11 cold wallets remaining, each holding 16.5 million XRP tokens. This is a massive fall from early June numbers of 52 cold Coinbase wallets holding a total of 970 million XRP, according to XRPwallets, an XRP commentator account on the social media platform X. Interestingly, XRPwallets also hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. BlackRock is a suspect due to the nature of its recent collaboration with Coinbase. That collaboration, which was announced in early August, was done to allow institutional investors easy access to digital assets directly through Coinbase. Although Bitcoin was initially the focus, the partnership has most likely expanded to XRP due to its growing demand among institutional investors. Right now, all that’s left in Coinbase’s XRP wallets might be mostly XRP held by retail traders. XRPwallets also speculated that other major exchanges, such as Uphold, Binance, and Upbit, could eventually show similar balances, around 200 million XRP each, once Ripple’s distributions move through the system. By their estimates, this would leave about 1 billion XRP across exchanges and another 900 million resting in retail cold wallets. Although the numbers were framed as guesses, they relate to the idea that institutional channels are absorbing XRP, leaving exchanges increasingly as platforms for retail activity. Interestingly, other crypto exchanges like Upbit and Uphold have also seen their XRP holdings fall massively within the same time period as Coinbase. Upbit, for instance, saw its XRP balance fall from 6.03 billion XRP to 5.84 billion XRP. Uphold, on the other hand, saw its XRP balance fall from 1.907 billion XRP to 1.746 billion XRP. XRP is still trading below the $3 resistance level after repeated rejections this month, which has left the crypto’s near-term trajectory in question. Reduced exchange balances often point to decreasing sell pressure, which could help support price stability. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, up by 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Last year's win against New Zealand took more out of Brittany Hogan than she had ever experienced in her rugby career. If Ireland are to pull off a repeat of last year’s epic win this weekend, she knows it will take even more. It’s not hyperbole. The stats back it up. Hogan made 19 tackles that night in Vancouver, more than any other Irish player, while only Niamh O’Dowd and Aoife Wafer logged more carries. "I always say that when we played New Zealand last year it was the hardest game I've ever played in my life," the Ireland number 8 said ahead of Sunday’s Rugby World Cup Pool C decider against the Black Ferns (2.45pm, live on RTÉ). "We all are all well aware that we're going to have to go to the well at the weekend, so we're fully prepared to have a big shift." The 26-year-old (below) has had to go to the well already in this World Cup. After a player of the match display against Japan, she was named among the replacements for last Sunday’s game against Spain, and was called in after just over 20 minutes when Sam Monaghan departed with a hip issue, but led Ireland with 14 carries despite only playing 56 minutes. The games are only getting tougher, with the defending champions this weekend followed by a quarter-final, and if they win that they’ll be staying in England for two more matches. Hogan insists there’s still plenty of petrol left in the tank. She said: "To be fair, it was a very high ball-in-play game [against Spain]. And Spain had so much possession on pick and goes, you just rack up tackles, you rack up those meters." With 36 caps to her name, the Blackrock and Ulster back row has been one of Scott Bemand’s most trusted forwards since he took charge two years ago, in part down to her ability to move between number 8 and blindside flanker. Wafer is yet to appear at this World Cup, so Hogan has been leaned on heavily across both sides of the ball in the opening two games, leading Ireland’s tackle (34) and carry (26) charts, while her 120 carry metres are the highest of any forward in the squad. "I've been trying to put myself into more of a ball carrying role because that's just the way that my game has developed," she said. "It's become sort of a strength of mine that the team and the coaches like to utilise. "So that comes hand in hand with [Aoife] Wafer, and if I have to latch Wafer, no problem. She's an incredible asset to our team. "Whenever she's gone, if I have to have a couple more carries I will, but we are spreading that across the team pretty well. "[It has been] organic, it just comes with my physical adaptations the past year and my awareness of the game and trying to just put my hand up and say, 'I'm carrying’ and people come around me. "I love carrying the ball. Give it to me any day. I'll do it. No problem." Almost a year on from that thrilling 29-27 win against New Zealand, the memories are still as vivid as ever. "It is going to be like that, essentially like a Croke Park feeling for these girls"@HannahOConnor22 on the unique vibe that will wait Ireland against New Zealand at Brighton's Amex Stadium #RWC2025 📺/🎧 #RTERugby Podcast: https://t.co/DbbgFFNsnf pic.twitter.com/EfLVo77Rut "The scrum in the midfield," Hogan said, when asked for her abiding memory. "And just saying to girls, all of us looking each other in the eyes and saying, ‘Right, New Zealand are going to come for us here, lock in and give it absolutely everything that you can’. "That moment and then Dannah [O’Brien] kicking it off, and just shock and then the changing-room afterwards. "I suppose it kind of kick-started our belief behind the group, behind the girls, behind the coaching staff. "It kick-started the IRFU putting loads more funding, loads more investment into us, everybody was on our train and on our wavelength then. "And I think that just after that New Zealand game, we knew that we could do it internally, but externally I think that just like put a rocket boost behind the team." Twelve months on from providing 2024's biggest shock in rugby, what are the chances they do it again? "We have that belief behind us that we are capable of doing it [again], and we're more than capable of doing it, but we are well aware that New Zealand are a world class outfit and it's going to be an incredibly tough game. "If we come out with the right side of the scoreboard afterwards, great, if we don't, that's fine as well. "But we all have that full belief and confidence that we are going to be able to pack a good performance and hopefully a good show for the crowd. "We know that they are able to show up in these competitions and they always do. I suppose that kind of fear factor wasn't really there [last year]. "We were more underdogs, we kind of had that, well, we've got nothing to lose kind of factor. "We've taken away the element of surprise. So now we just have to work that little bit harder."

Title: Anthropic Rakes in $183B Valuation as It Takes on Musk, Altman

Anthropic, the AI startup behind the Claude family of models, has secured a $13 billion Series F financing at a staggering $183 billion post-money valuation, nearly tripling its worth since March. Anthropic is backed by AmazonÂ and Google-parent Alphabet. The company said that the round was led by ICONIQ Capital and co-led by Fidelity and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with institutional heavyweights such as BlackRock, GIC, Qatar Investment Authority, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and Coatue among the backers. âWe are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base,â Anthropic Chief Financial OfficerÂ Krishna Rao said in a statement. âThis financing demonstrates investorsâ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.â In early 2025, Anthropicâs valuation stood at $61.5 billion following a $3.5 billion Series E round. Since then, the companyâs annualized revenue has surged from $1 billion to over $5 billion, attributed to rapidly growing enterprise adoption of Claude. Claude Code, Anthropicâs developer-focused AI assistant, has become a standout performer, generating more than $500 million in run-rate revenue within just a few months of its May launch. Its usage climbed over tenfold in that time. The company now services over 300,000 business clients, with accounts contributing over $100,000 in annual revenue, increasing nearly sevenfold. Investor enthusiasm remains palpable, pulling in capital from major sovereign wealth funds. The Qatar Investment Authorityâs participation signals growing geopolitical attention on AI infrastructure. Anthropic said it plans to deploy the fresh capital toward three core initiatives: enterprise scaling, AI safety research, and global expansion efforts that reinforce its positioning as a safe and capable alternative to consumer-facing rivals. Anthropicâs skyrocketing valuation underscores how investor appetite for AI overrides the traditional risk calculus. But as a private company far from IPO, questions around future profitability, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive threats, especially from OpenAI, xAI, and others, loom large. Despite the injections of capital and growth signals, the sustainability of ultra-high private valuations in the tech space has come under increasing scrutiny. Anthropic now sits among the most valuable private companies globally and faces pressure to deliver on the lofty expectations that such a valuation implies. OpenAI has secured $8.3 billion in new funding at a $300 billion valuation, part of a broader $40 billion financing drive slated for 2025. The companyâs annual revenue run rates are reported between $12 billion and $13 billion, with projections potentially reaching $20 billion by year-end. OpenAI is also exploring a $500 billion valuation via a secondary share sale for current and former employees, signaling investor enthusiasm for liquidity events. Elon Musk’s AI venture, xAI, merged with his social media company X in an all-stock deal that valued xAI at about $80 billion and X at $33 billion, for a combined enterprise valuation of $113 billion. Earlier, xAI had raised $10 billion in debt and equity financing, underscoring Muskâs aggressive push in AI.

Title: SharpLink makes $174 mln Ethereum gamble: Co-CEO warns of risks

SharpLink Gaming cements its second spot among Ethereum treasuries. Can they maintain this momentum? SharpLink Gaming acquired $174M worth of ETH, strengthening its spot among public treasuries. However, Co-CEO Chalom noted the risk associated with these treasury firms. This year alone, Ethereum [ETH] has seen about eleven U.S. institutions adopt ETH strategies, an honor that was initially reserved for Bitcoin [BTC]. On that note, SharpLink Gaming (SBET) took its total holdings to 837,230 ETH. This followed an announcement that they had acquired another 39,008 ETH, valued at $176.4 million. In total, the company added about 397,923 ETH in the last 30 days, per CoinGecko data. Their total holdings were at $3.66B at press time, about 0.694% of Ethereum’s total supply. SharpLink paid an average price of $3,603 per token since their July switch to a public company focused on ETH. The king of altcoin’s price of $4,366 indicated that they were in profits at press time. The firm’s concentration of Ethereum has risen by about 97% since early June. From the data on SharpLink Gaming, the company had earned 2,318 ETH in staking rewards, with their ETH NAV at $3.68 billion. About 860,369 ETH, valued at $3.7B, were waiting to be staked in September. Source; SharpLink Gaming However, despite the acquisition and strong fundamentals, their stock (SBET) continued to decline. The last 24 hours saw a drop of more than 4.71%, as price traded at $16.98, per Yahoo Finance data. Co-CEO Joseph Chalom said that Ethereum was embraced on Wall Street due to its security and liquidity. The staking component ensures the network remains secure, while its wide application across the crypto space offered liquidity. The former Head of Strategies at BlackRock explained that SharpLink raised $400M from Consensys and other institutions investors to buy ETH. They also raise money through an at-the-market program on a daily basis from new equity investors. The Ethereum is staked and provide yield to make it productive. However, Chalom noted the risk associated with ETH treasury firms in case of a massive market downturn. U.S. firms accounted for about 2.68% of the supply. SharpLink was second in terms of holdings, behind BitMine, which had more than double their amount. BitMine’s total was at 1.867 ETH worth $8.167 billion, which represented about 1.547% of total ETH supply. Coinbase, Bit Digital and ETHZilla wrapped up the top five, respectively. The total held by U.S. firms was at 3.233M valued at $14.15B, a 9.9% rise on the day. Source: CoinGecko Other jurisdictions like Hong Kong were also getting on board, with Yunfeng Financial holding about 10K ETH.

Hello there! Frustrated by the increase in tipping culture over the last few years? You're not alone. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said restaurants are "getting the customer to pay" for their workers with tipped wages. In today's big story, a judge ruled on Google's penalties for its online search monopoly. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Google is … feeling lucky? A judge's ruling on Google's penalties for its online search monopoly didn't leave the tech giant unscathed. Still, it largely avoided the severe punishments its prosecutor, the US government, was after. So how was Google punished? -Google can't negotiate exclusive partnerships to be the default search engine. As a reminder, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 alone to be Safari's default engine. -Google needs to share its search index and user-interaction data with competitors. Rivals will now have the benefit of training up their own models with some of the troves of data Google has collected. -Google has to provide syndication services to competitors looking to establish their own search and ads business. However, it can charge them for it. But it could have been a lot worse. -The judge rejected the biggest penalty prosecutors were after: a forced sale of the Chrome browser or Android operating system. -Google can also keep paying partners like Apple for distribution. The deals just can't be exclusive. -It doesn't need to share its highly valuable ads data with anyone. Don't take my word for it, though. As always, the markets are the true judge. Alphabet's stock rose as much as 8% in after-hours trading. The ruling also came with a unique twist. US District Judge Amit Mehta acknowledged that the fast-paced nature of tech, especially the recent rise of generative AI, had to be considered in the decision. In fact, in a roundabout way, rivals like OpenAI might have actually saved Google from facing far worse consequences, writes BI's Charles Rollet. Depending on who you ask, generative AI is already eating into Google's search business. So while Google has a monopoly now, that might not be the case going forward. The rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude is reshaping the competitive landscape in search. Penalizing Google now could hamstring it at a critical inflection point for tech. A significant gap still exists between a search giant like Google and up-and-coming chatbots. But Mehta acknowledged the AI startups could "end up being game changers." "Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future," Mehta wrote. "Not exactly a judge's forte." 3 things in markets 1. Summer's over. Wall Street is leaving vacation mode and entering a historically weak month for the stock market. That's coupled with a heavy load of economic data that's incoming. Here's what's on investors' radars this week. Meanwhile, investing pros shared four ways they're placing their bets. 2. Tech stocks are having a rough start to the month. The Nasdaq 100 slid as much as 1.9% on the first trading day of September, with heavy hitters like Nvidia and Amazon suffering steep losses. Investors are grappling with three factors heading into September. 3. Hedge funds are on track for a strong year. Large funds, including $68 billion Citadel, saw positive returns in August, people close to the money managers told BI. Multistrategy hedge fund managers outside the big four are continue their strong year as global stock markets are on rise. 3 things in tech 1. Tesla has a long road to launching Full Self-Driving in Europe. The company has teased a rollout of its driver-assist software for nearly a year. But it faces what Elon Musk has called a "layer cake of bureaucracy": European regulators are moving more slowly and have more testing requirements than their US counterparts.2 2. Cold brews, cryochambers, and baths with Paris Hilton. Carter Reum, who co-founded the VC firm M13 with his brother Courtney, is a big fan of intermittent fasting and cooking simple meals. He walked BI through his daily routine, which always ends by taking a bath with Paris Hilton, his wife, for our Power Hours series. 3. The battle of the LLMs. LMArena, a popular website where enthusiasts can evaluate AI models, recently blew up when Nano Banana went viral for churning out impressive images and photo edits. Now, LMArena has over 3 million monthly, according to CTO Wei-Lin Chiang. BI chatted with Chiang about the top AI models people are using, and more. 3 things in business 1. Welcome to real estate's year of cold feet. Homebuyers are backing out of deals just before the finish line at a record rate. Buyers are growing skittish about the rising costs of home ownership, mortgage rates, and the job market. With more houses available and fewer buyers to compete with, current home buyers can afford to be picky — but that leverage won't last forever. 2. MrBeast's new venture: telecommunications. The world's biggest YouTube creator is looking to start a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, per a leaked investor deck from early 2025 viewed by BI. MVNOs are a popular business strategy among celebrities like Ryan Reynolds, and the move is part of a larger push from Beast Industries to diversify MrBeast beyond media. 3. Meet Chloe Malle, Vogue's new top editor. The speculation is over: Anna Wintour has named Malle to be the head of the publication's editorial content. The 39-year-old has spent almost her entire career at Vogue, starting in 2011 as a social editor. Here's what we know about her. BlackRock shares the 3 main things it's learned from a wild first half of 2025 in markets. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York City.

September 03, 2025 09:00 ET | Source: Etherealize, Inc. Etherealize, Inc. NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Etherealize, the company developing products and infrastructure to onboard institutions to Ethereum, has announced the closing of a $40 million funding round led by Electric Capital and Paradigm. This funding is in addition to a grant received from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation in 2024 to kickstart its operations and educate the financial sector about Ethereum. With this latest raise, Etherealize is strengthening its position at the forefront of innovation on Wall Street and as the definitive builder of institutional-grade settlement and privacy infrastructure for tokenized assets. The team will continue driving institutional adoption of Ethereum by developing: "Over the past decade, Ethereum has gone from an experiment to the world's most battle-tested, open financial network. This raise kicks off the ‘Institutional Merge'—upgrading institutional finance to modern, safer, globally accessible rails," said Danny Ryan, cofounder and President of Etherealize. Etherealize's Mission The company remains focused on two priorities: educating the financial sector on Ethereum's value proposition and rewiring Wall Street with Ethereum's programmable, credibly neutral infrastructure.Co-founded by former Wall Street trader Vivek Raman, former member of Ethereum Foundation leadership and research lead Danny Ryan, and Ethereum veterans Grant Hummer and Zach Obront, Etherealize is on a mission to modernize the legacy financial system with Ethereum as its core. "After hundreds of conversations with banks and institutions, one thing is clear: the future of finance will be built on Ethereum," said Vivek Raman, CEO of Etherealize. "This funding allows us to accelerate the development of institutional-grade infrastructure that rewires Wall Street with Ethereum as its invisible backbone. We're proud to not only be a leading voice for Ethereum on Wall Street, but to also be an engineering powerhouse driving the next wave of institutional blockchain adoption." Ethereum has evolved from a programmer's vision to build the world computer into a global financial infrastructure layer powering hundreds of billions of dollars in activity. It has outpaced rivals by attracting major institutions like JPMorgan, Apollo, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity, BlackRock, and UBS. Today, the Ethereum ecosystem processes 95% of all stablecoin volume ($237.5 billion) and 82% of tokenized real-world assets ($10.5 billion), reinforcing its role as the leading platform for global finance. The Team's Accomplishments Since Etherealize's launch in January 2025, the company has made significant impact across policy, infrastructure, and market engagement, including: Etherealize has built a world-class team of Wall Street veterans such as Jeff Frase (Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, co-CEO of Noble Group), McAndrew Rudisill (Tiger, Harbor Island, ETHZilla), Jay Katz (founder of ClearPar and Storm Networks), and top-tier Ethereum and zero-knowledge cryptography engineers all on the charge to merge Wall Street and Ethereum. About Etherealize Etherealize builds Ethereum-based products and infrastructure for Wall Street, delivering compliant, private, and scalable solutions for trading, tokenization, and settlement. Founded in 2025 by Ethereum ecosystem leaders and Wall Street veterans, Etherealize is on a mission to ensure the global financial system is faster, safer, and built for the 21st century.

Posted on 09/03/2025 5:57:02 AM PDT by TigerClaws Four candidates and two reserves from the right-wing AfD political party in Germany have dropped dead within 13 days of each other — just before elections, according to reports. The Alternative for Deutschland candidates were set to appear on ballots in North Rhine-Westphalia on September 14. Officials said no foul play is currently suspected in any of their deaths, the BBC reported. Ralph Lange, 66, Wolfgang Klinger, 71, Stefan Berendes, 59, and Wolfgang Seitz, 59, all kicked the bucket within two weeks of each other, the European Conservative reported. Two reserve candidates also died over the same period. German officials stated that two of the deaths were a result of natural causes, but have not commented on the cause of the others.

Macron and the EUropean Globalists have been killing or trying to assasinate those they don’t like for several years, in addition to massive NGO monies. The US is involved in this at ground level. If the this political party comes to power over the next 8-10 years, Germany will slip from EU membership and rebuild itself; Macron is Mr. Blackrock himself - what we know of them is that they always get what they want. This is a changing of the guard - we can kill the opposition for only so long before their voter base becomes unstable.

Title: BlackRock calls out state officials for ‘politicization’ of public pensions

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. After Republican and Democrat state and local finance officials offered dueling views on fiduciary duty, the asset manager said such “politicization of pension fund management” costs retirees. BlackRock’s letter said “the politicization of pension fund management ultimately costs savers and retirees” and that most of the questions raised in the letters ultimately concern the asset manager’s approach to investment stewardship for its clients. In addition to urging BlackRock and 24 other U.S. financial institutions to stop framing climate change and other “deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks,” the Republican state finance officers sought to have the firms refrain from incorporating net-zero climate commitments, natural capital frameworks or the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive into their investment strategies. Democrat state and local finance officials sent their letter to BlackRock and 17 other firms, looking for the firms to reaffirm their commitment to managing long-term climate change, supply chain and governance-related risks. The officials urged the institutions to expand proxy voting opportunities and develop advanced capital oversight tools. “Fiduciary duty is one of our foundational principles — as an asset manager, we always put our clients and their interests first,” Moffat wrote. “We take this duty seriously and are proud to help 35 million Americans save and invest for retirement, including many who reside in your states.” Moffat said in the response letter that many of the firm’s clients “believe that shareholder participation also encourages a healthier capital market system and serves as a foundational element of America’s strong capital markets.” However, she distinguished the firm from activist investors by noting that BlackRock doesn’t file shareholder proposals or issue board nominations, or “act collectively with other shareholders or organizations” to vote shares or rely on outside proxy advisory firms. “Various federal, state, and local regulators monitor BlackRock’s compliance with standards and commitments that require us to refrain from being an activist shareholder,” BlackRock’s Aug. 27 letter said. “We have always complied with these regulations.” This spring, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission renewed BlackRock’s blanket authorization to acquire up to 20% of voting shares in some public utilities, with FERC finding arguments that the asset manager was an activist investor “unpersuasive.” BlackRock’s letter to the state officials noted that the agency upheld that finding in early August after a request for rehearing from consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen. FERC’s Aug. 6 determination ultimately affirmed its reauthorization of BlackRock’s blanket authorization and separately rejected a joint appeal from a coalition of Republican state attorneys general and conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research as untimely.

Title: BlackRock shares the 3 main things it's learned from a wild first half of 2025 in markets
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-stock-market-trading-lessons-ytd-blackrock-investment-institute-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-03T09:40:01Z

With a volatile first half of the year in the books for markets, analysts from the BlackRock Investment Institute (BII) are finally taking some time to breathe and take stock of some lessons learned. The firm cited uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff policies as a primary driver of price swings in the first half of the year — but also said the lack of sustained volatility was a surprise in and of itself. In total, the BII team arrived at three main observations from the first eight months of the year, based on how investor behavior has informed moves in the bond market and red-hot AI sector: In the first lesson, BlackRock recalls when the market was able to serve as a guardrail against Trump's most extreme tariff plan. The best example was so-called Liberation Day, when Trump announced a wide range of duties on US trade partners. Stocks plunged and treasury yields spiked. Investors made their displeasure felt, and Trump ultimately walked back some tariffs, or delayed their implementation altogether. "We recognized the global financial order couldn't rewire fast and U.S. stocks have now caught up," the analysts summarized, describing the strategy of betting on these reversals as one of the year's best plays. The BlackRock analysts used the most formidable current mega-force — AI — as their example for lesson number two. Rather than broadly flinging money at AI, investors should be more discerning and realize which areas are still ripe with opportunity, and which are fully priced. Not everything with the word "AI" in its name is going to succeed. BII says the most successful traders will constantly track developments and keep maneuvering over time. From the analysts' perspective, the market is currently in the buildout stage of the AI, the first of three phases that also includes adoption and transformation, both of which will likely take time to develop and may end up changing before they do. "This uncertainty demands adaptability to incoming information," the authors noted, citing the tech stock sell-off sparked by the release of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 AI model in January 2025 as an example. While making clear that 2025 has been a complicated year for investing so far, BII's analysts also laid out an inconvenient reality: historically reliable diversifiers like Treasury bonds are no longer as rock-steady as they once were. The analysts argue that the age of long-term US Treasurys offering a spot for resilience during equity market selloffs seems to be over. "Yield movements have broken with pre-pandemic norms as fiscal concerns have mounted, with 30-year U.S. Treasury yields rising as two-year yields fall, reinforcing our preference for shorter-term Treasurys," the report stated. Recommending that investors find new sources of resilience, the analysts highlighted gold's recent surge as a popular diversifier. In addition, they cited bitcoin and private assets as potential means of diversifying portfolios as economic uncertainty persists. Jump to

Title: Thrive Capital’s Philip Clark is promoted to partner

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. What do you want to be when you grow up? It’s a question we all heard as kids, and our answers were frequently telling. A child’s answer— whether firefighter, astronaut, or, in my case, paleontologist—said something about their instincts and their imagined future. Lots of kids dream of space and fire trucks, but Philip Clark had a distinct set of ambitions: he wanted to be a physicist and the CEO of Lockheed Martin. “Oh, I loved the [now-retired Lockheed recon aircraft] SR-71 when I was a kid,” said Clark. “I remember my parents put me in a preschool interview, and I was telling people about the aerodynamics of F-16s. I don’t know how much I really understood at the time, but I was definitely talking about it in building-block interviews with preschool and kindergarten principals. They were like: ‘So, you really want to talk about the air resistance on the angular momentum of this particular wing?’” Today, Clark may not be the CEO of Lockheed Martin (though he’s only 28, so he still has time) but he’s found another route into defense—in 2022, Clark began working on Thrive Capital’s investment in defense tech juggernaut Anduril, last valued this summer at $30.5 billion. Since joining Thrive from 8VC in 2022, Clark has also worked on the firm’s investments in OpenAI, Cursor, Wiz, Nudge, and Physical Intelligence. Now, Clark has been promoted to partner at Thrive, Fortune has exclusively learned. “There aren’t that many companies that end up mattering in world history,” he told Fortune. “I often talk about the alien test: If aliens were to come down to Earth and ask how the world works, what companies would appear in your description of the world?… The test at Thrive, for the companies we invest in, is that we need to believe they will appear on that list.” Thrive, started in 2011 by Joshua Kushner (profiled in Fortune last year), has become known for its big swings—big even among VCs, like doubling down on OpenAI in the largest private tech deal ever. “I often think about the word ‘counterfactual’ when investing,” said Clark. “There are two types of counterfactuals that are really important when I partner with someone. Test A: If this company or idea didn’t exist, would the world look the same or different? And I don’t mean it in a loosey-goosey way. If you walked down the street, would the world look physically different? Or if you go on your computer, does that computer look different? And Test B: Is this person counterfactually impactful? Could I give another really smart person this same idea, and get a similar result on this company? The answer to both these questions is that the idea needs to be counterfactually impactful, and the person needs to be counterfactually important.” Clark’s been at the center of the AI boom—jumping in to help hire at Cursor after Thrive’s investment in 2024 and working on the firm’s OpenAI deal—and he doesn’t think there’s an AI bubble. “People are way too narrow in how they think about what the impact of AI will be on the world,” he said. “There’s a lot about automating knowledge work, but we talk way too little about the fact that this is unlocking fundamentally new ways of manipulating atoms in the physical world… You can actually build fast, manufacturable, easily configurable, highly-customized, valuable hardware and physical world solutions to lots of problems.” That said, there is, of course, nuance. “Things can be simultaneously true,” said Clark. “Lots of less strong businesses can be funded as the most important companies in the world are created. I don’t think we’re in a dotcom era bubble right now, but it was true even then that the most important companies of the Internet were created—Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. That was true even as you had Pets.com and Webvan. Our job is to make sure you partner with Amazon, and as long as you do that early—’97, ‘99, 2001—that’s going to be an important and wild journey.” AI update… Anthropic announced yesterday it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation, with investors including Iconiq, Fidelity, and Lightspeed. Elsewhere, OpenAI announced plans to acquire Statsig for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal. In May, we had the exclusive on Statsig’s last funding round, which was conducted at the same valuation it was acquired for.

Title: Seán Moran: After nearly a century, has the time come for a GAA President of Ireland?

The involvement of such a high-profile Gaelic games personality as Jim Gavin in the race for the Áras underlines how infrequently the GAA has been a significant factor in the careers of past presidents. Gavin’s life as a public servant in both the armed forces and aviation sector has been combined with civic involvement. Between chairing Dublin’s North East Inner City programme implementation board and the Citizen’s Assembly on a directly elected mayor for the city, he has decent credentials for a run at elected office. How he fares in the bear pit of securing the Fianna Fáil nomination is one thing, and if successful, the circumstances of having his life forensically scrutinised will be another matter. But he has clearly prepared for this and will have detailed plans to take it on one step farther. At Oireachtas and government level, there has never been any shortage of GAA-gene pool politicians, especially in Fianna Fáil. Current Taoiseach Micheál Martin is a committed Nemo Rangers supporter. His predecessor Brian Cowen played football for Offaly. The exemplar of the connection is Jack Lynch, winner of six successive All-Ireland medals and a lifelong supporter of Gaelic games. Given the strength of that connection, the broader question of why the GAA has been so sparsely represented in the Phoenix Park comes into focus in the week of Éamon De Valera’s 50th anniversary. His assertion that hurling and rugby were the games most suited to the Irish temperament is well known and this newspaper had a role in Dev’s most famous, or notorious, statement about Gaelic games, made just two years before he became president. Speaking at the southern branch of the Blackrock Past Pupils’ Union annual dinner, held at Shannon Airport in April 1957, he regretted that hurling was no longer played in the school. There was also a lament that he had felt unable to attend a rugby match since 1913 because he didn’t “want it raised as a political matter and having rows kicked up about it but I will not deny that I am a keen listener to rugby commentaries”. An Irish Times reporter was on hand to detail the following controversial statement. “For Irishmen there is no football game that could equal rugby and if all our young men played rugby,” he said, “we would not only beat England and Wales, but France and the whole lot of them together.” It was hardly surprising that in the one county guaranteed to have a view on what football game was paramount, the then-taoiseach’s views came under scrutiny. At a meeting in Tralee on May 11th, Kerry county board squabbled over whether De Valera’s comments were or were not “worthy of discussion”. County chair FJ Sheehy said that he was afraid that “the taoiseach was letting too many statements go by the board”. James Barrett, of the well-known Tralee family, said that the taoiseach was being taken out of context and had issued a denial and clarified his original statement to the effect that “Irishmen in international rugby would have made a name for themselves but that hurling was their game”. The chair wasn’t convinced, saying that if the original report had been correct, it was “an outlandish statement”. JJ Sheehy, the 1920s All-Ireland winner and well-known republican, was reported as saying that it was “not the games they were comparing but the things for which they stood. The GAA fighting for the freedom of the country, the language, the games and everything distinctive of Irish nationalism”. In the end, the board decided against issuing a statement by 13 votes to eight. In a postscript, the editor of The Irish Times said the paper was satisfied that their reporter’s version of the original speech was correct. De Valera was still a fixture at All-Ireland finals during his presidency. He was never a member of the GAA, though. This was significant during the association’s most notorious interaction with the presidency during the very first term of office of Douglas Hyde. In November 1938, Hyde together with taoiseach De Valera, attended an Ireland-Poland soccer match at Dalymount Park. The president was also patron of the GAA and his presence at the international was a breach of the then operative ban on foreign games. The GAA could do nothing about De Valera’s attendance, as he wasn’t a member but Hyde was removed as patron of the association. [ Jim Gavin profile: Is the former Dublin GAA manager a good fit for president?Opens in new window ] It is ironic that the most successful of the movements for cultural independence that took root at the end of the 19th century, was the sporting one – the GAA – but despite its local community base, it has had limited success in providing candidates for the presidency. Perhaps the underlying exclusiveness of the association for many years – it’s little more than 50 years since the ban was abolished and even less time since the prohibitions on British security force membership and the use of GAA grounds by other sports, followed it – impacted at a broader level. It is true that a recent president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin, former Antrim player and Sigerson Cup winner with Queen’s, are very much from that background and the former president is currently grappling with the knotty challenge of integrating the women’s and men’s Gaelic games associations. But McAleese’s background was as a lawyer with political connections to Fianna Fáil when initially elected in 1997. Given that a successful presidential term can make it harder to get out of the Áras than into it, whoever wins in October might well be in office until 2039, taking it beyond the centenary of the presidency, which was originally devised in the 1937 Constitution. Has the time come for a successful candidate whose primary profile arises from Gaelic games? sean.moran@irishtimes.com Get an in-depth look at the weekend's action and the best analysis of upcoming fixtures in our weekly newsletter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘The judge told me I would die in prison’ – Irishman to share his story of being held hostage in Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block’

Bernard Phelan, in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom from Iran’s ‘Satan’s Block,’ where he was held for over 200 days. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. An innocent Irishman held hostage in ‘Satan’s Block’ in Iran for over 200 days, told an RTÉ documentary a judge informed him: “You will die in prison.” The harrowing jail term saw former tourism worker Bernard Phelan, aged in his 60s, stripped of his dignity and forced to go on hunger strike in a desperate plight for freedom. Mr Phelan went from working in tourism IT and co-owning a well known LGBTQ+ bar in Paris - to being imprisoned, wrongly accused of providing information to an enemy country. You Will Die In Prison, An Irishman’s Hostage story, airs tonight at 10.35pm on RTÉ One and unearths the mental and physical toll one innocent man withstood and his survival against the might of the Iranian regime. Born in Clonmel, Co Tipperary, Mr Phelan grew up in Blackrock, South Co Dublin. He was living in Paris, before being taken hostage in Mashhad, Iran in October 2022. “I was taken to an interrogation centre in a car, blindfolded and handcuffed and that's when the nightmare really started,” Mr Phelan told the RTÉ documentary. “As I left the room, the judge said to me, through his translation: ‘You will die in prison.’ That was a big shock.” After visiting the country as a tourist, Mr Phelan struck up a business relationship with a company offering adventure tours. And in September 2022, he visited Iran to meet the business owners. However, the dual Irish-French national was, he admits, in the “wrong place at the wrong time.” The country had just witnessed a watershed moment, an uprising for women’s rights, after the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. The young woman was arrested by the morality police for not wearing a hijab in accordance with Iranian Government protocol. She died in police custody, sparking huge protests, the likes never witnessed in Iran. As he visited the exterior of the holy Imam Reza Mosque in Mashhad, where his business partner was taking photographs, Mr Phelan was arrested and taken to an interrogation centre. He was blindfolded and handcuffed and “that’s when the nightmare really started,” he said. Mr Phelan was kept in chains and named Number 67 in Arabic. When his number was called, he had no idea if he was to be given bread or have his throat slit. He described being moved to Mashhad Prison, meant to hold 1,500 prisoners, but where he believed there may be as many as 20,000. Bernard Phelan with his late father Vincent Phelan, who never gave up on his son as he was held hostage in an Iranian prison. Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 3rd 2025 A judge warned him he may die in the jail. But determined to secure his freedom, Mr Phelan launched a campaign from his prison cell. His father Vincent Phelan hand delivered a letter to the Iranian Embassy in Dublin calling for his release. Mr Phelan befriended a political prisoner, Taj Muhammed Khormali, eventually executed on April 8, 2025. “Sometimes you heard them crying,” Mr Phelan said, of the prisoners condemned to death. “You don’t know when you’re going to die, it could be tomorrow morning or two years time,” he said. “I imagined my health would give up,” he said. “I wasn't in good health, I had high blood pressure, HIV… I take medication to avoid stroke. I take tablets for depression. My mental state was very fragile. I really had very black thoughts." He told the documentary he went on hunger strike but was forced to relent when his father begged him to stop. "Please don't do this to me, I want to see you alive,” his father wrote. “If my dad died while I was in prison, I’d have gone back on hunger strike,” Mr Phelan, who still suffers from PTSD, said. The tide only began to turn when President Michael D Higgins wrote twice to his father, promising he would do all he could to assist. The family then pressured the Irish Government via the media on its plans to open an Irish embassy in Tehran. This led to Irish-French negotiations with Iran, with Mr Phelan’s release being the linchpin to future embassy plans. “If I’d had my visa and my Irish passport, I’d not have been arrested,” Mr Phelan believes. He was finally released in May 2023 and flown back in a medical bed to Paris. His husband, Roland Bonello and family, greeted him at the airport. In October, 2024, Vincent Phelan finally got to meet President Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin, with his son. But just one week later the 98-year-old passed away. “My dad was so proud he got to see Michael D. The next day he had an accident and passed away a week later, shortly before his 99th birthday,” he said. “But he got to see the president and got letters from the president. He had a good life, an unusual end of life because of me. It was a full life.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock Holds Back on XRP as ETF Rumors Heat Up for Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has opted not to file for a U.S. spot XRP ETF in 2025 despite the SEC reclassifying XRP as a digital commodity and settling its lawsuit with Ripple. The decision comes as competitors such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares aggressively pursue XRP ETF approvals, with market analysts projecting inflows between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion by year-end. Instead, BlackRock remains focused on its dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products, citing limited institutional demand for altcoins. While the firm stresses caution, critics warn that hesitation could cost BlackRock market share as rival funds attract institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of September. Grayscale filed an updated S-1 with the SEC for its proposed Cardano ETF, boosting approval odds on prediction market Polymarket to 87%, up from 63–75%. The proposed fund would trade on NYSE Arca, holding ADA directly with Coinbase Custody providing security. Analysts believe an approval could propel ADA’s price well above $1.00, with potential gains of 40–55% if institutional inflows materialize. Beyond ETF speculation, Cardano continues to build fundamentals with ecosystem upgrades such as smart contract enhancements and the Midnight privacy protocol. Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) have also captured investor attention amid ETF buzz and ecosystem progress. DOT, trading around $3.76, has been resilient, with analysts forecasting steady growth toward $4.20 this year and $6.99–$8.45 in 2026 as adoption of its cross-chain technology expands. Chainlink, on the other hand, surged past $23 in late August after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would publish official economic data on-chain using Chainlink’s oracle network. Bitwise also filed for a Chainlink spot ETF, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts see potential for LINK to retest highs near $30 if momentum holds. With ETF speculation filling the market, BlackRock’s conservative stance on XRP contrasts sharply with the aggressive push by rivals into Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink. As SEC decisions approach this fall, the outcome could redefine institutional participation in the broader crypto market.

The index tracks the seven largest US technology companies, Coinbase's own stock, and BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase will launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure, according to a Sept. 2 announcement. The product will debut on Sept. 22, arriving less than two months after Coinbase began offering CFTC-regulated perpetuals to US customers in July. The hybrid index tracks 10 equally weighted components: the seven largest US technology companies, known as the “Magnificent Seven,” Coinbase’s own stock, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Each component represents 10% of the index, with quarterly rebalancing to maintain equal weightings. The Magnificent Seven stocks include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and Tesla. The cryptocurrency exposure is provided through the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), offering indirect access to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. Coinbase positions the product as addressing investor demand for dual exposure to traditional financial instruments and digital assets. The company stated that no US-listed derivative previously offered access to both equities and cryptocurrencies within a futures product. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via The monthly cash-settled contracts represent $1 multiplied by the index value. At an example index price of $3,000, each contract would carry a notional value of $3,000. MarketVector serves as the official index provider for calculation and maintenance. The launch builds on Coinbase’s derivatives expansion following its July introduction of CFTC-regulated perpetual contracts for US customers. Those products offer up to 10x leverage with 0.02% fees on major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Coinbase frames the equity index futures as marking “the next evolution of our product suite” and paving the way for multi-asset derivatives that broaden access and efficiency for investors. The company promises to expand availability to retail users in the coming months after the initial launch through partner platforms.

Alphabet shares popped 6% in extended trading. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice, including selling off its Chrome browser, which provides data that helps its advertising business deliver targeted ads. “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment,” the decision states. “Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.” (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: The Problem Is Solved by Art, Not Science

Time Published: 2025-09-02T20:00:00Z

Editor Solutions Brownstone Institute, Jeffrey A. Tucker So much of what is considered science today is really just art. It’s a subjective interpretation of the meaning of data. Data does not speak for itself. It does not tell you cause and effect. It provides no predictive map for the future. It’s often incorrect or merely a proximate rendering of the full reality. Even the best and most experienced experts and invested stakeholders cannot overcome this problem. The implications of this insight are vast. Let’s start with an easy example. Did you see Gladiator II? It had many of the same actors as the first movie that swept the awards and captivated audiences worldwide. It had bloody fight scenes. It had great music. It had creepy relationships, wicked power plays, feats of derring-do, displays of all kinds of cruelty and heroics, plus CGI of a recreated Roman Colosseum, this time with the floor flooded with water for a sea battle. And yet the movie left audiences with not much. The experience was overall evaporative and the message elusive. The magic was missing. That special story arc of drama that swept us up in the first was strangely absent. At some point halfway through – and speaking as someone who loved the first – it struck me that I could walk away and not really care how it ended. This often happens with sequels. It’s not just because the directors and producers see an easy buck by roping in audiences to throw down for tickets, hoping to relive the experience of the first. Sequels are often a pale copy of the first because the producers, scriptwriters, and directors are themselves not entirely sure why the first one was great. The movie makers can workshop this all day and for weeks. They can gather focus groups. They can talk to experts. They can pay the actors the big bucks. Everyone will have a theory, and they can try to recreate and reboot the thing as best they can. But at some point, no matter how hard they try and with many millions on the line, they leave the magical creative world of art and enter into the mundane task of recreation. With all their efforts, the drama is drained away. No one knows for sure when or how that happens. This example comes to mind in the midst of the continued meltdown over the logo change at Cracker Barrel. It seems obvious in retrospect that eliminating Uncle Herschel (a real person who was the uncle of the founder) and the barrel was a bad idea. It comes at a time of rising nostalgia and deep public suspicion of major corporations and their perceived attack on basic values. Maybe it is not entirely clear why this one logo change would have ignited populist fury in normal times but when you consider the loss of trust in everything, this struck people as deeply offensive. We learn from deeper reports on the decision that it was not arbitrary. The new CEO Julie Felss Masino, hired in 2023, was tasked with bringing back customers and the stock price after it was slammed during Covid lockdowns. That’s a huge challenge for anyone, especially given the roaring inflation that followed the money printing of the period. Julie reached into her communications undergraduate degree and her Master’s of Business Administration and found a possible answer. The goal is to attract a younger generation. She had heard from her social set many times that the union of the word “cracker” with a white guy in overalls has racist overtones. Maybe it refers to cracking the whip. Maybe it is a signal that only whites are allowed. Maybe the overalls suggest it is only for farmers or aging nostalgists. In any case, it seemed obvious to her that an update was in order. Further, the executive team brought in focus groups. They did customer surveys. They assembled all the empirical evidence they could find. In the end, they discerned that they would win more with a change than they would lose from those who would miss the old sign. This intuition was further backed by a plan for interior changes. Down with all the bric-a-brac on the walls and up with a cleaner look of an Apple store. After all, this is where interior design seems to be headed. Shouldn’t Cracker Barrel keep up? And yet, once the announcement was made, the customers and the public were invited to respond. What they saw was one of the few franchises with symbolism that drew on cultural memory and its replacement by the soulless, barren, and deracinated symbolism that has defined so much of what everyone hates about public life today. It suggested that yet another huge corporation was trampling on history, tradition, and meaning. Consumers these days are interested in testing their power in ways akin to voters. They will buy or decline to buy as a way of rewarding or punishing companies that make decisions that affect the aesthetics of public life. We’ve seen this with Jaguar, Bud Light, Target, and many other companies that have run afoul of the emerging public mood that trends toward a kind of restoration. To reward or decline to do so is the very essence of the capitalist experience. It is a manner of taking back power for the people. Companies make mistakes all the time. That’s because marketing is not science. It is art, an extension of human judgment, just like making movies or writing songs. We can flatter ourselves that the answer is always in the data. They can do surveys and focus groups. But often all those techniques can lead managers astray to the point that they land far afield of what could be called common sense. If anyone from Cracker Barrel’s management had entered a restaurant and shown the two images side by side to an average customer, they could have anticipated the uproar. The problem is that ideology is blinding toward reality that any average person can see. The same is true of high-end credentials and impressive resumes. They confer not wisdom but exaggerated confidence in subjective judgment. The career of the new CEO took her from Sprinkles Cupcake to Starbucks to Taco Bell. Surely she has the requisite experience. But what if that experience consisted of working within a tight bubble of influence of people from her social and professional class? After all, she kept trading up in her career and now pulls in $6.8 million a year – not exactly in keeping with the medium family income of the typical customer of Cracker Barrel. The point is that her class and social bubble affected her judgment, as well as those around her. All the data, surveys, and focus groups did not dislodge her prevailing theory that modernization was the key to return to profitability. The test happened in real life: the decision was a calamity. Maybe it pleased BlackRock, which is the largest single stockholder. Maybe it pleased her social set. She was certainly pleased with the decision. But the general public flew into fury. Management and marketing in graduate school is often rendered as empirical sciences. That’s ridiculous but such is the bias of our age. Everyone thinks there is some system, some mechanism, some machine, some data set, that will point the right way. This applies in every area, including infectious disease, pharmacology, government, and thousands of other fields. The belief that the data speaks for itself is the religion of our time. The trouble is that it does not. We are just as controlled by value systems and subjective judgment as were men in the ancient world. All our techniques have changed nothing about this. This week, for example, Brownstone Institute found itself embroiled in a highly technical argument over the RSV shot for babies. An outside committee of the CDC approved it with only two no votes, one member of whom reported real doubts about the data. Sure enough, Brownstone reported the problems, which are highly technical. Then it got worse as more data scientists weighed in. Now there is a genuine question about whether the committee was presented with truthful data. The larger issue is that the manufacturer wanted the shot approved and so did the CDC. The study and data and appearance of science was secondary, a mere veneer to a larger agenda that was driven by a value proposition. They wanted the shot out there. The science was just the excuse. But then it fell apart or, at least, did not hold up to the promise. Now we find ourselves again in the awkward position of having trusted the experts and discovering that this was not a good idea. One of the great books of our age is Tom Harrington’s The Treason of the Experts. He writes from the point of view of the humanities, explaining many of the above points. He explains that everyone is working hard to find the science of what is really an art. This point applies to the healing arts as well. Why did anyone think that locking down society would be good for health? It’s nuts and anyone could have known that, unless the person had a head full of models and maths. The fake science literally blinded the entire world. What’s happened to many brands and to many countries traces to the adoption of a superstition with a scientific veneer. Fortunately, the people have some limited means of making a correction, smacking the fake experts around a bit, and resetting the world to operate in a way that is more humane and intuitively truthful. This could be the next stage of history. With the experts and the science having led us to a place of disaster, the principles, arts, and ethics of old can lead us back to a better place.
