Share this article BlackRock’s BUIDL fund has gained $600 million in assets under management over the past two weeks on Ethereum, according to Token Terminal, a crypto analytics firm tracking on-chain metrics for tokenized assets. The BUIDL fund is BlackRock’s tokenized USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The world’s largest asset manager has distributed over $78 million in dividends through the fund since launch and now issues it natively on seven leading blockchains. Ethereum holds the majority of BUIDL’s assets under management. BlackRock actively expanded its tokenized fund offerings across multiple blockchains, including Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana. Securitize serves as the issuer, placement agent, and transfer agent for the BUIDL fund. The tokenization platform integrated with Ripple’s stablecoin in September 2025 to enhance liquidity for yield-bearing assets. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Δ “Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Vlad Tenev told a panel at a cryptocurrency conference in Singapore on Wednesday (Oct. 1). “I think most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” said Tenev, whose comments were reported by CNBC. The CEO added that reaching 100% could take more than a decade. As that report notes, a tokenized asset is a digital representation of a real-world asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities, that can be recorded and traded on a blockchain. Robinhood in June began offering more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union, bringing the company’s stock to what was then a record high. “I think it will become the default way to get exposure to U.S. stocks outside the U.S.,” Tenev said, adding that he expects the practice to expand after there is more clarity around licensing and regulations throughout the world. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue “I think that will come, starting in Europe, but then expanding to the rest of the world,” he said. Beyond Robinhood’s launch of tokenized stocks, the CNBC report points out that there have been other indications of tokenization’s growing popularity, with financial sector titans Morgan Stanley and BlackRock expressing interest. “I actually think cryptocurrency and traditional finance have been living in two separate worlds for a while, but they’re going to fully merge,” Tenev said at the event. Tenev is not alone in forecasting the transformative effect of tokenization. As covered here last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. “A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks,” PYMNTS wrote. “The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission.” The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has emphasized the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to make sure tokenization scales responsibly. “Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments,” that report concluded.

Title: Humphreys campaign trail: ‘Wee selfies’, spirit of Big Tom and Fianna Fáil voters

In Blackrock, Co Louth - reigning tidiest small town in Ireland, they’ll have you know - an older man snaps an errant piece of litter with his picker and shoves it into a bag. He glances down the frightfully clean path as the mobile melee that is a presidential campaign rolls into the seaside village The branded Heather Humphreys cars, bright yellow campaign jackets, the colourfully dressed candidate herself, and the not insignificant cohort of media orbiting her has roused the little village from its mid-morning slumber. A woman driving down the main street shrugs gamely at the camera crews and journalists, who stop traffic as they trail across the road after the candidate. Humphreys strides into The Village Garden cafe, a pretty coffee shop on Blackrock’s main thoroughfare, and brings the whole media kit and kaboodle with her. Spoonfuls of overnight oats and coffee cups hang in the air as the stunned patrons watch the national media overwhelm what had been, until moments ago, a peaceful coffee shop. In their surprised glee to meet her, husband and wife John and Catherine Pepper, natives of Blackrock, wrangle Humphreys for a chat. After a quick search in the depths of a handbag, a bit of paper is produced, and John insists that Humphreys sits down and signs a message to each of their children: Seán and Meábh who live locally, and Sienna who is out in Dubai. “And do one more,” he tells her, for a grandchild not yet born. “I wanted them to be the first in Blackrock and Dubai to have the president’s autograph,” John explains. Humphreys helped John, who is visually impaired, into the seat beside her along with his white cane. “It would be a terror if I collapsed beside the president,” he told her. [ On the canvass with Jim Gavin in Roscommon and Catherine Connolly in BallyfermotOpens in new window ] John, who is a lifelong Fianna Fáil supporter, assured Humphreys: “If I still had my faculties, I’d be out campaigning for you.” He explains to The Irish Times that he had canvassed for “Albert and for Charlie,” but would break the habit of a lifetime and vote for Humphreys instead of for Fianna Fáil. “And if I had my sight, I’d be campaigning for her. That’s what she means to me,” John said. Out on the prom, another Soldier of Destiny was pledging his support for Humphreys. Declan Breathnach, the former Fianna Fáil TD for Louth, has known Humphreys for years through local and national politics. They even danced together back in the day, though Breathnach says Humphreys had “two left feet”. But why would a former Fianna Fáil politician not support Jim Gavin? “I don’t know Jim Gavin, I suppose. And when you know somebody and know them on a very personal basis, I think it’s incumbent on you to say what you feel.” On Fianna Fáil’s presidential campaign in general, Breathnach says “there was a lot of dithering [that] went on within the organisation, and I’m sure that Billy Kelleher saw that as well”. Fine Gael couldn’t have crafted a canvass that suited Humphreys more. The visit to Blackrock revolved around the diligent Tidy Towns committee and, of course, the local credit union. Tidy Towns in Blackrock seems to be something akin to a local sport, or maybe a religion. [ Heather Humphreys denies Simon Harris pressured her to drop disability reformsOpens in new window ] The committee effusively thanked Humphreys for pushing for the competition to continue during Covid-19 when she was the minister responsible for community development. Blackrock manages a “voluntary” ban on election posters, which every candidate has known better than to breach. Mary Murtagh of Louth Tidy Towns together thanked Humphreys for her compliance. “It’s the cable ties,” Mary says, visibly wincing at the thought of them. Humphreys recalls how her grandmother would bring her to Blackrock on her holidays. “And we had the tea in a flask, and we had the sandwiches on the beach, weather permitting!” Someone produces a sprig of literal heather for her. “I’ve me bit of heather,” Humphreys says, as she fusses to pin it to her lapel, “heather for the Heather!” People are leaning out of passing car windows to pledge first preferences. There are “wee selfies,” everyone is citing whatever Monaghan relation they can think of (“your mother must have been good stock so!”) and the spirit of the late county and western star Big Tom is invoked more than once. “I knew him well,” Humphreys told a voter emolliently, “he was a gentle man, and a gentle giant”. As is compulsory any time Humphreys visits a town, she also goes into the local Connect Credit Union to approvingly survey it and its comparatively low rate of written-off loans. “Must be very decent people in Blackrock,” Humphreys, who used to work as a credit union manager, says. In nearby Ardee, Humphreys graciously makes impressed noises when shown around the town’s run-down, cobweb strewn castle; which the local community has been loyally trying to restore for over a decade. “It will be lovely when it’s finished,” Humphreys says, generously. She also calls into a Men’s Shed in Slane, where she tried her hand at working a circular saw. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Premium ETF Heads To Nasdaq In SEC Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-bitcoin-premium-income-etf-heads-to-nasdaq-in-sec-filing/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T13:30:04Z
Full Content:
Nasdaq has filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to list the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a product designed to generate income by selling options on bitcoin-linked holdings. The proposal was submitted on September 30, 2025, and the SEC has opened a comment period as part of its review. According to the Nasdaq filing, the Trust will hold primarily bitcoin, shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), cash, and the premiums earned from written options on IBIT or on indices that track spot bitcoin ETPs. The product is described as an actively-managed exchange-traded product that the sponsor intends to be treated as a publicly-traded partnership for US federal tax purposes. The filing also sets a minimum of 80,000 Shares required to be outstanding at commencement, and lists trading hours from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. BlackRock’s move follows a wider push by asset managers to offer income-style crypto products. Reports have disclosed that the new ETF would collect premiums by writing covered calls, a strategy meant to produce regular distributions for investors who want yield rather than pure price exposure. Analysts quoted in market coverage say the approach limits upside in strong rallies but can smooth returns when bitcoin moves sideways or down. Covered calls are straightforward in concept but not without risk. The Trust would hold IBIT and bitcoin while selling call options against those holdings to collect premiums. If the calls are exercised early, the filing says IBIT shares may be delivered out to the options clearer; certain OTC options would be cash-settled. That mix of physical holdings and options income is intended to create a yield-focused product that behaves differently from a spot ETF. Market watchers note this is not BlackRock’s first bitcoin product. Based on reports, IBIT has already become a major vehicle for US investors since its launch, reaching large asset levels quickly and helping to normalize bitcoin exposure inside regulated funds. That track record likely makes it easier for BlackRock to pitch a second, income-focused offering to both retail and institutional audiences. The next steps are procedural but important. The SEC’s notice solicits public comments and will consider whether the proposed listing satisfies Nasdaq’s Rule 5711(d) and investor-protection standards. If the SEC requires changes — for example on disclosure around OTC options or daily NAV dissemination — Nasdaq and BlackRock would have to respond before trading can begin.

Title: Robinhood CEO: Here’s when the tokenisation ‘freight train’ will shake up the $115tn stock market

About us Copy link Bringing stocks, bonds, and just about every other financial asset onchain is inevitable. At least according to Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev. “Tokenisation is like a freight train,” Tenev told a captive audience at this year’s Token2049 crypto confab in Singapore. “It’s going to eat the entire financial system.” During a fireside panel in the Marina Bay Sands convention centre, the 38-year-old entrepreneur unpacked how the $127 billion stock trading app is positioning itself to tap the burgeoning tokenisation niche. In June, Tenev announced the launch of over 200 tokenised stocks on Arbitrum, a Ethereum layer 2 network, for its users in Europe. The launch also included tokenised equity in private companies, such as Tesla and OpenAI. But when will tokenised stocks become available in the US and then globally? “Most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” Tenev said. “I think a hundred per cent? That might take a decade or more.” For years, turning traditional financial assets into cryptocurrencies has been pitched as a key upgrade to financial markets. The technology ostensibly eliminates intermediaries and streamlines back offices required for trading equities and other assets. Despite these perceived advantages, it has yet to take hold in a meaningful way. The entire tokenisation market is worth $32 billion, according to rwa.xyz. Meanwhile, the global public stock market is valued at more than $115 trillion as of 2023, according to the World Economic Forum. Still, companies — on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley — are working to close that gap. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and other stalwart asset managers are actively tapping blockchain technologies to tokenise various fund products. Elsewhere, crypto firms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Kraken are moving to offer tokenised stock trading, too. The enthusiasm comes amid key market structure legislation winding its way through the halls of the US Congress. Draft bills outline which financial agency will regulate newer asset classes, such as tokenised stocks and cryptocurrencies alike. The House Clarity Act passed in July, while the Senate version is still being debated. Ultimately, lawmakers will merge the two versions before executing a vote as early as the end of the year. Thanks to the European Union’s comprehensive crypto rulebook, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, the continent has a slight lead in terms of crypto adoption — for now. “Unfortunately, but realistically, the US will probably be somewhat behind,” Tenev said. “The US will probably be the last economy to fully tokenise. But it’s inevitable. “ Liam Kelly is DL News Berlin-based DeFi Correspondent. Got a tip? Email at liam@dlnews.com.

More Info BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is negotiating the acquisition of power utility AES in a deal that could be worth $38 billion. That would make the tie-up one of the largest in history involving a public power utility in the United States, per Reuters. Media reports on the news cited sources in the know that remained unnamed and that said the deal included AES’s substantial debt load, at $29 billion, per the Financial Times. Its market capitalization, on the other hand, was valued at $9.4 billion at the time the first reports about the talks surfaced. Later, Reuters said AES’s market cap has risen to $10.94 billion, giving the potential deal a total value of over $40 billion. The reports suggest that BlackRock’s approach is related to the strong growth in electricity demand coming from the booming IT sector thanks to artificial intelligence development and the rush to build data centers to handle AI. AES gas spent a substantial sum of money over the past few years on building low-carbon generation infrastructure, namely wind and solar installations, to supply Big Tech majors concerned about their green energy credentials. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that AES had become the subject of takeover interest from large investment firms and was studying a sale. At the time, the enterprise value of the company was calculated at some $40 billion. It has electricity supply deals with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, among others. As of July, however, the company’s stock was down 38%. As of this week, the stock is down by close to 23% over the past 12 months, but it rebounded on the news that Global Infrastructure Partners was in advanced talks for the acquisition of the company. GIP itself became part of BlacRock last year, for a price of $12.5 billion. The company currently manages some $200 billion worth of assets worldwide.

Can XRP’s recovery extend itself as RLUSD eyes $800 million? He will remain with the team in an advisory role to have more time with his family. XRP’s price slipped after the update, but it rallied soon after. Ripple Labs is set for a key leadership reshuffle by the end of the year as current CTO David Schwartz will step away from his role. However, he will join the Ripple Board of Directors. In a statement, Schwartz said he will continue to work on side projects and novel applications for the XRP Ledger. “The last few months I’ve been tinkering on the side – spinning up my own XRPL node and publishing its output data, researching other use cases for XRP (besides what Ripple is focused on), and more.” He has been with Ripple for over 13 years and is part of the founding team of the XRP Ledger. Surprisingly, Schwartz contributed to Bitcoin’s early days and was even mistaken for being Satoshi Nakamoto last year. For his part, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed his illustrious impact on the XRP community as “legend.” Source: X In another development, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, expanded by nearly $50 million after last week’s BlackRock and VanEck partnership. It has also expanded to African markets via stablecoin payment providers in the region. Overall, RLUSD’s market cap is close to hitting $800 million – Underscoring strong growth for a stablecoin that debuted last December. Meanwhile, XRP closed Tuesday’s trading session in the red, with a 1.2% price dip after Schwartz’s update. However, it soon shrugged off the loss and rallied by about 4% on Wednesday. This, after Bitcoin’s [BTC] spike on the back of the U.S government’s shutdown. Source: XRP/USDT, TradingView In fact, the altcoin has consolidated for three months on the charts. And, it could front a bullish breakout or capitulate over the next few days. Market bulls might be ready for another run too.

Title: This Working Life: ‘Patrick Kavanagh was spellbinding. He was radical. I had to get involved’

Art Agnew is a volunteer at the Patrick Kavanagh Centre and former principal of St Louis in Carrickmacross Art Agnew My father and mother were our teachers at our school in Co Louth. And my grandfather and grandmother were teachers before them. I was born in 1943 and had three older sisters and three younger sisters. I was reasonably quick at school, though my sisters were all very quick. Three sisters joined the St Louis order in Carrickmacross, one left and became a teacher. My eldest sister was a nurse. My next three sisters became teachers and my younger sister was a social worker. I was a bit young at 17 when I started my teacher training in St Pat’s in Drumcondra. I went back teaching at home in Kilcurry and in 1962 returned to Dublin and started in the Christian Brothers in Crumlin. At night we did a BA in UCD as mature students. I studied English, philosophy and economics. I loved these subjects – but my love of Kavanagh did not come from them. The thing is Kavanagh was always about. He had grown up six miles away in Inniskeen. My grandaunt Brigit had taught him. She was the Miss Moore in his semi-autobiography The Green Fool. I was teaching in Crumlin for four years. I enjoyed it – though it was challenging teaching 40 boys in one class. They ranged in ability from the very bright to those who needed help. My mother told me that if I had the opportunity to go to my Aunty Gaye in Terenure for my dinner. I used to get an hour-and-a-half lunch with the Christian Brothers and it was not too hard to get there from Crumlin. We did not finish school until 4pm then. We used to get buns on a Friday, but back then not every child was well fed, it is good they have free school meals now. I knew I was not going to spend my life teaching in Dublin. I saw a position advertised in St Louis in Carrickmacross. My sister, mother and godmother had been at school there. I got the job and I stayed until I retired in 2005. I was principal for the last seven years. I was part of the community from which the children came. Occasionally I could be dealing with pastoral care, dealing with parents – and by the time I became principal, I was familiar with many kinds of problems. The vast majority of parents were supportive, the children generally had good parents. It was very important to know the parents when the idea of special needs came in. In the past, parents were a wee bit reticent about speaking up for their kids. I remember one child who came into the office this day around 2000, with tears in her eyes. But those tears were tears of joy. “I am dyslexic,” she told me, “I knew I was not thick.” I enjoyed my work – but I won’t say I enjoyed every single day as Helen, my late wife, will confirm. I would come home and I would be exhausted. I’d sit in the armchair and not get out of it until bedtime. At those times you would have hoped you could solve a problem but you could not. The things you need are energy and patience. And a comradeship with the teaching staff, and to give people space. We had a tea-break at 10.50 – and as principal you learn not to arrive into the staff room on time. You’d give people six or seven minutes before you land in to get a cup of tea, so they could suppress their annoyances with the system. We had a strong public speaking and debating tradition in the school. We took part in debating competitions in Dublin run by university students and we got to several finals. There was one time in the Eighties when we were playing the Donegal team in basketball and we had to cross the Border. Things were a bit grim at the time. Anyway, we were stopped and were waiting for clearance. There was a female soldier and she called out that she wanted our bus searched. Who came on the bus but two young soldiers. So our head girl jokes: “You can search me.” The soldiers went scarlet, with all the girls beaming at them – and they left. We went on and we won that game. Our next game was in Cork, and then we won the All-Ireland. Helen stayed at home with our four children. With my father and mother both teaching, I thought my mother had to work too hard when I was growing up. So we survived on one salary. We did ok. I taught two of our daughters Neasa and Rosita, and they didn’t mind. Rosita was the first student in Ireland to get eight A1s in her Leaving – though she’ll kill me for bringing that up. I retired in 2005 and that meant we had time to go travelling. We went to America, twice, and all over the EU. Helen died two years ago, there is much grieving – and you have to go along with it, you have to put up with it. You have to get on with things – and having four children and 10 grandchildren is a great diversion for me. I have many photographs of Helen around the house and I include her in all my conversations. We met in the Pavilion Ballroom in Blackrock, near Dundalk, on an August Bank Holiday. It turned out she grew up five miles away from me – and at the time she lived 200 yards away from my bedsit in Dublin, and so that was that. Apart from my interest in soccer, I had a grá for poetry. I had been to a lecture Patrick Kavanagh gave in Earlsfort Terrace. He was spellbinding. He was radical. I felt it was important to get involved. In 1967, the year he died, I was teaching and doing the degree at night – but two years before that, we had called into O’Dwyers pub one night. He was there with John Jordan, James Liddy, Macdara Woods and I heard him say “the top of Parnassus is flat”. Much later I was out in Greece with Helen – and it was indeed flat. I did not go talking to him that night. He was in own company. I went to his wake on Haddington Road, but I was teaching and could not go to his funeral. I got involved with the Patrick Kavanagh Centre because my grandaunt taught him and because my mother was in the training college with his sister Celia. My sister Una has written extensively on Kavanagh. In 1998 she wrote The Mystical Imagination of Patrick Kavanagh. I’ve been active since 1980 in organising Kavanagh’s yearly weekend in late September to mark his birthday. We used to hold it in November, but the weather in Carrickmacross and Inniskeen was too poor. We held it last Sunday and there were around 70 at the graveside. People came from all over Ireland. We had a poetry workshop, the Patrick Kavanagh award and a book launch, and a panel discussion on the inevitability of art. Then after that we had a film screening of Three Irish Writers – about Kavanagh, Brendan Behan and Myles na gCopaleen. In a way it was awful to watch, they all died young enough. After that we went out to the Brew House for a story telling session and a nice beer. The Kavanagh Centre opened in 1994 in what would have been St Mary’s Church, and the cemetery is where Kavanagh’s remains rest. Monaghan County Council invested nearly €1m in refurbishing the centre – and it’s world class. The annual poetry competition has been going since the Patrick Kavanagh Society was set up in 1971. The lady who won this year was Róisín Leggett Bohan from Cork. She was good. Her poetry is like Emily Dickinson with a nip to it. When I retired, I became kitman for the under 18’s Irish soccer international team. I was in 12 European countries and Turkey. I did that until 2009. I’ve been involved with Carrick Rovers since 1968, I am on the committee and would watch the matches and that. Jack Charlton and Brian Kerr brought their Irish squads to Carrickmacross and they trained on our grounds, and Ronnie Moran also brought the Liverpool squad. I have to get out of the bed before 9am. I make porridge the night before with raisins. I add honey and a banana. I walk to the shop for the paper. I’ll have tea and toast at 11. I would go walking most days. It would depend if I had anything to do. I might call out to the Kavanagh Centre if it is busy. We have schools coming all the time when Kavanagh is on the Leaving. I used to love doing the tours, but retired from tour guiding last year. I’m also chair of the Inniskeen Development Group, though again I’m planning on retiring next month. I can get around no problem at 82. There are a few who are not as fortunate and they need visiting. You know you have to do it and you do it – and you enjoy it. I’m not spouting any wings. My mother was a great believer in putting people at ease by talking away with them. And I think I have a doctorate in trivia. When I got the teaching job in Carrickmacross, in the late Sixties, towns were encouraging people to come and live there. There were 45 serviced sites, so we applied for a bungalow and got it. And I am still there today. I can cook. I’ve always cooked. I make my lunch at home. I generally go to the butcher on a Saturday. In the winter I buy half a pound of stewing meat, a sideline chop and a pork chop and lamb liver to keep me going until Thursday, then in the fish shop I buy hake, smoked cod and mackerel to take me to Friday. Generally speaking I would go to McNallys on a Friday night and meet friends. A year and a half ago we started a ciorcal comhrá – and Irish conversation group – on Wednesday evenings in the library. There are usually between 10 to 12 of us. Tomorrow I’m getting the bus to Dublin to go to a past-pupils reunion of those boys who left in 1973. They invited me. They started in 1968 and so did I. I was happy to be invited. Many have been so supportive since Helen died. I would read a good deal at night. At the moment it’s a book on the Roman empire and Frank McNally’s Not Making Hay. He is a good armchair writer, I’m full of chuckles. I would say Spraying the Potatoes is my favourite Kavanagh poem. There is a lyrical earthiness about it. I am often asked about line: “The axle-roll of a rut-locked cart/Broke the burnt stick of noon in two.” It was never fully explained by him – but I think it was just the hint of going home for the dinner. Noon in Ireland was twenty-five past one. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Wall Street indexes closed higher Wednesday, primarily boosted by the healthcare sector following Pfizer's drug price agreement with President Trump. Investors largely overlooked weaker private payrolls data and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, demonstrating historical market resilience.

Title: Bitcoin Surges Past $116K Despite U.S. Government Shutdown: Is $120K Next?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin blasted through $116,000 with a 3% daily gain even as the U.S. government officially entered shutdown, its first since 2018. The political stalemate over health-care funding has 750,000 federal workers on furlough and could cost about $400 million per day, yet risk assets shook off early nerves. Crypto’s total market cap rose 3% to $4.09T, with Bitcoin leading and dominance climbing from 57% to 59%, a structure analysts say tends to produce more durable rallies than altcoin-led surges. Gold’s sprint to fresh records near $3,875–$3,895/oz underlined the flight-to-safety backdrop, but BTC’s two-day rebound from $112,000 suggests buyers are treating macro uncertainty as a dip-buying opportunity. Fueling the rally, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.53 billion in net inflows in September, topped by $429.9 million on Sept. 30 (BlackRock, Ark, Fidelity leading). On-chain and derivatives data indicate healthy conditions as leverage resets after the decline, funding levels normalize, and open interest remains steady, allowing BTC to resume its upward trend. Technical analysts point to a multi-week bull flag with the price now pushing against the upper boundary, mirroring patterns seen before previous impulsive moves. Seasonality also favors the market, with “Uptober” traditionally showing strong performance after a positive September close. Telegram’s Pavel Durov even revived long-term optimism, reaffirming a $1 million BTC target driven by fixed supply versus money printing, sentiment often seen during mid-cycle expansions. In the near term, Bitcoin resistance is around $117,500. A clear reclaim and daily close above this level could pave the way toward $119,300–$120,300, with a psychological target near $ 120,000. Order-book heatmaps indicate significant short liquidity between $118,000 and $119,000 (about $7 billion), which could trigger a squeeze if this level is broken. On the downside, bulls aim to defend the $114,800–$115,200 zone first, then the $112,000 pivot identified before the bounce; below that, there’s a larger liquidity pocket at $107,000–$108,000 (roughly $8 billion in long liquidations). Analysts MN van de Poppe, Ted Pillows, and Daan Crypto Trades all agree on the same strategy: hold $112,000, break above $117,500, and then let momentum push toward new highs into Q4.

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Wall Street’s main stock indexes have closed higher, with the biggest boost from the healthcare sector as investors looked past weaker-than-expected private payrolls data and uncertainty around the first day of the US Federal Government shutdown. With the Labor Department’s September jobs report expected to be postponed if the government has not reopened by Friday, investors were on Wednesday paying close attention to the ADP National Employment Report. ADP showed a decline in private payrolls of 32,000 and a downwardly revised 3,000 decline in August. These numbers were weaker than economist forecasts for growth of 50,000 in September and the prior report of a 54,000 advance in August. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters.

Elsewhere in economic data, the Institute for Supply Management showed US manufacturing edged towards recovery in September. After opening lower, all three main US indexes advanced. Among the S&P 500’s 11 major industry sectors, the biggest gainer was S&P 500 healthcare, boosted by pharmaceutical companies. The healthcare rally started in earnest on Tuesday after Pfizer and US President Donald Trump said they had cut a deal. The drug maker agreed to lower prescription drug prices in the Medicaid program - compared to its charges in other developed countries - in exchange for tariff relief. Trump said he expected more drug companies to follow suit. “Yesterday was the catalyst for healthcare,” said Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, adding that the sector was probably ripe for a rally after underperforming the rest of the market so far this year. “People have not necessarily been avoiding it, but they have not been as heavily allocated into healthcare as they have been in technology and all the AI hype,” she said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.21 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 46,441.10, the S&P 500 gained 22.74 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 6,711.20 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 95.15 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 22,755.16. The S&P 500 tech sector provided the second biggest boost for the benchmark index, with Micron rallying 8.9 per cent and the broader Philadelphia chip index adding two per cent. The sector with the biggest percentage decline during the session was materials, which ended the day down more than one per cent. The healthcare sector’s biggest gainers were Biogen, up 10.9 per cent and Thermo Fisher, up 9.4 per cent. Ms Castleton noted that equity investors appeared to be shrugging off uncertainties around the shutdown. Markets have historically been resilient during government closures. The S&P 500 rose during each of the last six shutdowns, according to a note from Deutsche Bank. During the last government closure between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, indexes were able to advance. In individual stocks, a 16.8 per cent rally in shares of AES made it the biggest gainer in the benchmark index and a strong boost for the S&P 500 utilities sector. This was after the Financial Times reported that BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners was nearing a $US38 billion ($57b) deal to acquire the utility group. While the materials sector was broadly weaker, Lithium Americas Corp US shares rallied 23.3 per cent and rival Albemarle closed up 4.2 per cent. The US Department of Energy has taken a five per cent stake in Lithium Americas and a separate five per cent stake in the company’s joint venture with General Motors. Corteva said it would separate its seed and pesticide businesses into separate publicly traded companies, sending its shares down nine per cent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.92-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 580 new highs and 99 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 2,707 stocks rose and 2,003 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 68 new lows. Volume wise, on US exchanges 19.79 billion shares changed hands compared with the 20-day moving average of 18.62 billion.

Reports of a potential acquisition helped shares of a utility company power higher, while an agricultural sciences firm faced pressure after it announced a plan to separate into two independent entities. Major U.S. equities indexes recovered from early losses to end higher on the first trading day after a federal government shutdown took effect. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow eked out a 0.1% gain to finish at all-time highs. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4% to finish just short of its closing record. Find the full market summary from Investopedia here. Shares of renewable energy provider AES (AES) surged nearly 17%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock. The push higher followed reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), is in talks to buy AES. The deal could be worth around $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever. Pharmaceutical stocks and others in the healthcare sector extended their gains Wednesday, a day after Pfizer (PFE) became the first major drugmaker to comply with a push from the White House cut medication prices in the U.S. to the lower levels seen in other countries. According to media reports, other major pharma companies could follow Pfizer's lead and seek pricing deals with the Trump administration. Shares of Biogen (BIIB), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Eli Lilly (LLY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all ranked among the benchmark index's top performers Wednesday. Shares of memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology (MU) advanced close to 9%, along with hard drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC). The moves extended recent gains on anticipation they could benefit from growing demand for data storage to support AI. Corteva (CTVA) shares tumbled 9.1%, logging the S&P 500's weakest performance Wednesday, after the agricultural sciences firm announced a plan to split its crop protection and its seed businesses into two independent companies. The company expects the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2026. Shares of tech-focused research firm Gartner (IT) fell 4.5%. Although the U.S. federal government accounts for less than 5% of Gartner's revenue, the government shutdown weighed on sentiment across the advisory industry. Gartner stock has also faced pressure stemming from concerns about how AI could disrupt the research business. Interpublic Group (IPG) stock lost 5% on Wednesday, reversing gains posted in the prior session after German biotech giant Bayer (BAYRY) named IPG as the exclusive creative and media partner for its consumer health business. IPG and fellow marketing firm Omnicom (OMC) announced that the regulatory approval process for their intended merger remains in progress and that they expect the deal to close by year-end. Omnicom shares also slipped 5%.

Title: Versant Lease at Former NY Times Building Occupies 164K SF

Time Published: 2025-10-01T18:29:24Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Versant, Comcast’s corporate cable channel spinoff, signed a lease over the summer for a temporary home across 164,545 square feet at the former New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street, according to Savills’ third-quarter Manhattan office leasing report. The move, which occurred in August, marked a major milestone for MSNBC, which moved out of its headquarters and studios at NBC’s iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Adweek cited a memo to the company’s staff from Jeff Mayzurk, Versant’s president of operations and technology, saying that the new location, known internally at Versant as “summer camp,” was chosen “due to its studio and production space and its central location.” Despite this, Versant considers the move temporary, and is reportedly still searching for a permanent location. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unclear, as was the reason the new location will only be temporary. When the Martha Graham Dance Company moved to neighboring 1501 Broadway in May of this year, Crain’s New York Business reported that asking rents in that building started at $58 per square foot. It is unclear who the brokers were for the Versant lease, although JLL is the building’s leasing team, according to the building’s website. The owner of the building’s office portion is Columbia Property Trust. The building’s first four floors and two below-grade ones are retail-oriented and separately owned, having been purchased in August 2025 by Forum at Times Square for just $28 million, according to Crain’s New York Business. Ironically, an adviser on that deal, Jay Miller of BayBridge Real Estate Capital, told Crain’s at the time that the location’s appeal was enhanced by the possibility of a proposed casino right across the street. Those hopes were dashed two weeks ago, as CO previously reported. The building – which occupies 682,843 square feet, according to Property Shark – served as the home of The New York Times from 1913 to 2007. It received a landmark designation in 2001, and underwent an extensive renovation around 2011. CO reported in 2022 that BuzzFeed, seeking to cut its office footprint, relocated to 107,000 square feet in the building that it planned to share with its new parent company, Complex Networks. Both companies have since relocated again, with Buzzfeed shrinking its footprint further to 42,210 square feet at 50 West 23rd Street. Columbia Property Trust, Versant Media and JLL did not immediately respond to requests for information. Larry Getlen can be reached at lgetlen@commercialobserver.com.

Title: This Utility Stock Is Soaring on a Takeover Report. Why It Could Be an AI Play

AES (AES) shares jumped nearly 17% Wednesday following a report the renewable energy provider is in talks to be acquired by BlackRock’s (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The Financial Times said the purchase could be worth $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever, and could be announced within days. The report noted that AES is strapped with $29 billion in debt, which would be part of the deal, and that while talks are in the advanced stage, the two sides may not come to a final agreement. AES, which has been exploring a sale among other options, also counts several big tech giants among its clients, with deals to power artificial intelligence data centers for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). The deal would underscore how some renewable energy providers have seen growing interest in recent months as investors bet on demand for power to support AI and cryptocurrency mining. A spokesperson for AES told Investopedia that per company policy, it does not respond to rumors in the marketplace. GIP did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. BlackRock acquired GIP last year for $3 billion in cash and 12 million BlackRock shares, for a total of about $12.5 billion. Before that closed last October, GIP struck a $6.2 billion partnership deal to take Minnesota-based energy company Allete private. With Wednesday's gains, shares of AES have added roughly a fifth of their value this year. BlackRock shares lost 2% Wednesday, but have climbed over 11% in 2025 so far.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy BlackRock has expanded its New York City headquarters to more than 1.2 million square feet. The asset management company has subleased an additional 193,573 square feet at Related Companies’ 50 Hudson Yards, according to a third-quarter office report from Savills. The sublandlord was Meta, which announced it was looking to cut about 250,000 square feet from its 1.2 million-square-foot office footprint at the Hudson Yards tower in December 2022. The expansion comes after BlackRock added more than 50,000 square feet to its headquarters at 50 Hudson Yards in July 2024, which brought its total footprint at the property to roughly 1.05 million square feet, as Commercial Observer previously reported. Now, following the latest expansion, BlackRock will boast roughly 1.24 million square feet of office space across more than 15 floors at the 77-story tower. The terms of the deal were unclear, but when 50 Hudson Yards opened in 2022, asking rents ranged between $175 and $240 per square foot. During the second quarter of this year, office rents in Hudson Yards averaged $153.52 per square foot, according to a report from Avison Young. JLL‘s Peter Riguardi, Matthew Astrachan, Joseph Messina and Hannah Bernstein brokered the deal. BlackRock declined to comment, while spokespeople for Related and JLL — which has represented BlackRock in past deals — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock signed its original lease at 50 Hudson Yards in 2016 for 20 years, with an initial commitment to occupy 850,000 square feet at the property, as CO previously reported. The asset management company has now far exceeded that commitment, joining the ranks of several high-profile tenants at the 2.9 million-square-foot office building. Those tenants include Meta, which leases space across 19 floors of the tower, and Truist Financial, which signed a deal for 100,000 square feet at the property in September 2022.

If you're new here, please click here to get my FREE 57-page investment banking recruiting guide - plus, get weekly updates so that you can break into investment banking. Thanks for visiting! If you’ve searched online for asset management interview questions, you’ve probably walked away disappointed. Yes, there are bits and pieces of information, but most “lists” are quite generic and gloss over detailed questions. Asset management interviews are like the “Generalist Olympics” because you need to know about a huge range of topics: The standard fit/behavioral questions, the firm’s investment strategies, economics and trade policy, valuation, equities and fixed income, general market knowledge, portfolio management, and more. The good news is that you don’t necessarily need to know a lot about each topic. The bad news is that it’s challenging to prepare because there’s no centralized place to learn about everything, and it’s much harder to “memorize” answers: One quick note before we begin: “Asset management” in this context refers to front-office work at firms such as Fidelity, Wellington, T. Rowe Price, and PIMCO. This means that you’ll analyze companies and entire sectors and construct portfolios for clients. “Asset management” does NOT mean wealth management, hedge funds, asset/liability management, or the commercial real estate kind of asset management (i.e., managing existing properties that your firm has acquired). Your clients could be either institutions or very-high-net-worth (VHNW) / ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals. But they should not be retail investors with small amounts to invest because that’s more like wealth management. Asset management firms want candidates with great academic qualifications (university name, GPA, etc.), solid internship experience in related fields (equity research, hedge funds, etc.), and the ability to work in a team and generate new investment ideas while managing risk. But there are very few entry-level openings each year (perhaps in the low hundreds or less), and the process is unstructured. You’ll go through the usual HireVue and phone/video interviews and then complete in-person final rounds, but there’s less of a strict timeline than in fields like investment banking. This means you need to prepare far in advance, as you won’t know the exact timing of each step in the process. The following topics are most important in AM interviews: Q: Tell me about yourself / walk me through your resume. A: See our guide and examples for the “Walk me through your resume” question and the article on how to walk through your resume in buy-side interviews. To give this more of an AM spin, talk about classes, student clubs, internships that are related to the markets and investing, and how working at this firm will let you focus on a certain strategy, sector, or geography you like. Focusing on team activities also helps. Q: Why asset management? A: You’ve always liked getting a big-picture view of the market and constructing entire portfolios based on individual companies and asset classes. You also like explaining your findings and rationale and understanding clients’ concerns, so AM is perfect since it combines client work and investment analysis. Avoid day trading references; focus on using classes, books, student clubs/activities, and relevant internships to explain your interest. Q: Why our firm/group? A: As always, you need to research the group beforehand, find a few “fact sheets” about their offerings, and link these into your answer (examples for T. Rowe Price): “I’m interested in your Dividend Growth Fund because it’s the perfect mix of ‘value’ and ‘growth’ investing. I focused on value in my previous hedge fund internships, but it doesn’t perform well in all market environments; this strategy is more robust and lets us shift the portfolio in changing markets and apply traditional value screens to high-growth companies.” Q: What are your strengths and weaknesses? A: There’s a full guide to this one. For strengths, you can cite points such as technical/analytical skills, communication ability, teamwork, and the ability to make quick decisions in response to market events. For weaknesses, you can discuss points like hesitating to give harsh feedback to teammates, sometimes not pushing back on inappropriate requests, or presenting too many options to clients. These questions test whether you can do the job: Q: How would you determine the optimal asset allocation for a client? A: You’d start by asking questions about their profile first: What their existing portfolio looks like, how much they have to invest, their liquidity requirements, their risk tolerance, any investment restrictions, and how much they need to live on (individuals) or fund their required obligations (e.g., pensions). Once you have gathered this information, you would start with the key constraints and then construct a portfolio to “bridge the gap” between what they currently have and what they should ideally have. For example, if a pension fund needs to make $50 million per year in employee benefit payments, you’d recommend a mix of bonds and dividend-paying stocks that would yield annual payments comfortably above that amount. After that, you would then assess the fund’s tolerated drawdowns and allocate more to bonds or stocks depending on whether it should accept more or less risk. Alternative assets, such as real estate and private equity/hedge funds, might also be allowed, but it depends on the client type. Q: Suppose that you are building a portfolio with allocations to many different asset classes. How would it be different if you were working at a pension fund vs. a university endowment? A: Both are subject to specific liquidity requirements and may have restrictions on their allowed strategies, securities, etc. The key difference is that endowments often plan longer-term and have a higher risk tolerance because they don’t need to make specific annual payments to retired employees; they simply need to grow their university’s assets over many decades. So, you might lean toward a more traditional stock/bond mix for a pension fund, but would be more likely to consider alternatives (real estate, PE/HF investments, etc.) for an endowment, along with a higher allocation to riskier assets. Q: A client’s portfolio just fell by 20% in the most recent quarter, and he is very upset with your firm. What would you do to calm him down? A: First, you’d listen to his concerns and spend time asking follow-up questions about his feelings, what he expected vs. what happened, and how this affects his real life. Then, you’d try to reframe the losses in a way that speaks to their concerns and mindset. This varies by client type and outlook, but a few examples include: Q: What is your investment philosophy, and how does it match ours? A: This one varies by candidate and fund, but here’s an example answer: “I understand that your fund focuses on ‘value with a macro overlay,’ so you invest in ~80% value stocks and then use other securities, such as precious metals ETFs, to hedge macro risk. I focused on value investing in emerging markets in my last role, which is quite similar because macro factors make an outsized impact there. Issues like a country’s borrowings in local currency vs. USD, its current account surplus/deficit, and commodity prices make a huge impact because many EM companies – even ‘value’ ones – are tied to exports and commodity prices. So, with every single investment recommendation I made, I always had to think about how to hedge the macro risk via derivatives and other investments.” Q: How do you manage risk in your portfolios? A: Entire books have been written about this topic, but one simple approach is to outline the key risk categories, such as currencies, interest rates, market, liquidity, and credit, and assign a “rating” for each one to each holding in your portfolio. You could then take a weighted average of these, see what the totals look like in each category, and rebalance accordingly. For example, maybe one client portfolio is overly exposed to interest-rate risk because of its allocation to long-term government bonds, but could afford to take more market risk; you might reallocate from bonds to stocks to get a more appropriate allocation. These questions are closer to the ones in investment banking interviews. But the interviewers will not go into nearly as much depth since accounting and valuation are just two of many possible topics: Q: Explain how the 3 financial statements link together. A: This is a classic question that is answered in the IB interview question article in Category #4. In short, the Net Income at the bottom of the Income Statement acts as the first line of the Cash Flow Statement. Adjust this for non-cash income and expenses, reflect the Change in Working Capital, and then record cash inflows and outflows from investing and financing activities. Cash at the bottom of the CFS equals the Beginning Cash in the period plus all these changes (Cash Flow from Operations, Investing, and Financing), and this becomes the ending Cash number on the Balance Sheet. Link the non-cash adjustments to their corresponding BS line items, make Net Income flow into Equity, and link the CFI and CFF line items to their corresponding Balance Sheet lines. Q: Walk me through how to move from EBITDA to FCF and explain how FCF is used in valuations. A: We have a whole tutorial on EBITDA to FCF, so see that for the details. In short, FCF = EBITDA – Net Interest Expense – Taxes +/- Other Non-Cash Adjustments +/- Change in Working Capital – CapEx. The tricky part is that this specific “type” of FCF is rarely used in valuations because it’s more of a credit or financial statement analysis metric. You tend to use Unlevered Free Cash Flow in a DCF because it ignores capital structure; UFCF excludes the Net Interest Expense and bases the Taxes on EBIT rather than Pre-Tax Income. Q: Explain the relationship between valuation multiples and a DCF model, and when you might rely more on one or the other. A: Unsurprisingly, we have another tutorial on valuation multiples. Essentially, they’re a “condensed” form of the DCF that expresses similar information (cash flow, future growth rates, and risk) but in a single number rather than an entire analysis. Common examples are Enterprise Value / Revenue, Enterprise Value / EBITDA, and P / E or Equity Value / Net Income. Valuation multiples are normally supporting tools in a full company analysis; they are shorter and easier than detailed projections, but also less meaningful. However, if a DCF is not feasible because the company is too speculative, does not yet generate revenue, or has other major issues, you might rely more on multiples. Q: Explain the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and how it affects valuations. A: See our tutorial on the WACC formula. This CAPM model says that a company’s Equity, Debt, and Preferred Stock have “expected” or “required” rates of return, and you can estimate the overall Discount Rate by taking a weighted average of these rates. You then use this Discount Rate in a DCF model to value the company based on its future cash flows. When the required rate of return is higher, the company’s implied value is lower (and vice versa). Q: Why does a DCF for individual companies matter if your job is to construct portfolios of 50 – 100 assets for clients? A: Single-company DCFs matter less in this context, but they can still be helpful for “sanity checking” the valuations in different sectors. For example, if Big Tech is overvalued, DCF models for all companies in the sector will probably point to similar results. So, you can often run quick analyses that give you a rough idea of valuation levels based on representative companies in the sector. And yes, you could use simple EBITDA or P / E multiples as well, but the DCF often gives you a more accurate reading (if executed correctly). In nearly all AM interviews, the interviewer will ask you about metrics such as the S&P 500 closing price and the 10-year government bond yield to assess how closely you follow the markets. However, they will also expect you to have a view on where the markets are headed. To stay up to date, it helps to read the weekly “Market Commentary” updates from various banks and AM firms: BlackRock | T. Rowe Price | Barclays | JPM | Citi Q: What’s the S&P 500 at? What about the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the prices of oil and gold? A: You can view all of these on the homepage of the WSJ each day, even without a subscription. If you’re in Europe or Asia, substitute in the major indices in your market, such as the FTSE 100 or the Nikkei and Shanghai Composite. Q: Where are the equity markets headed? Why? A: There is no “best” or universal answer for this one, and also no way to judge whether your answer is correct. But “better” answers tend to have more data supporting them, while “worse” answers are based on vibes rather than numbers: “I expect the overall U.S. market, represented by the S&P 500, to remain stagnant over the next year (vs. a ~14% YTD increase) because the companies with the largest weightings in it are valued very richly, and once some of the AI hype moderates, their share prices may not perform as well. It’s already at a 24x forward P/E vs. 25- and 10-year averages of 20x. Political instability, such as the government shutdown, and the inability to rein in the deficit will also weigh down stock prices. International markets, which are up roughly ~25% YTD based on VTIAX, should continue to outperform over the next year, perhaps in the 10 – 20% range, due to the falling USD and much lower P/E multiples in the ~15x range. Several non-U.S. developed markets have also hinted at fiscal stimulus, which could boost asset prices as well.” Q: Which sectors will benefit the most and be hurt the most by rising inflation? A: The most vulnerable sectors are ones with low margins that cannot easily pass on price increases to their customers – something like low-cost retailers might count (yes, they can increase prices, but their customers are very price-sensitive). Anything that is more defensive, viewed as a “necessity,” or has prices that are locked to inflation in some way, will tend to do better. Examples might include certain healthcare or utilities companies or consumer staples. In this category, bond questions are much more likely than currency and commodity questions: Q: Explain the yield to maturity (YTM) and duration of a bond and how you use them in portfolio management. A: The Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the annualized return an investor will receive if they buy a bond at its current market price and hold it until maturity, assuming the company makes all the required payments, and the investor reinvests the interest payments at the same rate as the overall return. Duration is the first derivative of the bond’s price with respect to the YTM, so it tells you how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest rates or “prevailing yields on similar bonds.” Portfolio managers use the YTM to measure their potential annualized returns and duration to manage interest-rate risk; they want the weighted-average duration of their entire bond portfolio to be in a certain range so that they’re not caught flat-footed if interest rates suddenly change. Q: Is a U.S. Treasury truly “risk-free?” If not, what are the risks, and how could you hedge against them? A: No. It’s free of default risk, but it still has interest-rate, currency, and inflation risk. For example, if overall interest rates increase, pushing up the yields on similar UST, the market value of any UST you own will decrease, and you will lose money if you sell them before maturity. If you convert from another currency into USD to buy these bonds, the FX rate could change and reduce the amount you earn back upon sale or maturity. And inflation risk means that if inflation runs above the YTM of the bond, you could also lose money in real terms, even if you receive all the interest payments and earn back the nominal amount you invested. Q: Recently, the Fed cut interest rates, but rates on 30-year mortgages increased. How is that possible? Shouldn’t they always follow the benchmark rate? A: The Fed only controls short-term interest rates – but mortgages are typically priced based on longer-term benchmarks, such as 10-year Treasuries. Even if short-term interest rates fall, long-term bond yields could rise if the market prices in higher political, economic, or inflation risk, which is likely what happened here. Also, mortgages have prepayment and credit default risk, so one of these may have increased despite the rate cut. Q: Compare and contrast gold and silver as assets. A: Both gold and silver are precious metals often used in the “defensive” part of portfolios. They both act as inflation hedges and provide downside protection in market crashes, making them particularly useful when interest rates are currently low but inflation expectations are rising. However, silver tends to be more volatile than gold and fluctuates more in different economics cycles, as it also has significant industrial uses, such as in EVs and smartphones. Most investors aim to maintain a specific gold/silver ratio over time. Q: Consider the USD/EUR exchange rate. Suppose that the ECB cuts interest rates at a faster rate than the Fed, the major EU member states report falling trade surpluses with the U.S., and European GDP growth comes in below expectations. Despite all this, the EUR *rises* against the USD. Why? A: Dozens of factors influence FX rates, but a currency tends to strengthen when yields on government bonds priced in that currency increase, when the country runs a trade surplus, and when economic growth exceeds expectations. So, in this scenario, we would expect the EUR to fall against the USD since it’s the opposite in each case. The answer probably lies in other factors not mentioned here: For example, maybe on-again-off-again/confusing tariffs or geopolitical uncertainty has reduced confidence in the USD, and investors have flocked to the EUR as a safe(r) haven. Many of these questions do not have “answers” – they’re designed to spur a discussion between you and the interviewer. You could say almost anything if you back it up with solid reasoning, so the goal is to assess how deep you can go based on your knowledge. Q: How will tariffs impact the global economy? A: We published a whole article about this one back in April, so you can start there. In short, tariffs are an additional corporate tax on foreign-sourced parts, supplies, and raw materials, so they tend to be inflationary if companies pass them on 1:1 to customers (which may or may not happen – it depends on their margins and competition). Theoretically, tariffs are supposed to encourage more domestic production, but the real-life results have been mixed. So, the best answer is that tariffs are “case by case,” and they’ll boost some sectors (e.g., domestic auto companies) while hurting others (luxury retailers, spirits companies, etc.). They turn the economy into more of a “government picks the winners and losers” game. Q: How will AI and automation affect the economy? A: AI and automation tools tend to reduce labor costs, but they increase demand for the required inputs, such as electricity and rare-earth/other metals. So, like tariffs, this one is case-by-case based on the labor costs in each industry, how much AI will shift those costs, and whether the industry is a “supplier” or “consumer.” For example, mining companies could benefit greatly because AI demand could boost prices for metals like aluminum, silicon, and copper (all used in chips), as it takes a long time for production to catch up. Many “white-collar” industries, such as law firms, Big 4 accounting firms, and banks, will likely see falling labor costs as teams can do more with less (so, they may be able to maintain or expand their margins even as they grow). On the other hand, sectors like nursing facilities may not be affected much because nurses are very difficult to “replace” or even “augment” with current AI tools. Q: The demographics in most developed countries are awful, as no one is having kids anymore. How will this affect GDP growth and asset prices? A: Falling populations due to low birth rates negatively impact GDP growth because it’s much harder to grow an economy when the population is falling (of course, improved automation could change this). Also, social welfare systems such as Social Security and Medicare in the U.S. become increasingly difficult to maintain since the burden falls disproportionately on younger workers. Higher taxes to fund these systems, plus benefit cuts to keep them solvent, both translate into reduced consumer spending, which puts more downward pressure on GDP. That said, asset prices will not necessarily fall because they depend on the money supply and fiscal and monetary factors as well. So, if the government runs huge deficits and prints money to fund these social welfare systems and prop up consumer spending, asset prices could keep inflating, even if the overall economy is poor. We’ve covered stock pitches extensively, including some of the differences in long-only roles. The short version is that you should prepare at least one “Long” pitch by following the guide, but it doesn’t have to be for a specific stock. If you’re interviewing for a role that’s more “big picture,” you could also pitch an ETF focused on a specific industry, geography, or company type. Rather than doing exhaustive research and creating a detailed model, focus on quick pitches that you can explain in 30 – 60 seconds. There’s a good “investor presentation” example for Tema Global Royalties ETF here. You could use this to extract and mention these points in your pitch: Finally, case studies outside of stock pitches are not that likely unless you complete a U.K.-style assessment center. If you do, expect some type of group exercise that involves portfolio construction or selecting Fund A vs. Fund B for your portfolio. This article turned out to be far longer than I expected because the breadth of topics in these interviews is so wide. Unfortunately, I don’t think there is a quick/straightforward preparation plan. You must read a lot about the economy, markets, trade, and geopolitics, and there is no real shortcut to understanding everything. If I had to suggest a specific plan, I’d recommend spending one day on each “preparable topic” above (fit/behavioral questions, portfolio/client management, accounting/valuation, equities, FICC, and your stock pitch). You should be able to do a decent job reviewing each one and outlining answers to common questions in this time frame. Don’t spend more than a day coming up with your stock pitch; maybe even limit it to a few hours to prevent an overly complex pitch. With everything in the other categories (“General Market Knowledge” and “Economics, Trade, and Geopolitics”), the only answer is to continuously read sources like the WSJ and FT. It may be boring, but winning the “Generalist Olympics” of asset management interviews is sort of like winning the real Olympics: A ton of repetition over long periods and more than a little luck.

What would you do to calm him down? A true asset management aficionado would say the benchmark went down by 40% and we performed top quartile amongst peers with lower volatility. I thought about adding something like that that, but 40% seemed extreme, even for a pessimist like me. Also, even though it’s true that AM returns are benchmarked against indices, I’m not sure an upset client really wants to hear that (I realize some articles and advice may suggest this). I think it’s more useful to spin it as “This will be positive in the long run” rather than “This isn’t that bad vs. everyone else.” Your email address will not be published.

Title: World of Warcraft: Midnight deep dive reveals a continent-hopping questline as part of its main campaign, a cosy 'Arcantina' hub, and the release date of player housing's early access

At home in time for the holidays. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft: Midnight just received a massive deep dive on its official channels. It's mostly an assemblage of information already out there, such as the new Demon Hunter Spec, the game's new zones, the transmog updates, and the upcoming Prey feature—which as a difficulty sicko with precious few mates that have raid-accessible schedules? I'm very excited about. One of the more interesting tidbits lies in its Campaign. While Midnight's first zone will be the Eversong Woods, Blizzard's shaking things up with the way the rest of the expansion's story will play out. Once you've tied things up near Silvermoon, you'll have your choice of Harandar, Zul'Aman, or—get this—a romp throughout older zones. Arator’s Journey will see you following Arator on his journey (no shockers there), visiting locations like Hope's Chapel, the Scarlet Monastery, and culminating at Blackrock Mountain. When you've completed both zone stories and this questline, you'll be funnelled to the Voidstorm to throw down with Xal'atath's forces directly. The rest of the deep dive's info has mostly been released by Blizzard on official channels before, but there are two notable exceptions. The first of which is the Arcantina, a cross-faction social hub that aims to be a place where players can chill out—and also pick up quests from seasonal NPCs. The second is that Player Housing, the long-awaited feature that Blizzard seems to basically be nailing thus far, will officially be releasing in early access on December 2—though you'll have to pre-purchase Midnight first. We also got to find out a little more about how players will be getting decor. The answer being, "through basically everything". Crafting, achievements, vendors, events, you name it. What's more, anything that's accolade-related—such as beating a raid—will be applied retroactively to your player's account. All in all, Midnight's shaping up to be real compelling. Transmog updates, base UI improvements, opt-in difficult world content where a bad guy can ambush you at any time, and the most important endgame of all: Making a cute little house to put all your trash in. Based on what I've seen of other games, WoW's housing features are going to be a phenomenal boon to the 20-year old MMO's community.

Title: The Future of Financial Settlement Isn't Faster, It's Fundamentally Different

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The financial industry loves to talk about speed. Real-time payments. Instant settlement. Same-day ACH. But making a horse-drawn carriage go faster doesn't turn it into a car. The problem with traditional financial settlement is that it was built for a world that no longer exists. Traditional financial infrastructure is a patchwork of batch processing systems, correspondent banking relationships and siloed databases that were state-of-the-art when telex machines roamed the earth. Even today's "real-time" payment rails are largely smoke and mirrors. They’re just faster messages layered on top of the same 1970’s architecture. They still require reconciliation, suffer from counterparty risk and depend on business hours in specific time zones. This is a design problem. Consider what actually happens when a fintech promises "instant" international transfers. Behind the scenes, they're pre-funding accounts, managing float across multiple jurisdictions and hoping their reconciliation catches any discrepancies before month-end. The customer sees speed, but the company shoulders massive operational complexity and working capital requirements. Settlement friction negatively impacts every business that moves money. An e-commerce platform waiting T+2 for card settlements ties up working capital that could fund inventory. A logistics company managing international suppliers juggles dozens of banking relationships just to pay invoices. Even sophisticated enterprises with treasury management systems spend millions annually on the plumbing that moves value between entities. This isn't sustainable in a world where digital commerce happens 24/7, supply chains span continents and customers expect Amazon-like efficiency from every interaction. Why do we have same-day delivery on a weekend for packages but not financial transfers? Public blockchain infrastructure offers something that is worlds apart from traditional financial infrastructure: a shared, programmable settlement layer that operates continuously, transparently and without intermediaries. Value can move incredibly fast through a global economy built on blockchain rails. When BlackRock tokenized its BUIDL money market fund, it showed a recognition that 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement and programmable compliance create genuine operational advantages. When companies issue tokenized shares, they create a more efficient, transparent and accessible capital market infrastructure. These new financial primitives create entirely new markets. Let’s be clear that it’s not just financial services that are being revamped through better payment rails. The real unlock provided by smart contracts is that they can automate complex multi-party workflows that today require armies of back-office staff. A manufacturer can pay suppliers automatically when IoT sensors confirm delivery and quality checks. Real estate transactions can settle atomically, with payment, title transfer and regulatory filings happening simultaneously. Insurance claims can trigger instant payouts when parametric conditions are met. The point, again, is that blockchain doesn't just digitize traditional finance or provide increased speed. Different rails mean entirely new business models are possible. Every major bank is already tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Circle moves billions in USDC daily. PayPal's stablecoin runs on public blockchains. Why are any enterprises still debating whether this is "real?" They're missing the plot. While traditional companies optimize their SWIFT messages and patch their core banking systems, an entire parallel financial system has emerged. The gig economy worker in Manila doesn't know or care that her USDC payment bypassed the correspondent banking network; she cares about whether the money arrived instantly, so that she can use it immediately to pay rent, buy groceries or send some home to her family, all without fees eating away at her paycheck. The thing about infrastructure revolutions is that they don't announce themselves. In five years, "we still use ACH" will be the new "we still host our own servers in-house." It’s technically possible, unnecessarily expensive, and a clear signal you've fallen behind. The payment rails upgrade has happened. It just hasn't been evenly distributed yet.

Title: Let’s talk about ARR

Time Published: 2025-10-01T11:11:06Z

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. It’s likely safe to say—creative accounting’s been around for as long as accounting itself. In 1494, for example, mathematician and ‘father of modern accounting’ Luca Pacioli wrote of Venetian merchants willfully rendering their ledgers illegible. In the Gilded Age, inflating assets and understating liabilities was standard practice across a booming system. And who can forget the “channel stuffing” of the 2000s? And, because some things are eternal, this era naturally has its own creative accounting practices, which I published a feature on this past weekend. Right now, some of the most clear shenanigans are going on around ARR, or “annual recurring revenue.” “The problem is that so much of this is essentially vibe revenue,” one VC told me. “It’s not Google signing a data center contract. That’s real shit. Some startup that’s using your product temporarily? That’s really not revenue.” ARR was a favorite metric of VCs throughout the software-as-a-service (SaaS) era, widely accepted as a trusted proxy for a stable and growing startup. Now, founders are trying to apply ARR to the AI boom—and it doesn’t fit. These days, founders are counting pilots, one-time deals, or unactivated contracts as recurring revenue, six VCs told Fortune. The push comes from somewhere very human, from a desire to keep up with the competition. “There is all this pressure from companies like Decagon, Cursor, and Cognition that are just crushing it,” said another VC. “There’s so much pressure to be the company that went from zero to $100 million in X days.” At the center of all this is an essential truth: That we’re going to need to evolve metrics with AI, and how AI companies actually work. And in the meantime, it’s worth saying: Creative accounting has been around as long as businesses were counting, but that doesn’t mean it’s good practice. That doesn’t mean it’s safe or healthy for the system. And it doesn’t mean there won’t be consequences for some down the line. Read the whole story here.

Hans first became a VC in his 20s and has gone on to invest in some of the most successful companies of our time: household names like Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, and Peloton, among others.

More Info Global investment firm KKR has acquired a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets LLC, the gas pipeline network of Abu Dhabi’s national oil company, in a move signaling growing investor confidence in infrastructure opportunities in the oil and gas-rich Middle East. The new investment, the value of which was not disclosed, strengthens KKR’s long-term strategic partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and reflects the firm’s confidence in Abu Dhabi’s competitiveness as a premier global investment destination, the private equity giant said on Wednesday. The gas pipeline network connects ADNOC’s upstream assets to local off-takers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pipeline ownership and operational management remain with ADNOC. The deal for a minority stake in ADNOC’s gas pipelines assets follows the first such transaction in the Middle East, when KKR bought in 2019 a minority stake in ADNOC’s oil pipelines business. The 2019 acquisition of 40% in ADNOC Oil Pipelines by KKR and BlackRock was the first-ever investment of foreign asset managers in infrastructure of a state-owned energy firm in the Gulf. Last year, KKR and BlackRock sold the 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines LLC to Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment manager Lunate. Commenting on the deal for ADNOC’s gas pipeline infrastructure, General David Petraeus, chairman of KKR Middle East, said today that “This investment reflects KKR’s commitment to expand partnerships and investment across the Middle East. The region’s strong fundamentals, bold vision, and focused leadership offer increasingly attractive opportunities for global investors.” Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is a key part of Aramco’s plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand.

Title: Dual Share Classes Are Coming Soon. Now, What?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/regulation-legislation/dual-share-classes-are-coming-soon-now-what/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T10:10:00Z
Full Content:
ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com On your mark … get set … wait. The SEC’s pending approval of dual share classes may be the biggest story of the year for ETFs, but it may nonetheless be a while before ETF share classes of mutual funds, and vice versa, become available to investors. Following the regulator’s notice on Monday that it is set to greenlight Dimensional Fund Advisors’ request for dual share class exemptions, the company noted that it would launch share classes as soon as it is ready. That firm is certainly well ahead of most others in that regard: It already provides a range of funds in both the mutual fund and exchange-traded fund wrappers, and it has been seeking approval for several years. But even Dimensional says there is a way to go. “We know many investors are eager for the ability to exchange mutual fund shares for ETF shares without incurring transaction costs or taxes,” co-CEO Gerard O’Reilly said in an announcement, adding that custodians will need to get up to speed to facilitate the new products. F/m Investments plans to initially launch mutual fund shares of its US Treasury 3 Month Bill and Ultrashort TIPS ETFs. CEO Alex Morris said it’s a way for issuers to enter into the 401(k) market. “Expect an initial wave of approvals for mature applications, followed by a gradual rollout,” he said. Following SEC approvals, fund boards must consider whether adding share classes is appropriate for products. ETF share classes of mutual funds with capacity constraints, for example, may not be a good fit. “It’s going to be a game-changer for the industry,” said Matt Barry, head of capital markets at Touchstone Investments. “You’re going to see a lot of those [active mutual] funds offer ETF share classes … with strategies that are already at scale.” Touchstone, like most others, will likely be a year away from launching the new share classes, he said. That is in part due to the operational challenges that firms will have to address, especially if they specialize in one wrapper, but not the other. And another issue is “the ETF ecosystem’s ability to handle that number [of new] products,” Barry said, citing a potential lack of lead market makers to put up capital to support ETF share classes. Some highlights of the dual share class application race: Test Drive: “Boards have to kick the tires. The current framework contemplates substantial board oversight,” said Aisha Hunt, principal at law firm Kelley Hunt, who worked with F/m Investments on its application. There is an educational hurdle for firms in adding ETF or mutual fund shares, and companies will have to perform due diligence with RIAs and broker-dealers to see whether there is demand, she said. “You want to do it to ensure you can drive asset growth and economies of scale to benefit fund shareholders.” Semiliquid funds topped $450 billion in assets, but a handful of private credit ETFs have been slow to win over investors. ETFs that use artificial intelligence to select holdings have largely underperformed over the past five years. Many have closed. The company is reportedly considering adding third-party products to its brokerage,, but Vanguard said it hasn’t made any decisions. The ETF strategy lets wealthy investors defer, or even avoid, capital gains tax liabilities. Man Group is the latest to join the ETF bonanza, and it’s far from alone. The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. Competing theories have been proposed to explain why billions of dollars have gone into and out of several ARK ETFs in recent weeks. The Federal Reserve’s decision may not have been a surprise, but ripple effects are already being felt across the industry. Generic listing standards for crypto exchange-traded products could open the floodgates for ETPs beyond spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Top 2025 Synthetic Dollar Protocols to Earn High Yield in Crypto (Naina Rajgopalan)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/29486/top-2025-synthetic-dollar-protocols-to-earn-high-yield-in-crypto
Time Published: 2025-10-01T07:35:13Z
Full Content:
Synthetic dollars have become a practical bridge between “stablecoin-like” price stability and market-rate yields, packaging professional hedging and cash-equivalent income into assets that behave like dollars onchain. This article explains the core concepts and profiles three leading projects: Falcon Finance (USDf), Ethena (USDe), and Elixir (deUSD), with a special focus on how they balance stability, yield, collateral breadth, and operational risk to deliver competitive APY. Before moving to the overview of synthetic dollar projects, it is worth to unpack some concepts, core to understanding how these protocols work. First, what is a synthetic dollar? It is a crypto-native asset engineered to hold a $1 value, typically via overcollateralization and delta-neutral hedging of crypto collateral (or other instruments), and generate yield (the net return paid to all synthetic dollar holders), although yield is not universal or guaranteed. Synthetic dollar protocols are applications that allow to mint, stake and perform other operations with synthetic dollars, usually in an automatic manner. Most 2025 synthetic dollar designs achieve a stable yield stream by adopting certain yield-generation strategies, in particular pairing spot collateral with delta-neutral hedges, e.g., short perpetual futures, so the portfolio’s net exposure to the underlying assets is close to zero. There can be additional strategies, such as staking, cross-exchange arbitrage and DeFi liquidity provisioning. Furthermore, every synthetic dollar protocol employs a certain mechanism of collateralization and acceptance. Some protocols accept a narrow set of blue-chip cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), while others aim to accept many crypto assets and even real-world assets (RWAs). In 2025, synthetic dollar protocols also incorporate RWA rails in different forms, such as tokenized money-market funds or U.S. treasuries (T-bills), e.g., BlackRock BUIDL and Superstate USTB. Tokenized assets are used either as direct backing (treasury-backed stables) or as yield components alongside delta-neutral positions. Synthetic dollars have gained increasing popularity in 2025. According to Coingecko, the sector’s market cap more than doubled throughout the year, growing from about $6 billion to more than $16 billion by early September 2025. In one of the articles, Financial Times noted how yields compressed from the early burst of over 60% annualized to low single digits as competition crowded the basis trades, making synthetic dollar protocols a broad marketplace. At the same time, protocol design diversified: ● Some protocols added treasury-backed lines (e.g., Falcon Finance’s USTB or Ethena’s USDtb) for traditional cash management, while keeping synthetic dollars themselves (USDf, USDe, deUSD) for crypto-native yield. ● Projects like Falcon Finance offered a multi-strategy, collateral-agnostic approach aiming for steadier yields through different market regimes and a pathway to a broader collateral base (including RWAs). ● At the same time, Elixir positioned its deUSD token as “order-book infrastructure” and RWA rails, combining stETH-based hedges with sUSDS-linked treasury yields. Design and goal. The second most capitalized synthetic dollar protocol (per Coingecko), Falcon Finance manages USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic dollar, and sUSDf as the yield-bearing token. While the project offers one of the highest yield rates, its main goal is to become a universal collateralization layer: many crypto assets, along with RWA, qualify today, and more RWAs (stocks, real estate and more) are about to be added in the future. Collateral. Assets accepted by Falcon Finance as collateral for minting USDf range from major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI, USDS) to blue-chips and altcoins (BTC/WBTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, TRX, TON, AVAX, SEI, etc.), plus RWA: Superstate USTB (tokenized short-duration U.S. government securities). Yield-generation engine. Falcon distributes yield from multiple sources rather than relying only on positive funding: ● Positive and negative funding arbitrage (long spot/short perp or the converse). ● Cross-exchange price arbitrage. ● Native staking on supported non-stablecoin assets. ● Select liquidity pool deployments. Rates and traction. Emerging in early 2025, Falcon Finance has quickly risen to the top of the synthetic dollar sector: USDf total supply grew from $100 million in the end of March 2025 to over $1.6 billion in early September 2025. The main reason for popularity is one of the best APY rates, which fluctuate between 8% and 15%, but is usually above 10%. Risk management. Falcon’s risk controls combine a live Transparency page that breaks down reserves across custodians, CEX, and on-chain positions with weekly independent attestations, published for ongoing verification. Its smart contracts have been audited by Zellic and Pashov with no critical or high-severity issues identified. Operational measures include off-exchange settlement: assets are held with MPC custodians (e.g., Fireblocks and Ceffu, and trading is mirrored to top crypto exchanges to reduce counterparty exposure. Additional safeguards include an onchain insurance fund launched in August 2025 with an initial $10 million contribution, and the acceptance of Superstate’s USTB in the collateral set, introducing tokenized T-bill exposure through a regulated RWA wrapper. Design. Ethena structures USDe as a delta-neutral synthetic dollar, created by hedging crypto collateral with short perpetuals and futures to target a $1 value. Its yield-bearing asset, sUSDe, distributes net income from funding/basis spreads and collateral returns. Collateral. Ethena backs USDe with Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto assets that it can delta-hedge via perps or futures, alongside allocations to liquid stables such as USDC and USDT to support liquidity and stability. The eligible-asset mix is overseen by the Risk Committee and adjusted over time. Scale and yields. USDe is the leading synthetic dollar with a market cap of almost $13 billion by early September 2025, an important signal of institutional acceptance of the model. Its yield is generated primarily from funding and basis spreads on delta-hedged perp/futures positions and, when used in the backing, liquid-asset rewards. After an early period of elevated funding rates in 2024, Ethena’s yield saw compression toward low single-digit annualized yields as more capital competed in the basis trade. Currently, its APY ranges between 6% and 10%. Treasury-backed line. In parallel to USDe/sUSDe, Ethena supports USDtb, a stablecoin backed primarily by BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund, offering a cash-equivalent risk profile and direct mint/redeem mechanics—useful for treasurers who prefer traditional backing. Risk management. Ethena centers its controls on a public Proof-of-Reserves program that delivers weekly third-party checks of backing, coverage, and dollar-neutrality. Monthly custodian attestations further verify the existence, control, and value of reserves. Operationally, the protocol uses off-exchange settlement, so assets remain in MPC custody while hedges execute across venues. Smart contracts have undergone multiple audits, with published reports noting no critical or high-severity findings in those rounds. Design. Elixir structures deUSD as a fully collateralized, delta-neutral synthetic dollar: staked ETH (stETH/wstETH) backs the asset while an equal-notional short ETH-perpetual hedge targets a ~$1 value. A staked counterpart, sdeUSD, accrues protocol revenue to holders. deUSD’s yield comes from a blend of derivatives funding/basis and USDS/sUSDS treasury income, with the APY computed from a 7-day trailing sum of funding rewards and sUSDS rewards (net of EBF fees). Collateral. The core backing combines stETH (paired with short ETH-perps for delta neutrality) and USDS, Sky Protocol’s stablecoin. The project’s team plans to expand the basket over time. Scale and yields. As of early September 2025, public trackers show about $135 million worth of deUSD in circulation. Returns vary with perp-funding conditions and the Sky Savings Rate embedded via sUSDS. RWA rails and integrations. Elixir positions deUSD as infrastructure for tokenized securities to access DeFi: through a partnership using Securitize sTokens, holders of instruments such as BlackRock’s BUIDL can swap into sBUIDL and mint deUSD, while deUSD is accepted as yield-bearing collateral across Elixir-powered order-book venues. Risk management. Elixir publishes a dedicated Risks section (smart-contract, custody, execution, collateral, and regulatory) and implements off-exchange settlement so funds remain in on-chain MPC custody while hedges are executed across centralized venues. Smart-contract reviews include Trail of Bits, Quantstamp, and Pashov, alongside an Immunefi bug bounty. As synthetic dollars move from niche to routine portfolio tools, the choice of protocol increasingly comes down to what you hold, how you earn, and where you operate. We suggest to choose either one of the three approaches: If you prioritize breadth and steady returns in any market conditions, Falcon Finance (USDf/sUSDf) presents the golden middle. It accepts a wide spectrum of collateral, from major stablecoins and large-cap tokens to tokenized treasuries via USTB, and runs a multi-strategy engine (including funding arbitrage, staking, and liquidity deployments) that seeks competitive APY without relying solely on positive funding. It’s a natural fit for treasuries or funds with varied assets, with the usual caveat to check live yields and over-collateralization before sizing positions. If depth of liquidity and broad composability are central to your financial strategy, Ethena (USDe/sUSDe) offers scale and integrations with a well-documented mechanism. Yields are primarily funding and basis-driven, and a separate USDtb line caters to those that prefer a treasury-backed, cash-management profile, making it straightforward to match risk appetite to mandate. Where alignment with order-book venues and RWA rails matters most, Elixir (deUSD/sdeUSD) brings a funding-plus-sUSDS yield mix and exchange-centric plumbing. Current scale is smaller, so venue coverage and on-chain dashboards should guide position size, but the design suits trading-led workflows and RWA connectivity. Overall, the decision depends on collateral mix and yield preferences: Falcon for high-yield and multi-source income, Ethena for scale and funding-centric returns (with a treasury-backed option), and Elixir for exchange-aligned operations with built-in RWA pathways. Synthetic dollars matured in 2025 into a practical category that pairs dollar tracking with measurable, source-backed yield, but designs differ in collateral breadth, strategy mix, and operating scale. Falcon Finance prioritizes competitive APY, wide collateral support and multi-source returns. Ethena offers the deepest footprint with a funding-centric engine and a separate treasury-backed line. Elixir aligns tightly with exchange venues and RWA rails. Selection should follow portfolio needs: what collateral you hold, how sensitive you are to funding cycles, and where you transact, while continuously monitoring live yields, over-collateralization, and transparency disclosures.

Title: Traders Eye September Jobs Report for Cues on Bitcoin Breakout Above $120K

Crypto markets remained unchanged Monday and Tuesday after last week’s $1.5 billion liquidation flush, but traders remain cautious ahead of a critical run of U.S. economic data that could set the tone for October. Bitcoin bulls defended the $110,000 support level several times over the past week, while Ether clawed back from a sharp dip to $4,075 that coincided with nearly half a billion dollars in leveraged longs being wiped out. Total market capitalization now sits near $3.85 trillion, about 1.3% lower than a week earlier despite a 3.5% weekend rebound. The Fed’s most recent rate cut initially provided a modest boost to Bitcoin, but investors say the path forward depends less on past easing than on Powell’s Tuesday speech and upcoming jobs data that is scheduled to be released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (ET). “The crypto market is at a macroeconomic crossroads, caught between a softening labor market and resilient economic growth,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a message to CoinDesk. “This week’s data — Consumer Confidence, Initial Jobless Claims, and the pivotal September Jobs Report — will be critical in gauging the Fed’s next move. Any signs of further labor market cooling could reignite rate cut expectations, providing a tailwind for majors like BTC, ETH, and XRP. Conversely, strong data may extend the current period of uncertainty and pressure,” he said. Jobs data shows how many people are getting or losing work in the U.S. economy. If fewer people are working and unemployment rises, it suggests the economy is slowing. That usually makes the Federal Reserve more likely to cut interest rates to support growth, which can boost risk assets like stocks and crypto. But if job numbers are strong and unemployment stays low, it signals the economy is still running hot. That can keep inflation high, making the Fed less likely to cut rates. “This macro uncertainty is likely to maintain Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially capping the upside for Ethereum and the broader DeFi sector despite their superior yield opportunities,” Ruck added. Market structure reflects the indecision. A guage for sentiment fell to 28 on Friday, entering “extreme fear,” before bouncing back to a neutral 50 by Monday. Bitcoin has consolidated in a tight $108,000–$118,000 range, with open interest compressed and funding rates normalized after the liquidations. “The rebound is coming from roughly the same levels as in early September,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. “Once again, altcoins are recovering stronger than BTC. Such outperformance in the early stages of recovery often indicates the future winners of the race, which in this case are altcoins.” Kuptsikevich noted Bitcoin’s technical levels remain pivotal: “At the end of last week, Bitcoin found support at 109,000. It was bought at roughly the same levels as the end of August and even slightly higher, which is positive for the bulls.”“On the other hand, September's local high is lower than the previous one, which generally indicates a decrease in volatility and a stronger movement towards a breakout beyond the $108-118K range. Movements within the range can give many false short-term signals,” he noted. Ethereum faces its own inflection point. Analysts flagged a potential bottom, citing technical exhaustion after last week’s selloff. The token is also in focus after the launch of the first U.S. ETF with staking features, from REX Shares and Osprey Funds, with applications from BlackRock and Fidelity still under SEC review. News around Solana added to the altcoin narrative. The network’s total value locked surged to $12.2 billion, up 57% since June, prompting fresh calls for a $300 price target. Meme coins have grown more prominent as well, with sector capitalization climbing 70% over three months. Regulatory headlines, however, kept traders wary. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. regulators are probing potential insider trading tied to companies accumulating crypto reserves. Elsewhere, ratings giant Moody’s separately warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoin use in developing countries poses risks to monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

Once again, it feels as if we’re tiptoeing toward an official war between the United States and Russia — as opposed to the proxy war that has endured for three and half years between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. Although President Trump has downplayed the “rare and urgent” meeting of top military commanders from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, the event has generated intense speculation. The Pentagon says that secretary of War Hegseth merely wants to deliver a speech on the “warrior ethos” and make sure that military leaders are all walking in the same direction. The president describes the focus of the gathering in general terms: “We’re talking about what we’re doing, what they’re doing, and how we’re doing.” Still, to gather the highest-ranking members of the U.S. military in one location for a chat with the president and secretary of War leaves the impression that something of significant importance will be discussed. On Monday morning, ZeroHedge gathered data from several sites that analyze open-source intelligence to predict military engagements. Those sites were all tracking a large deployment of U.S. aerial refueling tankers crossing the Atlantic on their way to Europe. A social media account that tracks pizzerias near the Pentagon showed a spike in orders late Sunday night. The last time these sources noted a wave of air tankers leaving the United States and increased carryout orders from restaurants near the Pentagon, the U.S. military was preparing to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. When these open-source data points are viewed alongside the unusual meeting of top military commanders in northern Virginia, it is difficult not to conclude that a potentially significant military operation is imminent. Notably, there has been a shift in public messaging from high-ranking government officials. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Sunday that President Trump has authorized NATO to use U.S. missiles in direct strikes against Moscow. In a post on Truth Social one week ago, the president stated, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump’s rhetorical departure from months of effort directed toward peace came right after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City. While answering reporters’ questions at the U.N., Trump said that allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter into the airspace of NATO nations. Marveling at the president, Zelensky called Trump a “game changer.” In a separate interview on Fox News, Vice President Vance said that the administration might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Noting that President Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to equip Ukraine with weapons that can strike Moscow, Vance’s assessment of the situation nonetheless suggested that U.S.-NATO is about to take a more aggressive posture in the region. While signs indicate greater U.S. involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the near future, the Russian foreign ministry has been highlighting uncorroborated online chatter claiming that the Ukrainian military intends to use captured Russian drones in staged “false flag” attacks on logistics hubs in Poland and Romania. There are no hard facts to back this assertion, but numerous media reports coming from Hungarian sources have repeated the claim in recent days. Should Poland or Romania be attacked, President Trump’s recent comments suggest that there would be a swift U.S.-NATO response. As is always the case in war, propaganda and misdirection make it almost impossible to analyze this information. Ukraine has an obvious motive to undertake an operation against its allies in an effort to drag U.S.-led NATO into a larger war. Over the last three years, the Ukrainian military appears to have been involved in several attacks on NATO interests — including the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines supplying Russian energy to Germany and the more recent attack on pipeline networks supplying oil from Russia to Hungary and Slovakia — as part of an overall strategy to separate Russia from European Union economic partners. At the same time, it is entirely logical for Russia to flood the information space with allegations of a looming “false flag” attack while carrying out an actual attack of its own. If something were to occur in Poland, Romania, or Moldova in the next few days, both Russia and NATO will accuse the other of spreading disinformation. These competing “narratives” ensure that confusion will reign — ratcheting up the prospect of retaliatory attacks and perilous escalation. I do not like where this is heading. The issue of U.S.-NATO support for the Kyiv government in its fight against the Russian Federation has divided American conservatives. Some Americans view Russia with such hostility that they almost appear eager for a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation. I believe that such a conflict has the potential to kill millions of people and put us on the path toward long-term global instability. Those who rush to defend Ukraine’s territorial borders routinely ignore that the eastern territories in dispute belong mainly to Russian-speaking peoples who have repeatedly allied with the Russian Federation. When NATO and Kyiv deny people the natural right to determine their own future in the name of Ukraine’s national “self-determination,” I find the argument for war ludicrous. This has always been a civil war involving historically Russian areas, and bloodshed began only after Obama’s State Department and European Union emissaries decided to expand NATO’s territorial grip right up to Russia’s doorstep by sacrificing Ukraine in a proxy war. Of all the reasons that U.S. and European politicians provide for the necessity of defending Ukraine, the idea that Russia’s invasion was entirely “unprovoked” is most laughable. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Ukraine has directly attacked property belonging to NATO nations. Nonetheless, NATO appears ready to protect a country that has attacked its members and to attack a country that has not. This has always felt like another expedient “bankers’ war,” meant to put money into the hands of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions while stealing the lives and tax dollars of Western citizens. Over at The Conservative Treehouse, Sundance framed the issue aptly: The reason why the EU member states of NATO want escalated war with Russia is financial and economic. Through policy and ideology, the EU/NATO members have walked themselves into an economic dead end. They are out of assets to leverage. The only way out for the EU/NATO leadership is to create a war to erase debt, expand assets and reset the economics. While BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other World Economic Forum heavyweights divide up Ukraine’s assets and manage control over the Ukraine Recovery and Reinvestment Bank, international financial interests will turn wartime spending into a money machine. At the same time, all the self-inflicted economic damage caused by “green” energy regulations and central bank money-printing propping up the expansive European welfare state can be blamed on “Russian aggression.” Should the whole financial system near collapse, the perfect rationale will exist to implement central bank digital currencies and mandatory digital identities for Western citizens. Once again, governments will manufacture potentially catastrophic problems in order to justify “solutions” that nobody wanted in the first place. In this case, however, the problem that NATO governments are creating comes with the certain loss of numerous lives and the inherent risk of cataclysm. I don’t like this game, and I wish that wiser heads would succeed in preventing this violent calculus from reaching its ever deadlier conclusion. Right now, however, all signs point to madness. It looks as if a wider war with Russia will coincide with Antifa’s war against Americans at home. Prepare accordingly.

Once again, it feels as if we’re tiptoeing toward an official war between the United States and Russia — as opposed to the proxy war that has endured for three and half years between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. Although President Trump has downplayed the “rare and urgent” meeting of top military commanders from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, the event has generated intense speculation. The Pentagon says that secretary of War Hegseth merely wants to deliver a speech on the “warrior ethos” and make sure that military leaders are all walking in the same direction. The president describes the focus of the gathering in general terms: “We’re talking about what we’re doing, what they’re doing, and how we’re doing.” Still, to gather the highest-ranking members of the U.S. military in one location for a chat with the president and secretary of War leaves the impression that something of significant importance will be discussed. On Monday morning, ZeroHedge gathered data from several sites that analyze open-source intelligence to predict military engagements. Those sites were all tracking a large deployment of U.S. aerial refueling tankers crossing the Atlantic on their way to Europe. A social media account that tracks pizzerias near the Pentagon showed a spike in orders late Sunday night. The last time these sources noted a wave of air tankers leaving the United States and increased carryout orders from restaurants near the Pentagon, the U.S. military was preparing to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. When these open-source data points are viewed alongside the unusual meeting of top military commanders in northern Virginia, it is difficult not to conclude that a potentially significant military operation is imminent. Notably, there has been a shift in public messaging from high-ranking government officials. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Sunday that President Trump has authorized NATO to use U.S. missiles in direct strikes against Moscow. In a post on Truth Social one week ago, the president stated, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump’s rhetorical departure from months of effort directed toward peace came right after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City. While answering reporters’ questions at the U.N., Trump said that allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter into the airspace of NATO nations. Marveling at the president, Zelensky called Trump a “game changer.” In a separate interview on Fox News, Vice President Vance said that the administration might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Noting that President Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to equip Ukraine with weapons that can strike Moscow, Vance’s assessment of the situation nonetheless suggested that U.S.-NATO is about to take a more aggressive posture in the region. While signs indicate greater U.S. involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the near future, the Russian foreign ministry has been highlighting uncorroborated online chatter claiming that the Ukrainian military intends to use captured Russian drones in staged “false flag” attacks on logistics hubs in Poland and Romania. There are no hard facts to back this assertion, but numerous media reports coming from Hungarian sources have repeated the claim in recent days. Should Poland or Romania be attacked, President Trump’s recent comments suggest that there would be a swift U.S.-NATO response.
