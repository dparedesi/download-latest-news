-244.98 -66.70 + 85.00 + 1,140.00 + 15,142.00 -244.98 -66.70 -66.70 + 85.00 + 85.00 + 1,140.00 State Street’s entry into India’s mutual fund space comes amid growing global interest in the country’s asset management industry State Street Investment Management will make a strategic minority investment in Groww Asset Management Ltd (Groww AMC), valuing the mutual fund business at around ₹2,500 crore, according to regulatory disclosures filed on Tuesday. The proposed investment of up to ₹580 crore will be split between a secondary share purchase of about ₹381 crore from Groww’s parent entity and a primary capital infusion of nearly ₹199 crore into Groww AMC, the filings showed. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. As part of the deal, State Street Investment Management will acquire up to 23 per cent of Groww AMC’s fully diluted share capital. Despite this, the US-based asset manager will hold less than 5 per cent of the voting rights in the mutual fund arm. Post-transaction, Groww AMC will cease to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd, the listed parent of the Groww platform. Groww entered the mutual fund business in 2023 after acquiring the asset management company from Indiabulls, marking its formal foray into the asset management space. Since the acquisition, the company has expanded its product offerings amid a sharp rise in retail participation in capital markets and growing adoption of mutual funds among first-time investors. “India stands out as a market of immense opportunity, with a rising middle class, favourable demographics, and a rapid shift toward embracing modern investment products,” said Yie-Hsin Hung, chief executive of State Street Investment Management. “Our partnership with Groww AMC allows us to participate directly in the growth of India’s domestic asset management market, deliver a range of investment exposures to a broader population, and build a pipeline of Indian exposures for global distribution,” she added. Welcoming the investment, Groww said the partnership would help deepen its asset management capabilities. “State Street Investment Management is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and we are delighted to welcome them as an investor and strategic partner in Groww AMC,” said Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief operating officer of Groww. “This partnership will enable us to bring global best practices and sophisticated investment products to Indian investors, strengthening our long-term commitment to building a world-class asset management platform in India,” he added. State Street’s entry into India’s mutual fund space comes amid growing global interest in the country’s asset management industry. The move follows a similar push by rival BlackRock, which recently formed a joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd to tap into India’s expanding domestic savings and investment market.

Title: JumpCloud unveils new AI capabilities to secure and manage enterprise AI adoption
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/14/jumpcloud-unveils-new-ai-capabilities-secure-manage-enterprise-ai-adoption/
Time Published: 2026-01-14T13:00:32Z

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 14 2026 by Duncan Riley JumpCloud Inc., which offers a unified platform for identity, access and devices, today unvieled new artificial intelligence capabilities to fuel safe innovation by allowing organizations to accelerate AI adoption and ensure compliance and control for all types of identities. JumpCloud’s new features are designed to allow organizations to see, secure and automate AI management and to allow them to focus on proactive information technology enablement and safe innovation. The company says the approach gives organizations a competitive edge and helps them stay compliant. The new capabilities provide control and intelligent IT foundations that are necessary for managing AI usage across the entire enterprise. Using the new capabilities, organizations can securely integrate all their AI tools and speed up their path to success. Key benefits include the ability to automatically detect shadow AI usage and hidden machine identities. Organizations gain centralized insights into who is using what, where and with what data risks. Users can also find data instantly, the company says, including surfacing critical data with natural language to navigate the platform. The capabilities include zero trust for AI agents, with support for managing machine-to-machine and AI-to-resource access via a unified policy. A complementary AI Admin Assistant streamlines day-to-day operations by handling high-frequency administrative tasks through conversational intelligence. Other features include the ability to generate rapid, reliable scripts that cut down the time and effort needed to write or debug scripts and integration with existing AI tools. “The market has been selling fear of AI, pushing organizations to simply ‘detect and block’ new technologies,” said Joel Rennich, senior vice president of product management at JumpCloud. “We believe that stifles progress. By using our platform, AI becomes an engine driving immediate efficiency across the organization. We are enabling the natural human desire for efficiency — user-led innovation — safely, turning a corporate liability into a source of competitive advantage.” The company was previously in the news on Jan. 8 when it announced that it had acquired MacSolution Tecnologia Ltd., the largest managed service provider in the Americas and an existing JumpCloud partner, for an undisclosed price. JumpCloud is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $408 million across ten rounds, including a Series F round of $159 million on a $2.65 billion valuation in September 2021. Investors in the company include Sapphire Ventures, BlackRock Inc., Blue Owl Capital Inc., Whale Rock Capital Management, Sands Capital Management, Endeavor Catalyst GP, General Atlantic, H.I.G.

Title: Ireland to experience more extreme weather - expert
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/2026/0114/1553066-ireland-climate-change/
Time Published: 2026-01-14T12:46:01Z

Ireland will experience more flooding events and extreme weather events unless it transitions away from fossil fuels, Met Éireann climatologist Paul Moore has said. It comes as the European Union Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that 2025 was the third warmest year on record. Speaking on RTÉ's Today With David McCullagh, Mr Moore said: "The higher the temperatures go, the more extreme events that we can expect." He said the 1.5C level of global warming above pre-industrial levels threshold was laid out so that it was deemed possible we could keep under to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "That hasn’t happened, so we are continuing towards that trend at an accelerated rate. The higher the temperatures go, the more moisture that can hold in the atmosphere. "That means more flooding events and more extreme weather events for us," Mr Moore said. "Unless we can bring them (greenhouse gas emissions) down to zero emissions or to net-zero emissions, then the temperatures will continue to rise. "It is putting out the call to get our act together globally and to bring down emissions so we can stop this trend," Mr Moore said. Mr Moore said the forecaster did some rapid attribution studies with Maynooth University’s ICARUS Climate Research Centre called the 'WASITUS’ study, which he said found that Wexford rainfall due to Storm Claudia was made 12% heavier because of a warming climate and that it is twice as likely. He added that a study done for last summer showed that it was the warmest summer on record in Ireland and was 40 times more likely to be a record-breaking summer in terms of temperature than pre-industrial times. "What once was a 600-year event is now a one in 15-year event, due to the warming climate," he said. He said the positive drawn from the report is that the technology is out there for us to "transition away from fossil fuels". "That is the positive as long as we do it," he said. Technology improving, says public policy advisor Meanwhile, public policy advisor Oisín Coughlan said it [climate change] "has been coming faster than the models predicted than when we hoped when we signed the Paris Agreement". He reiterated Mr Moore’s point on the technology that is out there, which he said has "improved hugely over the last ten years". Solar is now the cheapest way to make electricity everywhere in the world, he said. He stressed that the "technology has really moved but the politics has got worse". "I really think the next five years is actually a battle between the technology and the politics. The politics needs to catch up with the technology," he said. Mr Coughlan said these positives are cheaper electricity, less dependence on Russian or other fossil fuels leading to warmer homes and lower fuel bills. However, he said "getting there is the challenge". He said the Government needs to do a lot more for people on the expense of the retrofit process and to work with groups that are in touch with those in energy poverty. "We have to be much more proactive about how we do this and we need to accompany people through what is a challenging process, but the outcome will be very positive," Mr Coughlan said. He said removing our reliance on fossil fuels is in our own "national interest" and not about "some whimsical environmental desire". Mr Coughlan said 20 years ago it was hard to make people interested in climate change in Ireland. "Now we are seeing it, Storm Éowyn, the floods in Midleton, the floods in Wexford last year. We all know that the rain now is more intensive bursts... and the warmer summers and the warmer nights… we are seeing it here," he said. On infrastructure, Mr Coughlan said "our country isn’t built for the climate that we are moving into". "So as well as cutting pollution and saving money, we also do need to start the adaption, the coping of what is about to come," he said. © RTÉ 2026.

Title: California's Billionaires Rage at Huge Tax Bill to Fund Illegal Migrants' Health Subsidies

California’s stock market billionaires are angrily denouncing a proposed tax to fund healthcare for the millions of illegal migrants they welcomed into their state. The tech sector “is getting what they had coming ….[after] pushing for open borders and unbridled employment visas,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, which opposes the H-1B program. He continued: A strong, middle class that can form families, pay for college educations without going into debt, and pay for health care, doesn’t need this kind of a [tax] grift … but now it’s on the tech bros to pay for the health care for all these illegal immigrants — and all the healthcare workers who have to service them. “You funded Democrats and the people who censored, locked down, and tormented us. That was your political gamble,” said a message from conservative activist Mike Cernovich. In a later tweet, he added: 90% of Tech and VC [executives] are cultural Marxists with a hatred of Americans. That’s why they want infinite [subordinate] H-1B’s. They hate [citizens]. But, he added, “There’s a split happening … We can take back the country with 10% of them.” Billionaire Rethink The political drama is forcing many billionaires to recognize that their pro-migration policies are importing resentment and poverty, so shifting national politics against their pocketbooks. The proposed tax is likely to appear on California’s ballot in November. Once passed, the measure would require roughly 200 billionaires to pay a share of the controlling value they own in companies, including companies they founded. Proponents say the ballot would raise $100 billion, mostly for healthcare programs. On January 10, the Wall Street Journal quoted an official at the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, saying, “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives…the few [billionaires] who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a supposed moderate Democrat, has supported the proposed tax. He needs the support of Democratic-aligned unions for his expected presidential campaign. Many billionaires are blasting the tax as a crude wealth-grab — and some are leaving the state. “I love California … but stupid wealth tax proposals like this make it irresponsible for me not to plan leaving the state,” said DoorDash founder Andy Fang, who gained billions by creating an industry of poorly-paid migrant delivery workers. The original founders of Google Inc., for example, have reportedly moved themselves to low-tax Florida. “That math doesn’t math,” said Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley investor with ethnic roots in Sri Lanka, which is a small island off of southern India. “Everyone that is potentially touched by this will now leave, and all that will result is a massive hole in California’s finances that you will be forced to fill.” The Billionaires’ Bill for Migration Some of the outraged billionaires recognize that mass migration created the political base for the wealth grab. “After blindly funding the Left for years, Silicon Valley is finally realizing what time it is. Dinner time,” said David Sacks, a California investor and author who is now advising Trump’s administration and moving his legal address to Texas. Silicon Valley is “on the menu,” he added. “The blast radius, however, of healthcare for illegal aliens, will be the end of Silicon Valley” in California, said Palihapitiya. “I care about two issues: I care about immigration and re-establishing the deterrent capacity of America,” Palantir CEO Alex Karp told the New York Times in December. “We are on the side of working-class Americans.” RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers “This has always been inevitable and is not due to Newsom or any individual,” said Elon Musk, who is increasingly critical of mass migration. “The Democratic Party is utterly controlled by the unions and the trial lawyers and California is a one-party state.” Those concerns were echoed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on January 12: Open immigration would be something interesting if we gave people nothing [in welfare]. Because if we gave them nothing, if they weren’t smart enough, capable, entrepreneurial enough, driven enough, they would starve to death, and so they wouldn’t stay here, they would self deport. But if you give them welfare, and you’re going to give them food stamps, and you’re gonna give them housing and you give them this, everybody’s gonna come and just leech off of us, and we’re going to pay and pay and pay. Separately, a growing number of American CEOs — including some left-wingers — are increasingly alarmed at Muslim migration into the United States. They include Larry Fink, founder of the giant BlackRock investment firm, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook and Meta, and investor David Sacks. Similarly, many writers and advocates have stepped back from full-throated advocacy for migration amid the growing clout of Islamic activists, who now include the new Mayor of New York City. Buying a Fix The billionaires are spending some of their cash to win a political fix. “It’s time for Silicon Valley to actually get involved and organized in California,” said Gerry Tan, an investor in many tech companies. “I will fight,” said Fang, the DoorDash founder who has funded many prior political battles. On January 13, they won support from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is planning his own run for President in 2028. “This will be defeated — there’s no question in my mind … I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state,” he told the New York Times, which added: While Mr. Newsom helped stop past wealth tax bills in the State Capitol, the new proposal is being driven by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West through the initiative process and beyond the reach of his veto pen. … “I want to be adamant and very clear: This is a ballot measure we are putting on the ballot,” [Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for the labor union] said. “We’re going to have voters vote on it in November.” But the billionaires have yet to offer any concessions to the many millions of American voters who have lost wages and wealth amid the billionaires’ stock-market boom and far-left political advocacy. Those wealth-sharing concessions could include elite support for ending the Extraction Migration economy that damages ordinary Americans. The billionaires might even offer curbs on the H-1B visa program that is deliberately used to push millions of American college graduates out of productive and innovative careers. “They should take the same lesson that an element of the business community took in the 1920s,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He added: They saw the political changes related to [1920s] anarchism … and immigration, and they concluded that it might be worth paying a nickel an hour more [in wages] to have American workers instead of these kinds of political consequences. Obviously, the nickel an hour doesn’t apply anymore here, but it’s the same concept: cheap [migrant] labor not only creates a lot of welfare costs and political costs. In 1924, Congress passed an immigration reform that set the stage for the United States’ dominance in the 20th Century. Migration Grows Poverty The billionaires may be able to buy a short-term victory. But they are struggling against a self-created political tide in many states where voters have been pushed on their backs by flat wages and rising home costs caused by migration. In those states, many progressives are eager to drain vast wealth and political power from the billionaire class for their left-wing priorities. States should “follow examples like what is being proposed in Rhode Island, Michigan, and other states,” said a January 12 press statement from a union-led group titled May Day Strong. “A millionaire tax [in Massachusetts] has generated at least $5.7 billion in revenue since 2023 to pay for schools, public transit, and infrastructure,” the “Tax the Rich Policy” statement said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) is slamming the pro-migration technology donors in California, including FWD.us leader Reid Hoffman, as well as Dustin Moskovitz, Marc Andreessen, and Patrick Collison: Hoffman wants Democratic candidates to stand with the billionaires for higher [water and electricity] costs. Running on small, vague ideas that may also raise costs for families—instead of on full-throated, economic populist ideas—is a terrible plan for winning elections. In November, predicted Lynn, “anyone who isn’t a billionaire is going to eventually back this [ballot measure], because that’s how democracy works.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: “And the Billionaires Are Laughing Somewhere in America”

Time Published: 2026-01-14T06:40:07Z

This article by veteran war correspondent and GR associate editor Felicity Arbuthnot was first published in 2015. While the world trembles under the crescendo of bombs, “billionaires are laughing somewhere in America.” —Global Research, January 14, 2026 *** “If I could shed a tear for every home that bombs destroy, I’d never stop crying “If I could hold each shattered body, each baby stilled at birth, I’d have no time for loneliness, I’d spend all my days embracing the people of this savaged earth, “And the billionaires are laughing somewhere in America.” (Song for Basra, David Rovics.) If you have ever mentally yelled at the screen, radio or hard copy when looking for truth, fact and balance in the news and wondered how much of the mainstream media is bought or biased, the answer is simple. Just two examples, the US and UK. In the US six corporations own 90% of the media – but these corporations in turn must satisfy their shareholders – each one who holds them financial hostage to the tune of million of dollars. The list of investors is long (1) but a few examples (2013 figures): Gannett owns USA Today and local newspapers & TV stations in 37 US states including the Detroit Free Press, Indianapolis Star and Cincinnati Inquirer. Just one of many mega investors is JP Morgan Asset Management who hold 21,915,328 shares at a 2013 value of $330,702,000. In the UK there are twelve major newspaper groups: “Over a quarter (27.3 per cent) of the press is owned by Lord Rothermere and 24.9 per cent by Rupert Murdoch – between them these two men have over 50 per cent of the printed press.” (2) Figures are also from 2013. Nine of these groups are supporters of David Cameron’s Tory Party which enjoined in murdering Libya’s Leader, near all his family and small grandchildren, reducing the formerly flourishing country to a ruined, failed state – with large swathes of the British public buying into the murderous carnage thanks to the war fever drummed up by the Cameron backing media. This pattern of ownership is broadly replicated throughout the West where now the same misrepresentation of Syria is in journalistic overdrive. The BBC is vying to be leader of the pack talking of “civil war” with one Middle East correspondent even dropping the last vestige of “impartiality” and declaring “Assad must go.” The entire organization long abandoned any pretense of professionalism and impartiality even ditching his status and title of “President.” In contrast to the Mainstream media, Global Research has no $multi-million donors, but as the world again reaches yet another manufactured and most dangerous crisis, truly independent analysis is the vital weapon for the non-partisan truth, knowledge and a tool for prevention from repeating the tragedies of the past. It is, as Dr Binoy Kampmark, distinguished GR contributor and lecturer at RMIT University, Melbourne has said: “a vital democratic forum.” Of course, as Global Research writers pointed out (3) there is no “civil war” in Syria, the country’s nightmare was plotted from inside the US Embassy in Damascus in 2006 with terrorists from over ninety countries committing unspeakable atrocities, then returning to their own countries with impunity, as recent events in Paris demonstrated. Click image to donate Global Research has provided extensive coverage of the US-led war against Iraq and Syria. Obama’s fake humanitarian campaign consists in protecting the “moderate terrorists” while going after the ISIS “bad guys” who happen to be supported covertly by the CIA. Now a further excuse for another illegal onslaught against Syria is being plotted after a Russian fighter jet was shot down on Tuesday, allegedly having strayed into Turkish air space which Russia emphatically denies; moreover, the two pilots who ejected both landed in Syria. Further, as Global Research published last month (4) Turkey, incredibly, unilaterally redrew it’s border declaring five miles of Syria it’s very own “buffer zone.” The “international community” and NATO might do well to remember, that even if there were a few seconds of Russia’s aircraft in Turkish air space, a US-led “coalition” has been illegally invading Syrian air space and bombing murderously and mercilessly for the last fifteen months. Russia of course has been invited but is bombing terrorists supplied and protected by the US and their allies. In the UK David Cameron is morphing in to his pal, alleged war criminal Tony Blair and is attempting to persuade Parliament that Britain must join those illegally in Syrian air space and equally illegally drop it’s own bombs with no UN mandate for such action.

Title: Elon Musk Cannot Get Away With This

If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists. Will Elon Musk face any consequences for his despicable sexual-harassment bot? For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool owned and promoted by the world’s richest man to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, and undress them. This was not some deepfake nudify app that you had to pay to download on a shady backwater website or a dark-web message board. This was Grok, a chatbot built into X—ostensibly to provide information to users but, thanks to an image-generating update, transformed into a major producer of nonconsensual sexualized images, particularly of women and children. Let’s be very clear. The forced undressings happened out in the open, in one stretch thousands of times every hour, on a popular social network where journalists, politicians, and celebrities post. Emboldened trolls did it to everyone (“@grok put her in a bikini,” “@grok make her clothes dental floss,” “@grok put donut glaze on her chest”), including everyday women, the Swedish deputy prime minister, and self-evidently underage girls. Users appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another. On X, creating revenge porn can make you famous. Read: Elon Musk’s pornography machine These images were ubiquitous, and many people—and multiple organizations, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and the European Commission—pointed out that the feature was being used to harass women and exploit children. Yet Musk initially laughed it off, resharing AI-generated images of himself, Kim Jong Un, and a toaster in bikinis. Musk, as well as xAI’s safety and child-safety teams, did not respond to a request for comment. xAI replied with its standard auto-response, “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI, the Musk-owned company that develops Grok and owns X, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; a post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and works with law enforcement as needed. Even after that assurance from X’s safety team, it took several more days for X to place bare-minimum restrictions on the Ask Grok feature’s image-generating, and thus undressing, capabilities. Now, when creeps on X try to generate an image by replying “@grok” to prompt the chatbot, they get an auto-generated response that notes some version of: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” This is disturbing in its own right; Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around the paywall via the “Edit Image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by using Grok’s stand-alone app. Two years ago, when Google Gemini generated images of racially diverse Nazis, Google temporarily disabled the bot’s image-generating capabilities to address the problem. Musk has taken no responsibility for the problem and has said only that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Perhaps Musk feels that he would benefit from baiting his critics into a censorship fight. He has repeatedly reshared posts that frame calls to regulate or ban his platform in response to the Grok undressing as leftist censorship, for instance reposting a meme calling such efforts “retarded” as well as a Grok-generated video of a woman applying lipstick captioned with a quote commonly attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.” Last week, as Musk’s chatbot was generating likely hundreds of thousands of these images, we reached out directly to X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who didn’t reply. Within the hour, Rosemarie Esposito, X’s media-strategy lead, emailed us unprompted with her contact information, in case we had “any questions” in the future. We asked her a series of questions about the tool and how X could allow such a thing to operate. She did not reply. We’ve reached out multiple times to more than a dozen key investors listed in xAI’s two most recent public fundraising rounds—the latest of which, announced during this Grok-enabled sexual-harassment spree, valued the company at about $230 billion—to ask if they endorsed the use of X and Grok to generate and distribute nonconsensual sexualized images. These investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Management & Research Company, the Saudi firm Kingdom Holding Company, and the state-owned investment firms of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We asked whether they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products and, if yes, why they felt justified in continuing to invest in a company that has enabled the public sexual harassment of women and exploitation of children on the internet. BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baron Capital declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley initially told us that she could find no documentation that the company is a major investor in xAI. After we sent a public announcement from xAI that lists Morgan Stanley as a key investor in its Series C fundraising round, the spokesperson did not answer our questions. The other companies did not respond. We also reached out to several companies that provide the infrastructure for X and Grok—in other words, that allow these products to exist on the internet: Google and Apple, which offer both X and Grok on their app stores; Microsoft and Oracle, which run Grok on their cloud services; and Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok. We asked if they endorsed the use of these products to create nonconsensual sexual images of women and children, and whether they would take steps to prevent this from continuing. None responded except for Microsoft, which told us that it does not provide cloud services, chips, or hosting services for xAI other than offering the Grok language model—without image generation—on its enterprise platform, Microsoft Foundry. The silence says everything. As all of this unfolded, xAI made several major announcements: new Grok products for businesses; upgraded video-generating capabilities; that enormous fundraising round. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX’s headquarters in Texas and joined Musk for a press conference in which Hegseth said, “I want to thank you, Elon, and your incredible team” for bringing Grok to the military. (Later this year, Grok will join Google Gemini on a new Pentagon platform called GenAI.mil that the Defense Department says will offer advanced AI tools to military and civilian personnel.) We asked the DOD if it endorsed xAI’s sexualized material or if it would reconsider its partnership with the company in response. In a statement, a Pentagon official told us only that the department’s policy on the use of AI “fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations” and that “any unlawful activity” by its personnel “will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.” Read: What are people still doing on X? Government bodies in the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union have said that they will investigate X, while Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok, but Musk appears to be unfazed by these efforts—and also seems to be receiving help in brushing them off. Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, has said that, should the U.K. ban X, America “has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access in authoritarian, closed societies.” At the moment, Musk seems to be not only getting away with this but also reveling in it. Although governments appear to be furious at Musk, they also seem impotent. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last Wednesday that the Grok-generated images “are unacceptable and a clear violation of” the law but that he was “encouraged that X has announced that they’re taking these violations seriously.” Throughout that same day, Grok continued to comply with user requests to undress people. Yesterday, Cruz posted on X a photo of himself with his arm around Musk and the caption “Always great seeing this guy 🚀.” And it’s already beginning to feel as if the scandal—the world’s richest man enabling the widespread harassment of women and children—is waning, crowded out by a new year of relentless news cycles. But this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet. Grok’s ability to undress minors is not, as Musk might have you think, an exercise in free-speech maximalism. It is, however, a speech issue: By turning sexual harassment and revenge porn into a meme with viral distribution, the platform is allowing its worst, most vindictive users to silence and intimidate anyone they desire. The retaliation on X has been obvious—women who’ve stood up in opposition to the tool have been met with anonymous trolls asking Grok to put them in a bikini. Social platforms have long leaned on the argument that they aren’t subject to the same defamation laws as publishers and media companies. But this latest debacle, Musk’s reaction, and the silence from so many of X’s investors and peer companies were all active choices—and symptoms of a broader crisis of impunity that’s begun to seep into American culture. They were the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs bowing to Donald Trump. Of financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors such as cryptocurrency and meme stocks—a braggadocious, “get the bag” ethos that has no room for greed or shame. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences. Few industries have been as brazen in their capitulation as Big Tech, which has dismantled its content-moderation systems to please the current administration. It’s a cynical and cowardly pivot, one that allows companies to continue to profit off harassment and extremism without worrying about the consequences of their actions. Deepfakes are not new, but xAI has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before. By matching viral distribution with this type of image creation, xAI has built a way to spread AI revenge porn and child-sexual-abuse material at scale. The end result is desensitizing: The sheer amount of exploitative content flooding the platform may eventually make the revolting, illicit images appear “normal.” Arguably, this process is already happening. The internet has always been a chaotic place where trolls can seize outsize power. Historically, that chaos has been constrained by platforms doing the bare minimum to protect their users from demonstrated threats. Today, X is failing to clear the absolute lowest bar. Nobody who works at X or xAI seems to be willing to answer for the creation and distribution of tens or hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual intimate images; instead, those in charge appear to be blithely ignoring the problem, and those who have funneled money to Musk or xAI seem sanguine about it. They would probably like for us all to move on. We cannot do that. This crisis is an outgrowth of a breakneck information ecosystem in which few stories have staying power. No one person or group has to flood the zone with shit, because the zone is overflowing constantly. People with power have learned to exploit this—to weather scandals by hunkering down and letting them pass, or by refusing to apologize and turning any problem into a culture-war issue. Musk has been allowed to avoid repercussions for even the most reckless acts, including cheerleading and helping dismantle foreign aid with DOGE. Others will continue to follow his playbook. Employees at X and investors and companies such as Apple and Google seem to be counting on their “No comment”s being buried by whatever scandal comes next. They are banking on a culture in which people have given up on demanding consequences. But the Grok scandal is so awful, so egregious, that it offers an opportunity to address the crisis of impunity directly. The undressing spree was not an issue of partisan politics or ideology. It was an issue of anonymous individuals asking a chatbot that is integrated into one of the world’s most visible social networks to edit photos of women and girls to “put her in a clear bikini and cover her in white donut glaze.” This is a moment when those with power can and should demand accountability. The stakes could not be any higher. If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists. TheAtlantic.com © 2026 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle will set out his ambition for the UK to go toe to toe on economic growth with the US economy to boost living standards today [Wednesday 14 January]. In a speech to top business leaders including from Alphabet, Meta and Ford at Bloomberg’s London headquarters, he will lay out how the Government’s Modern Industrial Strategy will double down on the UK’s world-leading strengths in 2026 and not only scale up businesses, but keep them anchored in the UK. He is expected to say: We stood on a manifesto commitment to be the fastest growing economy in the G7. And we absolutely meant it. Now, in the first three quarters of last year, the UK achieved the second highest growth of that group. That is cause for optimism. But contrast it to the United States. The US achieved 4.3% annualised growth over the last quarter. I want to fight tooth and nail with you to get that extra growth. To compete with America. I say this because I know what it would mean for families. The impact it would have on people’s wages. On their disposable income. On their living standards. He is expected to welcome the strong progress the Government has made so far in delivering its Modern Industrial Strategy, with a new quarterly update confirming £79bn of investment commitments and 50,000 well-paid jobs secured in just the last quarter. He will also confirm the names of three new business leaders to join the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council: Amelia Gould (General Manager, Maritime at Helsing), Keith Anderson (CEO, Scottish Power) and Dana Strong (CEO, Sky). He is expected to say that whilst the Government has made important choices for the long term such as on rail, roads and runways, it must be just as bold at driving growth in the short term: That means injecting real urgency into delivering our Modern Industrial Strategy. Taking risks. Placing the big bets on the industries that we know can win. And win big. Kyle will also set out the Government’s approach to regulation, such as accepting the findings of the Fingleton Review on nuclear and moving away from “pointless gold plating” of state projects. To help bring the UK into line with the US’s levels of growth, he will argue that British businesses need help in scaling up to encourage them to stay in Britain. This will include large new investments from the British Business Bank and more firepower for UK Export Finance. He is expected to say: Very soon, I will be setting out how we’ll go even further to reduce that regulatory burden and ensure our most promising start-ups don’t need to leave our shores to reach their full potential. Over the coming days and weeks, we will be doing more – a lot more – to move the dial. To go for growth at every opportunity. He will highlight the Government’s work to reduce burdens for business since his appointment, including a £230 million reduction in admin costs and energy price support such as the Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, slashing businesses’ energy costs. The reception comes ahead of the Business Secretary’s attendance at Davos next week where he will engage with business leaders and set out why the UK is truly the best place in the world to invest, with a culture of entrepreneurship, world-class education and certainty for business. Other attendees at the reception will include the Director Generals of the CBI and BCC, Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy, and executives from Heathrow, Blackrock, McKinsey, BP and AstraZeneca. Keith Anderson has been CEO of ScottishPower since 2018. Prior to his appointment as Chief Executive, Keith was CEO of ScottishPower Renewables and led Iberdrola’s international offshore business. Before joining ScottishPower, Keith worked with some major financial institutions including The Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life, as well as working as a management consultant with E&Y. Keith has an Honorary Degree from Strathclyde University and is an Honorary Fellow of the Energy Institute. Amelia Gould CEng FIET is the General Manager, Maritime for Helsing and leads the Group’s work in the maritime domain. Amelia has over 20 years of strategic and operational delivery experience in the global defence sector. She began her career as a Royal Navy Engineering Officer where she served for 11 years before moving into enterprise architecture and then joining BAE Systems, where she held senior technical and leadership roles.

Title: Ethereum stuck between staking strength and derivatives risk – What’s next?

Ethereum’s bid–ask imbalance signals “caution.” Risk assets are stuck in a tug-of-war between supply and demand. Consequently, breaking out of the ongoing market chop requires spotting a bid–ask imbalance. According to AMBCrypto, how top caps navigate this imbalance will likely determine their next directional move. For Ethereum [ETH], early signs are already showing, putting the usual “buy the fear vs. sell the strength” question back into focus. Notably, BitMine seems to have picked a side, staking another $340 million in ETH. Source: ValidatorQueue And it doesn’t stop there: BMNR now has $3.69 billion in total staked ETH. Meanwhile, about 2.16 million ETH are waiting to be staked over the following days, potentially bringing total staked Ethereum to nearly 37.8 million, an all-time high for this period, assuming the exit queue remains at zero. In short, Ethereum’s chop around $3k looks like a textbook breakout scenario, with bids dominating the action. In this context, could ETH be setting up a bear trap, catching the short side off-guard? Liquidity in derivatives is thickening as the market navigates uncertainty. CoinGlass data shows nearly $2.95 billion in short clusters at near-term risk if ETH moves another 11%. Meanwhile, Binance’s 4H perpetual contract is about 70% long, suggesting late-long positions are starting to catch up. Given Ethereum’s solid technicals and staking flows, this positioning makes sense. That said, calling it a full-blown supply squeeze might be a stretch, as around 160k ETH have moved into reserves just this past week. Source: CryptoQuant Moreover, another BlackRock deposit has hit the network. Against this backdrop, analysts note ETH’s Open Interest (OI) is rebounding to early-October levels. A rising OI generally implies more traders are opening positions, setting the stage for sharper moves in either direction. That’s where Ethereum’s bid–ask imbalance comes in. Staking is tightening supply, but sellers haven’t stepped away yet. In short, long exposure is building faster than demand, leaving the bid fragile. Hence, ETH’s chop remains exposed to a bull trap rather than a breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Here’s how the US government now offers a path to a new all-time high for Bitcoin and crypto CLARITY

The CLARITY Act introduces a regulatory framework to harmonize SEC and CFTC oversight, redefining asset classification and safeguarding investor interests. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Jan. 13, the US Senate Banking Committee released the full text of the highly anticipated Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY) ahead of its expected markup this week. The 278-page draft abandons the strategy of picking winners on a token-by-token basis. Instead, it constructs a comprehensive “lane system” that assigns jurisdiction based on the functional lifecycle of a digital asset. Speaking on the legislation, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott said: “[This legislation] gives everyday Americans the protections and certainty they deserve. Investors and innovators can’t wait forever while Washington stands still, and bad actors exploit the system. This legislation puts Main Street first, cracks down on criminals and foreign adversaries, and keeps the future of finance here in the United States.” The proposal arrives at a pivotal moment for the industry. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, described the legislation as the “Punxsutawney Phil of this crypto winter,” noting that if the bill passes and is signed into law, the market could be “heading to new all-time highs.” Notably, crypto bettors on prediction markets appear optimistic, with Polymarket users currently assigning the CLARITY Act an 80% chance of being signed into law this year. However, the clock is ticking, as Senators have a tight 48-hour window to propose amendments to the text. The core of the draft creates a legislative bridge between the two primary US market regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Joint effort by SEC and CFTC signals end of policy uncertainty, aligning with U.S. crypto innovation goals. The Clarity Act revives and codifies a policy distinction often debated in legal circles: that tokens sold with a promoter’s promise may begin their life looking like securities but can evolve into commodity-like network assets as control disperses. To operationalize this, the bill defines an “ancillary asset.” This category covers network tokens whose value relies on the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts” of an originator or a “related person.” The legislation directs the SEC to specify exactly how to apply those concepts through rulemaking, effectively giving the agency the front-end oversight of crypto projects. Once a token falls into this lane, the draft leans heavily into an SEC-led disclosure regime that mirrors public equity standards. The required disclosure list is extensive and intentionally “public-company-ish.” It mandates that issuers provide financial statements that must be reviewed or audited, depending on the size of the raise. It also requires ownership details, records of related-party transactions, token distributions, code audits, and tokenomics. Additionally, issuers must provide market data such as average prices and highs/lows. However, the bill provides a clear handoff by repeatedly anchoring the definition of a “digital commodity” to the Commodity Exchange Act. It treats the CFTC as the relevant counterpart regulator for the market plumbing, requiring the SEC to notify its sister agency of certain certifications. Put simply, the SEC regulates the “promoter” questions (disclosure, anti-fraud, and fundraising). On the other hand, the CFTC oversees trading venues and intermediaries that handle the assets once they are traded as commodities. This framework also imposes strict investor protection rules on intermediaries themselves. The draft states that Regulation Best Interest applies to broker-dealer recommendations involving digital commodities and that investment advisers’ fiduciary duty extends to advice on these assets. This ensures that even if Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities, the brokers selling them to retail investors do not get a regulatory free pass regarding suitability and conflicts of interest. For market participants holding major assets, the most immediate impact comes from a specific carve-out tied to exchange-traded products (ETPs). The text states that a network token is not an ancillary asset if its unit has been the principal asset of an exchange-traded product listed on a registered national securities exchange as of January 1, 2026. This provision serves as a functional on-ramp to commodity status, bypassing years of litigation and SEC debate over decentralization. In practice, this “ETF gatekeeping” clause captures Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their established footprint. This means that digital assets like XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, Dogecoin, and Chainlink that have achieved this status would be treated the same as BTC and ETH. Beyond asset classification, the draft offers significant relief for the Ethereum ecosystem regarding staking. The draft addresses the lingering fear that staking rewards could be classified as securities income by defining them as “gratuitous distributions.” The bill explicitly includes multiple staking pathways in this definition, covering self-staking, self-custodial staking with a third party, and even liquid staking structures. This is particularly noteworthy, given that the SEC previously filed legal actions against firms like Kraken for their staking activity. The firm will pay a large penalty and face a permanent injunction. Crucially, the text establishes a presumption that a gratuitous distribution is not, by itself, an offer or sale of a security. The language regarding “self-custodial with a third party” is precise, noting that it applies where the third-party operator does not maintain custody or control of the staked token. This creates a tailored safe lane for non-custodial and liquid staking designs, though it leaves custodial exchange staking open to continued regulatory scrutiny. The legislation also incorporates the “stablecoin rewards fight” directly into the market-structure package. They earn $176B on Fed reserves and $187B in swipe fees, and now they’re lobbying to shut the rewards door. Section 404 of the Clarity Act appears to hand the banking sector a victory regarding yield-bearing instruments. The latest text prohibits companies from paying interest or yield solely for holding a payment stablecoin. However, legal experts note a critical distinction in how the bill constructs the yield economy. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys, noted that CLARITY deliberately allows stablecoins to be used to earn yield, but it draws a bright legal line between “the stablecoin” and “the yield product.” The bill adopts the definition of a “payment stablecoin” from the GENIUS Act, requiring such coins to be fully backed, redeemable at par, and used for settlement, without giving holders any entitlement to interest or profits from the issuer. This ensures that a token like USDC cannot pay yield just for holding it, which would classify it as an illegal security or shadow banking product. Yet, Title IV includes a section on “preserving rewards for stablecoin holders.” This allows users to earn yield by utilizing stablecoins in other systems, such as DeFi lending protocols, on-chain money markets, or custodial interest accounts. PayPal's PYUSD trading volume spikes following its integration with major Solana DeFi protocols. Under this framework, the stablecoin remains a payment instrument, while the “wrapper” or the yield-generating product becomes the regulated financial entity (whether as a security, commodity pool, or banking product). This architecture effectively prevents regulators from classifying a stablecoin as a security simply because it can be used to earn interest. Thus, it preserves the viability of the DeFi yield economy atop “boring” payment tokens. The new draft also addresses the contentious issue of decentralized finance (DeFi) interfaces. Hughes pointed out that the bill moves away from a simplistic “wallets vs. websites” debate and instead establishes a “control test” to determine regulatory obligations. According to the text, a web interface is legally treated as mere software (and thus not subject to broker-dealer registration) if it does not hold user funds, control private keys, or have the authority to block or reorder transactions. This creates a statutory safe harbor for non-custodial platforms like Uniswap, 1inch, and MetaMask’s swap UI. It classifies them as software publishers rather than financial intermediaries. Conversely, the bill strictly regulates any operator that possesses control. If a website can move funds without a user signature, batch trades, or route orders through proprietary liquidity, it is classified as a broker or exchange. This captures centralized entities like Coinbase and Binance, as well as custodial bridges and CeFi yield platforms. The proposed Senate bill seeks to impose KYC on DeFi, sparking fears of an exodus to offshore liquidity platforms. Despite the optimism from some quarters, the bill’s release has triggered a “mad scramble” among legal experts to identify critical flaws before the 48-hour amendment window closes. Jake Chervinsky, the Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, pointed out that lobbyists and policy experts are racing to address what he described as “many” critical issues before the markup deadline. According to him: “A lot has changed since the draft that came out in September, and the devil is in the details. Amendments are due by 5 pm ET, so it's a mad scramble today identifying critical issues to fix in markup. Sadly there are many.” Meanwhile, some critics also argue that the bill introduces existential threats to privacy and decentralization. Aaron Day, an independent Senate candidate, described the mandatory trade surveillance requirements as taking a page from the “NSA playbook.” Day highlighted provisions for “universal registration” that would require exchanges, brokers, and even “associated persons” to register, effectively burying the concept of anonymous participation. He also pointed to mandates for “government custodians,” arguing that self-custody for regulated activity effectively becomes illegal. He said: “BlackRock and Wall Street get clear on-ramps while DeFi gets strangled in the crib. The SEC and CFTC get expanded empires and fresh revenue streams. You get watched. Tracked. Controlled.” Beyond privacy concerns, reports indicate the industry faces two specific policy hurdles in the latest draft. Crypto journalist Sander Lutz reported that the language around stablecoin yield has left both banks and crypto advocates dissatisfied. While banks appear to have secured a ban on interest for holding stablecoins, loopholes regarding “activity rewards” and loyalty programs remain murky. Lutz also noted that the Senate Banking Committee's addition of an “unexpected section on DeFi caught industry lobbyists off guard. According to him, the section's new definitions could rope decentralized protocols into strict regulatory frameworks. CLARITY Act vote ahead As the Senate Banking Committee moves toward the Clarity Act markup, the political landscape remains fluid. While the bill cleared the House last year, the inclusion of banking-sector priorities, such as restrictions on self-hosted wallets or prohibitions on CBDCs, remains a point of interest for negotiators. With the Senate substitute text now effectively resetting the terms of engagement, the industry is watching to see if this bill will finally signal an early spring for US crypto regulation. However, Lutz noted that the current frictions have led to a darkening outlook among some insiders.

Title: Gold tops $4.6K as crypto enters macro week: Coincidence or early warning?

Rates spike, liquidity shifts: Is crypto at risk? The crypto market is heading into another macro-heavy week. This time, however, the main headwind is “rate cuts.” From the recent fallout between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell to tariff-related FUD and the upcoming CPI report, all roads lead back to rate expectations. The logic is simple: as Q1 unfolds, traders are pricing in rate cuts as a bullish catalyst for crypto, and with roughly $200 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, liquidity is stacking up for a potential risk-on rotation. Source: X However, smart money clearly splits on the outlook. On one side, $1.2 trillion BlackRock is calling for a 3% Fed rate cut. On the flip side, JPMorgan, the world’s largest bank, is hawkish, projecting no rate cuts “this year,” with other big players like Barclays backing that view. In fact, even Willy Woo has flagged a bearish outlook for crypto in 2026. Naturally, with volatility ramping up, Bitcoin [BTC] faces a test of its “safe-haven” status. The big question: Have traders already priced in this setup? Traditional assets are back in the spotlight, hitting fresh highs. Gold (XAU), for instance, topped $4,630 on the 12th of January, syncing with the growing macro FUD around crypto. According to AMBCrypto, the big question is, is this just a “coincidence” or an early warning for risk assets? Looking at 2025, this rotation doesn’t feel random. Gold closed the year with a 65% ROI, while BTC lagged at -6%. The result? The Bitcoin/Gold ratio has slipped to 20, meaning it now takes 20 ounces of gold to match one Bitcoin, down from 35 ounces at the start of the year. Source: LongTermTrends In essence, crypto FUD gave gold a boost in the 2025 cycle. Notably, the same pattern is playing out now. Gold and Silver are breaking into all-time highs “together.” Looking back at 2025, this kind of rotational move always lined up with stress building under the U.S. economy. Now, that’s where rate cuts come into play. With recent macro FUD flipping the market hawkish, the odds of a cut sit at just 5%. In this climate, the upcoming macro week is primed to put crypto under pressure, with Gold’s breakout acting as an “early” warning sign.

Title: Trump set to lead largest-ever US delegation to World Economic Forum in Davos next week

GENEVA (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will return to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting of business, political and cultural elites in Davos, Switzerland, next week, leading a record-large U.S. delegation, organizers said Tuesday. The Geneva-based think tank says Trump, whose assertive foreign policy on issues as diverse as Venezuela and Greenland in recent months has stirred concerns among U.S. friends and foes alike, will be accompanied by five Cabinet secretaries and other top officials for the event running from Monday through Jan. 23. A total of 850 CEOs and chairs of the world’s top companies will be among the 3,000 participants from 130 countries expected in the Alpine resort this year, the forum says. Forum President Borge Brende says six of the Group of Seven leaders — including Trump — will attend, as well as presidents Volodymyr Zelenskky of Ukraine, Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria and others. A total of 64 heads of state or government are expected so far — also a record — though that number could increase before the start of the event, he said. China’s delegation will be headed by Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing’s top trade official, Brende said. Among the scores of other high-profile attendees expected are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as well as tech industry titans Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Brende said the U.S. delegation will include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff. The forum, which held its first annual meeting in 1971, has long been a hub of dialogue, debate and deal-making. Trump has already attended twice while president, and was beamed in by video last year just days after being inaugurated for his second term. Critics call it a venue for the world’s elites to hobnob and do business that sometimes comes at the expense of workers, the impoverished or people on the margins of society. The forum counters that its stated goal is “improving the state of the world” and insists many advocacy groups, academics and cultural leaders have an important role too. This year’s edition will be the first annual meeting not headed by forum founder Klaus Schwab, who resigned last year. He’s been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of New York-based investment management company BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings.

Title: Trump criminal probe of Fed Chair Powell marks unprecedented escalation — and a warning to his successor

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank had been served by the Justice Department in connection with allegations related to congressional testimony on the renovation of the bank’s headquarters. (Credit: Federal Reserve) President Donald Trump's criminal probe targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell marks an extraordinary escalation in his battle with the central bank, sending a clear warning to the next Fed chair about the risks of defying the White House. Powell confirmed the Department of Justice investigation on Sunday evening in a video statement, calling the move "unprecedented" and another example of what he described as the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to intimidate the central bank. Powell's decision to respond so publicly, after days of private consultation with advisers, marked a sharp departure from the central banker's typically measured approach. TRUMP VS THE FEDERAL RESERVE: HOW THE CLASH REACHED UNCHARTED TERRITORY U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the Trump administration's criminal investigation in a video statement. (Al Drago/AFP/Getty Images) The probe focuses on whether Powell was truthful during congressional testimony about the project to overhaul the Fed's two main buildings on the National Mall. No charges have been filed, and Powell has denied any wrongdoing. The White House referred questions to the Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said Monday that her office proceeded with the probe after failing to receive a response from Powell, prompting prosecutors to initiate a legal process. "The United States Attorney’s Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman’s congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat," Pirro stated. "The word "indictment" has come out of Mr. Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach." Powell, widely viewed as one of the most crisis-tested Federal Reserve chairs in modern U.S. history, built his career as a lawyer and investment banker in New York before entering public service in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. He joined the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in 2012 and was tapped to lead the central bank in 2017. Now, a criminal investigation may represent the biggest test of Powell’s leadership, unfolding as Trump weighs his choice for the next Fed chair with Powell’s term set to expire in May. President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to tour the ongoing renovation. (Official White House photo by Daniel Torok) The next Fed chair would take on one of the most powerful economic jobs in the country, helping decide how expensive it is to borrow money for things like homes, cars and credit cards. Those decisions directly affect the cost of everyday living for Americans. FROM MORTGAGES TO CAR LOANS: HOW AFFORDABILITY RISES AND FALLS WITH THE FED Trump has narrowed his shortlist to four candidates as he approaches a final decision on leadership at the Fed: Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller and Rick Rieder. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been a loyal supporter of Trump's economic agenda. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Kevin Hassett is Trump’s top economic advisor and a loyal defender of the administration’s policies. He currently serves as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, and held two senior roles during Trump’s first term and advised the president on economic policy during the 2024 campaign. POWELL REVEALS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STEP DOWN FROM THE FED AS PRESSURE MOUNTS Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley banker, has emerged as a vocal critic of current Fed leadership, sharpening his attacks as he positioned himself as a potential replacement for Powell. He became the youngest person to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2006. Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, was long considered for Treasury Secretary before Trump ultimately tapped Scott Bessent. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller has repeatedly called for rate cuts, a move that aligns, in part, with Trump's demands. Of the candidates, he is considered the veteran academic of the group. He has also reiterated the importance of maintaining an independent Federal Reserve. And BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder is the last candidate to have an interview with Trump before the president makes his decision. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who did pre-interviews with all the candidates, said Trump is expected to announce his decision by the end of January.

As the investigation unfolds and a decision on the next Fed chair approaches, the episode underscores the growing political pressure surrounding a role long viewed as insulated from the White House.

Title: BlackRock to slash hundreds of jobs — latest Wall Street biz to kick off 2026 with firings

BlackRock is reportedly slashing hundreds of jobs across the company, making it the latest Wall Street giant to start the New Year with sweeping layoffs. The world’s largest asset manager plans to cut 250 jobs, or roughly 1% of its global headcount, across its investment and sales teams, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It’s unclear when the layoffs may take place or what is the driving force behind them, though rival banks and asset managers have linked job cuts at their own businesses to restructuring, cost-cutting, artificial intelligence and economic uncertainty. CitiGroup is set to axe about 1,000 jobs this week and UBS Group AG is planning a round of layoffs this month, with another round later this year, according to Bloomberg. A BlackRock spokesperson cast the company’s layoffs as a bid to become more efficient. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future.” Shares in the asset management firm – which recorded roughly $13.5 trillion in assets at the end of September – fell roughly 1% Tuesday. BlackRock declined to comment to The Post. The company, which has about 24,600 employees, led two rounds of layoffs last year, each time slashing roughly 1% of its workforce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been looking to lead the company deeper into alternative investments. The firm closed a $12 billion acquisition of alternative credit manager HPS Investment Partners in July. Since then, it has been integrating new executives and readying a new range of funds for investors. In its 2026 investment outlook, BlackRock said it will focus on investment themes such as artificial intelligence, income and diversification. “The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of equity exchange-traded funds, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” last week. “Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The firm still sees artificial intelligence as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle, and doesn’t believe it’s dying down anytime soon, Jacobs said. BlackRock is one of the few companies that offers specialized AI-focused funds, like its Tech Active ETF that has amassed more than $8 billion in assets. Income is another major focus this year because BlackRock expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates again, a move that would pressure yields on cash investments, Jacobs said. Diversification is the third focus in BlackRock’s annual report because investors are looking for new assets. “Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?” he told CNBC. “Something that’s going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.” The company is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: Franklin Templeton retrofits money market funds for tokenized stablecoin market

Time Published: 2026-01-13T14:00:00Z

Franklin Templeton is amending institutional money market funds to support stablecoin reserves and onchain cash use without launching new crypto-native products. Cointelegraph in your social feed Franklin Templeton has amended two Western Asset institutional money market funds (MMFs) to plug directly into the emerging US stablecoin regime and tokenized cash infrastructure rather than launching new crypto native products. According to a release shared with Cointelegraph, Franklin Templeton is adapting the two long‑running Western Asset institutional funds so they can be used more directly in US GENIUS‑aligned stablecoin reserve structures and blockchain‑enabled distribution channels, without changing their status as Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered 2a‑7 MMFs. The changes are designed to allow the funds to serve as regulated, government-backed collateral for payment stablecoins and other tokenized cash uses without altering their core regulatory status. ​Franklin Templeton’s Western Asset Institutional Treasury Obligations Fund (LUIXX) invests exclusively in short‑term US government obligations and is structured to be compatible with GENIUS Act reserve requirements, positioning it as plug‑and‑play infrastructure for payment stablecoin treasuries and bank‑style issuers that need SEC‑registered, government‑only collateral. Its Western Asset Institutional Treasury Reserves Fund (DIGXX), on the other hand, has added a blockchain‑enabled “Digital Institutional” share class on top of its existing 2a‑7 structure, intended to make it usable as 24/7, onchain collateral and cash management for tokenization platforms, custodians and broker‑dealers that want digital rails without moving into an unregistered vehicle. Related: XRP jumps 8% as Franklin Templeton, Grayscale ETFs begin trading Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, told Cointelegraph that the company expects stablecoin reserves to be managed “in both tokenized and more traditional form,” and sees room for both exclusive and multi‑manager mandates as more financial institutions launch their own tokens. He said that several “significant products in the stablecoin market” are “backed by traditional high-quality short-term issuance through non-digitally native product structures,” including the recently launched FRNT stablecoin in the State of Wyoming, and the company sees opportunities to help such partners through its investment management expertise. Franklin Templeton’s role, he said, is to manage reserves “in the product model [clients] prefer,” whether via bespoke portfolios or open‑end mutual funds. Bayston cast the amendments as incremental rather than experimental, noting that Western Asset’s institutional Treasury fund only needed “relatively minor adjustments” to sit inside the GENIUS framework and complement Franklin Templeton’s existing onchain products. In his view, many large clients still want familiar, SEC‑registered 2a‑7 wrappers as they plug into onchain distribution and collateral systems, so the company is extending a digital stack across a broader liquidity “suite” instead of forcing migration to new vehicles. Related: Franklin Templeton expands Benji tokenization platform to Canton Network ​Rather than tying the new digital share class to a single collateral or tokenization platform, Franklin Templeton plans to support access through multiple “trusted partners” as banks, broker‑dealers and other intermediaries roll out their own blockchain‑enabled frontends. Franklin Templeton is not alone in repositioning money funds for stablecoin reserves under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock announced plans to modify a Treasury money market fund in October 2025, aimed at serving as an authorized reserve asset for US stablecoin issuers, tightening its investment mandate to short‑dated Treasurys and overnight repo (short‑term, secured funding), to align with the new federal framework. BlackRock was already managing a bespoke government MMF for Circle’s USDC reserves, as large asset managers increasingly see regulated cash funds as backend rails for tokenized dollars rather than purely retail cash products.

Title: Acronis launches Archival Storage to give MSPs long-term, compliant data retention
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/13/acronis-launches-archival-storage-give-msps-long-term-compliant-data-retention/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T13:00:23Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 13 2026 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Archival Storage, a data storage and protection solution designed for managed service providers and their small to medium-sized business customers. Pitched as offering long-term, compliant and cost-efficient data storage and protection, Acronis Archival Storage allows users to retain large amounts of data securely, affordably and with fast accessibility when it matters most. Acronis Archival Storage has been built for compliance-driven and data-heavy environments and allows users to store infrequently accessed data with Amazon Web Services Inc. S3-compatible object storage, integrated directly into Acronis’ unified billing and management system. The company says the solution offers the reliability, durability and predictable pricing model MSPs need to meet customer demands and long-term retention requirements. “For many customers, regulations and industry best practices require data to be retained for years,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “With Acronis Archival Storage, MSPs can now provide their clients with long-term storage built for compliance readiness, cost predictability and ease of use.” Key features and benefits include S3-compatible object storage integrated with Acronis’ unified billing and management system to allow MSPs to manage archival data alongside other services from a single platform. The service delivers millisecond-level data retrieval with 11×9 durability and 99.5% availability, complemented with built-in encryption and write-once, read-many immutability that helps ensure data integrity and support regulatory compliance. The offering is designed to provide predictable total cost of ownership, with no egress or application programming interface fees to eliminate unexpected cloud charges and to complement existing warm backup storage in regulated environments. Acronis Archival Storage also emphasizes ease of deployment and ongoing management through preconfigured plans, S3 API support and integrated controls and is supported by seven globally distributed data centers to improve connectivity and meet regional compliance requirements. For MSPs, Acronis says, the new solution represents a new way to differentiate their offerings and build predictable margins through integrated billing and zero egress costs. By combining archival capabilities with Acronis’ robust cyber protection ecosystem, it says, service providers can deliver end-to-end data management that scales across customer needs, now with a cold storage tier. Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Davos to begin new era with global order shaken by Trump
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0113/1552872-davos-begins-new-era-with-global-order-shaken-by-trump/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T12:56:44Z
Full Content:
Business and political elites head to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week with its vision of a rules-based global economic order being tested to the limits. US President Donald Trump's expected appearance in the Swiss mountain resort highlights the gap between his agenda and the consensus-driven approach of the WEF, which has faced enduring criticism that it is a talking shop of the rich. His "America First" policy has led to trade tariffs being used as punishment, military intervention in Venezuela, the threat of taking over Greenland by force and a US retreat from cooperation on climate, health and other global challenges. The Trump administration has also threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment, prompting many top central bankers to issue a statement defending him and central bank independence. Dubbing its 56th edition "A Spirit of Dialogue", the WEF's leaders say that given the current uncertainty, getting together to map out a way forward in business and politics is crucial. "Dialogue is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said WEF president and CEO Borge Brende, a former Norwegian minister. But others say that with the US and China leveraging power to suit national interests, the WEF risks obsolescence. "Who is going to be making the case for the rules-based international order?" said Daniel Woker, a former Swiss ambassador and foreign relations expert. "To be very blunt, in a system where everyone is only looking out for themselves, it has no reason to exist. It's an event from the past." Davos-watchers are also looking at whether the event has lost impetus since its 87-year-old founder Klaus Schwab stepped down as chair in April. The Geneva-based organisation said in August an internal investigation had found no evidence of material wrongdoing by Schwab, after a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. It named BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs. The latest forum has much to discuss, from how to handle Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine establishing US supremacy in the Western hemisphere, to the ways artificial intelligence is changing the world. It comes just after one of Switzerland's worst modern tragedies, a ski resort bar fire that killed 40 people. In pre-event briefings, the WEF has put a brave face on the global tumult, highlighting how companies have sought to adapt to the highest U.S. tariff rates since the Great Depression and pointing to an easing of trade tensions in late 2025. Still, a WEF survey of executives released last week showed that doing business got harder in 2025. The poll also painted a downbeat picture of cooperation on peace and security. With several European leaders expected to attend, eyes will be on how they respond to US challenges, including Trump's threats to take over Greenland, and attacks on European efforts to regulate American tech firms. "The politicians need to stand strong," said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of the UNI Global Union representing 20 million service-sector workers worldwide, urging policymakers to address how AI and new technologies impact jobs. One feature of this year's WEF meeting will be top oil executives eager to hear Trump promoting his energy dominance agenda, which encourages them to drill for more oil and gas while snubbing alternatives like wind and solar. The CEOs of Exxon Mobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor and ENI are all expected after much more sporadic attendance in past years, when oil players saw the forum as anti-fossil fuel. It remains to be seen whether China, which in recent years has sent top officials, will field a sizeable Davos presence. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026.

LAST UPDATE | 13 Jan IRISH DIPLOMATS HAVE postponed an accreditation ceremony for the new Iranian ambassador to Ireland in response to the deaths of pro-democracy protestors. Iran has an embassy in Blackrock in Dublin and its new chief diplomat, Eshagh Al Habib, was due to go to Áras an Uachtaráin for a ceremony to accept his credentials. This has been postponed, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, in response to the deaths and injuries of people killed in protests and the shutting down of the internet and phones in the country by the regime. Speaking to reporters in Egypt today during a tour of the Middle East, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee said she didn’t think “it was appropriate” for the ceremony to proceed today. “We’re appalled and I’m appalled by what’s happening in Iran, and I don’t think it was appropriate for that to proceed today,” she said. “We need to keep diplomatic ties open, and we will, but I think it was the right thing to do today.” Iran has been gripped by pro-democracy protests in recent weeks – hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in the uprising against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s rule. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher. The protests in Iran began in late December over the ailing economy and have transformed into the most significant challenge to the regime for several years. McEntee said today there is a small Irish team on the ground in Iran. “We’re engaged with them on a regular basis,” she said, adding that contact between the team and the Department of Foreign Affairs is “very difficult” due to communications restrictions in Iran. “I don’t fear for their safety, but we do need to keep in contact with them,” she said. Advertisement Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin condemned the regime’s attacks on protestors and said the violence in Iran “must stop”. “I strongly condemn the brutal and violent suppression of protestors that has left hundreds of civilians dead in Iran over recent days,” he said in a statement on X. “The people of Iran have a fundamental right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. The repression must end. I urge the authorities in Tehran to uphold the rights of all their citizens. “The violence must stop, the curtailing of basic freedoms must end, and dialogue begin at once.” On Sunday, McEntee said she was “deeply concerned” by developments in Iran. This morning the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the postponement of the formal ceremony to welcome the new ambassador. “The decision to postpone the ceremony of credentials for the Ambassador-designate of the Islamic Republic of Iran was taken in light of protests in Iran in recent days which have seen very significant numbers of Iranians killed or injured and a communications blackout,” a spokeswoman said. In a statement yesterday, the Iranian regime’s embassy in Dublin has claimed the Tehran Government is open to dialogue, committed to human rights and “peaceful assembly”. The Journal has requested a statement from the Iranian embassy in regard to today’s development. UK Diplomatic measures have also been taken in the UK, with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper telling the House of Commons today that her department had summoned the Iranian ambassador. Cooper said she had spoken to the Iranian foreign minister yesterday, “setting out the UK’s total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing”. The Foreign Secretary said: “Today, as the further reports have come through, the minister for the Middle East (Hamish Falconer) at my instruction has summoned the Iranian ambassador to underline the gravity of this moment, and to call Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing.” With additional reporting from Eimer McAuley Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo LONDON, Jan 13 : BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, still believes in the investment case for artificial intelligence in the year ahead but will be focusing on broader opportunities, it said on Tuesday. Investors seeking to play the AI theme into 2026 favour energy and infrastructure providers over Wall Street big tech, BlackRock said in its Investment Directions report, citing a recent investor survey it conducted. AI and big tech dominated markets and world equity returns in 2025, but as the multitrillion-dollar race between the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet to build new data centres generates worries about uncertain returns on capital and higher borrowing, investors were looking for new ideas, the BlackRock survey showed. Among the 732 companies in BlackRock's survey of clients based in the EMEA region, only a fifth said that the largest U.S. tech groups represented the most compelling investment opportunity in AI.

Title: Layoffs news: Meta, BlackRock, Citigroup to fire hundreds of employees — and it's just the first month of 2026

Layoffs in 2026: At least three large companies have announced mass layoffs in the recent days, and January is not even over yet. The job loss trend that gripped 2025 seems to have entered 2026 too — at least for now — with giants like Meta, Citi Group and BlackRock laying off thousands of staff across roles. The BlackRock layoffs were the most recent job cuts announced by a major company in this month, with the firm announcing that it will let go hundreds of employees. Here is a list of major companies across the world that have announced layoffs in 2026 — Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in the company's Reality Labs sector as it plans to restructure to put more money into AI, Bloomberg reported. As per the report quoting a person familiar with the development, the Meta job cuts are expected later this week as the company wants to shift money away from some virtual reality products and into other AI wearables. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg had asked company executives to look for budget reductions within the Reality Labs. Banking major Citigroup is about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company. The Wall Street bank had around 227,000 employees at the end of September as per data shared by it. The latest round of layoffs at Citigroup comes as part of the company's plan announced two years ago to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, as per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know. “We will continue to reduce our headcount in 2026,” Citigroup said in a statement. “These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work,” it added. Under Fraser, who took over as CEO in 2021, Citigroup has seen a company-wide revamp where it exited much of its international retail business and restructured its core operations. BlackRock on Monday said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, becoming the latest Wall Street firm to announce job cuts. As per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know, the BlackRock layoffs will see around 1% of its workforce being let go, translating to around 250 employees across divisions. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority. Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future,” a BlackRock spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. The move comes as the CEO of the world's largest asset management company pushes for alternative investments.
