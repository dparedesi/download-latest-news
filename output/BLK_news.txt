The One in Four charity, which supports survivors of child sex abuse, saw more men than women come forward last year, for the first time in its more than 20-year history. In what was also its busiest year, the proportion of male survivors reached a “historic high” – a development the charity puts down to the aftermath of the Blackrock Boys radio documentary, which detailed historic sexual abuse of two brothers, Mark and David Ryan, at Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It led to the establishment of a scoping inquiry into abuse in religious-run schools and, this year, a commission of investigation. Its work is ongoing. The charity’s 2024 annual report, published on Monday, notes the 14 per cent increase in the proportion of male survivors – from 48 per cent of all contacts in 2023 to 62 per cent – and that this increase coincided with the Government’s publication of the Scoping Inquiry Report into Historical Sexual Abuse in Schools. “Contacts to the service increased by 17 per cent, with 7,674 support sessions delivered to 1,292 individuals. Advocacy support requests rose by 21 per cent,” says the report. “The percentage of male survivors coming forward reached a historic high, climbing to 62 per cent from 48 per cent [in 2023].” One in Four chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the trend indicated that when the State “talks honestly about child sexual abuse and demonstrates that survivors will be heard, people respond. “The public conversation and the visibility of the scoping inquiry have helped create an environment in which survivors – especially men – felt able to come forward and seek support.” In all, the charity delivered almost 8,000 sessions of support to 1,292 people. Nearly half (44 per cent) were living in Dublin, with 45 per cent in the rest of Ireland and the remaining abroad or unknown. More than half were men (62 per cent), with 37 per cent women and 1 per cent non-binary. “These numbers represent not just statistics, but real people breaking years, sometimes decades, of silence,” said Ms Kenny. In July last year, the Government published the report of the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders. Its primary recommendation, that a commission of investigation be established, was accepted by the Government. It appointed Mr Justice Michael MacGrath to chair the commission which will examine the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse all primary and post-primary schools. Ms Kenny said the commission would “play a crucial role in examining decades of child sexual abuse in schools and uncovering the lessons of our past”.

'트럼프'는 하마스에 가자 지구 민간인에 대한 '살상'을 중단하고 무장해제를 '요구'했습니다. '최소 12구' 중 10구째 인질 '시신 1구'를 '이스라엘'에 보낸 '하마스' 관계자는 '무장해제' 약속을 '할 수 없다'고 했습니다.

Title: Will Japan’s banks soon invest in Bitcoin? FSA weighs major reform

Japan’s crypto adoption exploded 120% in 2025 amid positive policy shift. The interest in digital assets has grown, especially in Japan. Per Chainalysis, Japan topped the 2025 adoption list with a 120% crypto user growth. Japan may be gearing up for a major overhaul to drive crypto adoption. The country’s regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), is considering allowing banks to hold crypto assets like Bitcoin [BTC] as investments, according to a Livedoor report. In recent years, the cryptocurrency market has grown massively, with the U.S leading in institutional adoption via ETFs. The crypto holdings of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently crossed $100 billion. Other banks and investment firms like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley allow wealthy clients to have crypto exposure in the U.S. In July, Standard Chartered also made a similar move for its U.K. customers, starting with BTC and Ethereum [ETH]. At that time, the banking giant said there was “growing interest in regulated digital asset solutions.” To achieve and catch up with its counterparts in the U.S, Japan seeks to expand its regulatory clarity to allow crypto in banking investments. Per Livedoor, a working group under the Prime Minister is set to discuss the new guidelines to allow banks to act as crypto exchanges. Given crypto’s volatility, the risk mitigation system for banks will also be explored to ensure the safety of the institutions. In June, the FSA proposed a reclassification of crypto assets into “financial products” to pave the way for crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds). It is the same framework that applies to securities and other traditional financial products in Japan. Pundits also highlighted that the move would slash crypto taxes from over 50% to 20%. Given the similar treatment as traditional stocks, the country also banned crypto insider trading with new rules. Collectively, the recent updates have been geared towards ensuring user protections and further adoption. In fact, Chainalysis’s report singled out Japan as the fastest-growing crypto market across the broader Asia-Pacific region in 2025. It saw a 120% crypto market growth thanks to regulatory shifts, with Ripple [XRP] as the dominant crypto asset. Indonesia, South Korea, and India followed closely at 103%, 100% and 99% growth rates. Source: Chainalysis As of early 2025, there were about 12 million new crypto accounts in Japan, a 3.5X surge from five years ago.

Title: BlackRock to Develop Tokenization Tech as Bitcoin ETF Passes $100 Billion in Assets

BlackRock is developing technology to tokenize a wide range of assets and expand its digital investment offerings. BlackRock is developing its own technology to tokenize a broad range of assets, from real estate to equities and bonds. CEO Larry Fink said the global market currently holds more than $4.5 trillion in digital wallets, spanning crypto, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. “A lot of that money is outside the United States,” Fink said on CNBC earlier today, emphasizing the opportunity for the firm to reach new investors through digital channels. Fink said tokenization could allow investors who are entering markets through crypto to access more traditional long-term products, such as retirement funds. “If we could tokenize an ETF, we could get them into the more traditional long-term retirement products,” he said, pointing to BlackRock’s digital platforms, which include tokenized money market funds and Bitcoin investments that have grown to over $100 billion. Fink also said yesterday that Bitcoin and crypto “serve same purpose as gold.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, launched just 21 months ago, is BlackRock’s most profitable fund — outranking even products that have been in circulation for more than two decades. The firm’s growth extends beyond digital assets. Fink highlighted record inflows across ETFs, private markets, AI-driven equity strategies, and investment technology platforms. “It wasn’t just one product area. It was not just one region. It was a completeness,” he said, noting the breadth of BlackRock’s growth across business lines. Fink credited the firm’s strategy of combining active and passive management, public and private markets, and technology overlays for driving this expansion. Fink also stressed the value of long-term investing in his chat: “It’s not about if our market’s going up or down, is there a bubble in crypto or technology. It’s about being in the market throughout the cycle,” he said. He underscored the power of compounding over decades, noting that even a small additional return can significantly grow a retirement portfolio over a 30-year horizon. Looking ahead, Fink said regulatory clarity in the U.S. and further investment in digital asset innovation will be critical to supporting market growth. “We’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets,” he said. The firm expects that over the coming decades, tokenized financial products will allow investors to remain within a digital ecosystem while accessing the full spectrum of traditional and alternative investments.

October 19, 2025 13:44 ET | Source: NB HASH NB HASH London, United Kingdom, Oct. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As inflation persists and global interest rates continue to fall, institutional capital is searching for a new destination that offers both stability and yield.This month, investment giant BlackRock made headlines by expanding its exposure to Real-World Assets (RWA) — a move that many analysts see as the clearest sign yet that real-asset tokenization has entered the mainstream.While large institutions are beginning to capitalize on this opportunity, NB HASH is taking it a step further — opening the door for everyday investors to participate in the same asset-backed yield strategies that Wall Street is now chasing. From Institutions to Individuals: The Rise of RWA RWA (Real-World Assets) refers to the tokenization of tangible, income-producing assets — such as energy facilities, infrastructure capacity, or data-center power — and bringing those assets onto the blockchain.Unlike traditional crypto speculation, RWA projects are tied directly to real economic output, creating stable, transparent, and verifiable income.NB HASH leverages this model by linking its investment ecosystem to audited real-world resources including: “RWA is no longer a concept reserved for institutions,” said an NB HASH spokesperson.“We make it possible for anyone with USDT to participate in assets that produce real-world cash flow — not just speculative value.” Illustrative Earning Scenarios NB HASH’s RWA products are structured around verified real-asset performance. Returns are calculated and distributed through on-chain smart contracts, ensuring transparency and traceability. Figures shown are for illustration only and do not constitute a guarantee of return. Actual performance may vary based on market and project factors. Why Now — and Why RWA Matters Analysts from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock alike point to the same macro backdrop driving this shift: As a result, RWA has emerged as the bridge between traditional finance and digital value, and NB HASH is among the first platforms to offer it to the public with full transparency and daily on-chain settlement. Transparency and Security at the Core All NB HASH RWA projects undergo independent third-party audits to verify asset ownership and revenue generation.Smart contracts automatically handle profit distribution, and users can track earnings in real time on the blockchain.The platform supports 24/7 operations and multilingual customer service, ensuring security and accessibility for a global user base.

Title: Sarsfields ease past Midleton to regain Cork crown

RTÉ Sport contributor Sarsfields 2-18 Midleton 1-14 Sarsfields lifted their second Co-op SuperStores Premier Senior Hurling Championship title in three seasons following a seven-point victory over Midleton at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh. The Riverstown-based club made light work of their divisional rivals with player of the match Jack O'Connor hitting 0-05 and James Sweeney getting two goals. The result adds another chapter into the story being written by management duo Johnny Crowley and Diarmuid O’Sullivan, and it follows success in last year’s Munster championship and three consecutive Cork league titles. It felt like business as usual for the club and their reward was a comfortable 1-09 to 1-03 advantage at the interval. Midleton were missing Conor Lehane and Eoin Moloney, two important components in the team that reached the final via victories over Glen Rovers and Blackrock. Clinical finish from James Sweeney after being set up by Cian Darcy as @SarsfieldsCork register their first green flag in the @OfficialCorkGAA final #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/NGuG8EC15k The Magpies only led once, through an Evan McGrath green flag at the City End in the 10th minute after a mistake by the Sars back-line presented the midfielder with an open goal. That made the scoreboard read 1-00 to 0-02 and the soon to be champions immediately went back in front through a brace of Colm McCarthy frees. O’Connor then got in on the action, just before Sweeney rifled the back of the net with a blistering strike after collecting a pass from Cian Darcy. That made it 1-05 to 1-00 and the first half finished with a burst by Midleton that wasn’t enough to dent Sars’ lead or confidence. The game restarted with O’Connor splitting the posts and McCarthy getting his seventh, as their overall lead grew to 1-11 to 1-03. Full-time: @SarsfieldsCork 2-18 @MidletonGaa 1-14 James Sweeney slips home his second goal to ensure that Sarsfields regain the @OfficialCorkGAA senior hurling title, the eighth in their history #rtegaa #sundaygame pic.twitter.com/dJC2GQm8W4 The Magpies did make of a game of it in the end, by bringing it back to four points as more and more black and white jerseys began finding space. This started with a burst that involved Mikey Finn nailing a free and a 45, in addition to Killian McDermott sneaking the sliotar over from the tightest of angles. Then came a goal chance at the near post from Alex Quirke and this was scrambled off the line by Sars. A green flag would have made it a two point game, instead it galvanised the eventual champions as they came through the next 20 minutes without a scratch from their divisional rivals. Even when Midleton got it back to four at 1-13 to 1-09, they remained in control and saw out the game with O’Connor scoring three points from play. Sweeney rounded out the win in the dying seconds with a close range goal after escaping his marker at the City End. Sarsfields: Ben Graham; Conor O’Sullivan, Cillian Roche, Donal English; Bryan Murphy, Luke Elliott, Craig Leahy; Daniel Hogan (0-1), Killian Murphy (0-1); Jack O’Connor (0-5), Colm McCarthy (0-8, 7f), Cian Darcy (0-1); Daniel Kearney, James Sweeney (2-0), Barry O’Flynn (0-1).

Title: Sunday Summary: Marc Holliday Is Not Playing Around

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy SL Green Realty’s earnings call last week was pretty good. The largest office owner in New York City saw cash flow increase ($164.4 million versus $155.9 million the previous quarter). They scored profitable sales. And leasing was downright great —Teneo Holdings, the global consulting firm, took 46,551 square feet at 280 Park Avenue, and asset management firm Sagard Capital Partners added 31,580 square feet to its previous 8,936 square feet at the same address; at One Madison Avenue, SL Green leased the sixth floor (92,663 square feet) to Harvey AI Corporation; and over at the Lipstick Building (885 Third Avenue) the law firm Fox Horan & Camerini signed a 19,200-square-foot lease. All very good. But the thing that most caught our attention was the big continuation bet CEO Marc Holliday just put on Midtown the day before the call: $730 million on 65 East 55th Street (aka Park Avenue Tower), which the REIT is buying from Blackstone. A month earlier, Holliday scooped up 346 Madison Avenue — the former home of Brooks Brothers — and 11 East 44th Street from Claudio Del Vecchio for $160 million. On the call, Holliday gave a sense of what SL Green has planned. “Over the past five years, we saw the heightened demand for well-located Park Avenue and Grand Central assets long before the competition, and now it’s truly paying off,” Holliday said. “Earlier in the quarter, we delivered on our goal of identifying a major new development site, acquiring 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th across the street from One Vanderbilt. This is the perfect place to build the next great building.” Hopefully this can make up for losing out on SL Green’s proposed casino in Times Square — although this might have been a blessing in disguise for the real estate giant. A firm further along in the bidding process for a downstate gaming license, MGM Empire City, looked at the numbers for a Yonkers casino and said, “Thanks, but no thanks.” And, maybe it’s just us, but we’re seeing a pattern. The major developers and tenants are betting big on the Plaza District. BXP found an anchor for its $2 billion, 930,000-square-foot 343 Madison Avenue: The insurance and investment giant C.V. Starr, which is taking about 30 percent of the unbuilt tower. And fashion deity Prada is getting pretty ambitious with its plans for 720-724 Fifth Avenue — they’re currently finishing up talks with Related Companies to build a skyscraper on the prime spot. A few other sites are wooing tenants and, given the fact that new office construction ground to a halt during the pandemic, these sites are actually poised to do extremely well. Not everyone wants to talk about office By sheer numbers, the deal of the week has to be the dizzying, $40 billion bet that is being organized by BlackRock — and includes firms NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX — for Aligned Data Centers, which consists of about 50 data center campuses globally (with a lot more on the way) to cater to AI mania. And that’s hardly the only big asset bet last week. Whatever anyone thinks about the hospitality market, Cain is seeing the value of the the Dominick Hotel at SoHo’s 246 Spring Street, having plunked down $175 million for the 390-key lodging, which will be reopened as a Delano hotel. Speaking of Cain, they’ve also been planning a lush new park as part of the multibillion-dollar One Beverly Hills in Southern California. This is notable because parks are an increasingly rarefied amenity, with an average of 6,000 acres of open space going bye-bye throughout the country every single day. (Sheesh! When did fresh air and grass become luxuries?) “Land is a finite resource, and it’s an incredibly important one for our cities and communities, and there are a lot of pressures on how we use that land,” said Bianca Clarke of the Trust for Public Land. “The problem is, if we use land for uses other than public spaces, it’s really difficult then to create public spaces where we need them.” The building of parks has fallen increasingly on developers, with private developers accounting for 67 percent of the park and greenway space in 10 major cities in the country. Housing, housing, housing! But the asset we want to talk about most this week is not hospitality, data centers or office. It’s housing. Part of the reason is because of the activity: the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) plunked down $49.7 million for the 154-unit Emerald Apartments in Downtown L.A.; Crescent Heights nabbed a $238.4 million refinancing for Forma, its 40-story, 588-unit luxury tower in Miami’s Edgewater (which comes with a Whole Foods to boot!); and the Miami-based Resident Group secured a $113.8 million refinancing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for a 32-story, 279-unit luxury tower, also in Edgewater (honestly, we didn’t know HUD backed luxury housing). And we would be lax if we failed to mention that Midtown Park, the $2 billion mixed-use project in Miami from Rosso Development, Midtown Development and Proper Hospitality, got approval last week from the Urban Development Review Board to begin construction. However, the reason we’re most excited about housing this week is that CO dropped its first ever Power Residential list on Tuesday. The list represents our selections for the 35 most important names in residential real estate throughout the country. Some are developers who have quietly built tens of thousands of houses and apartment buildings. Others are brokers who moved billions of dollars worth of luxury condos. There are architects, lawyers and reality TV stars among their number. Take a leisurely look through it. See you next week! Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Chimes in on Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle Discourse
URL: https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-chimes-in-on-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-discourse/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T09:33:31Z
Full Content:
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes the long-standing idea of Bitcoin’s four-year market cycle may soon become obsolete. In an interview with CNBC, Hoskinson argued that as institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity deepen their involvement in the market, Bitcoin’s historical rhythm of boom-and-bust tied to halving events could fade away. For more than a decade, Bitcoin’s price action has followed a familiar four-year pattern, rising sharply after each halving, reaching new highs, and then retracing by as much as 85% before stabilizing. Hoskinson suggested that this predictable pattern no longer fits the realities of a maturing market. “I don’t think we’re gonna see those kinds of cycles anymore because there is too much money in the space and there is too much market structure,” he said, adding that complex financial products like synthetics and derivatives will dampen volatility. According to Hoskinson, the inflow of institutional capital will create “stronger floors and less volatility,” gradually pushing Bitcoin toward more stable price behavior. He also predicted that this stability will play a crucial role in onboarding the next half a billion users to crypto, with regulatory developments and risk-managed products reinforcing investor confidence. Despite his skepticism about Bitcoin’s four-year rhythm, Hoskinson believes altcoin seasons will persist. He recalled how the last cycle revolved around the search for an “Ethereum killer,” spawning projects like Solana and Polkadot. In the next phase, he expects privacy-oriented platforms to take center stage, highlighting Cardano’s own Midnight project, which he says addresses issues such as oracles and stablecoins while strengthening the Cardano ecosystem. Analysts like João Wedson, Alphractal CEO and verified CryptoQuant analyst, argue that the four-year fractal cycle remains intact, pointing to Bitcoin’s recent market behavior as proof. Others, like popular investor Ted Pillows, believe the absence of a euphoric blow-off top this time signals an evolving, liquidity-driven market that could see Bitcoin extend its rally into 2026.

Title: Crypto Market Players are Anticipating These 4 Bullish Events, Here’s Why

The crypto market is entering a potentially decisive phase as investors track four developments that could shape sentiment for the rest of 2025. Experts anticipate a possible end to the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign and a wave of pending ETF decisions that could widen institutional access to digital assets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested this week that the central bank’s balance sheet runoff, known as quantitative tightening, may be nearing its conclusion. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics conference, Powell noted that bank reserves were approaching an ample level, hinting that quantitative tightening could end in the coming months. Markets interpreted the comments as a sign that liquidity conditions could soon ease, a scenario historically supportive for risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Adding to the optimism, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reaffirmed the likelihood of two interest rate cuts before the end of 2025, saying the labor market’s slowdown justifies a gradual policy pivot. Investors view such a shift as a green light for growth sectors. “When the Fed begins an easing cycle, bonds in the middle of the curve, around three to seven years, often strike the right balance of income and protection,” said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, Chief Investment and Portfolio Strategist Americas at BlackRock. Another major catalyst looms on the regulatory front. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission faces final deadlines this month for 16 crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), covering tokens such as Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart and ETF Store president Nate Geraci have called October a make-or-break period for the sector, with approval of even a handful of products expected to unlock fresh institutional inflows. Together, the potential end of quantitative tightening, prospects of rate cuts, and mounting anticipation over ETF approvals are forming a rare alignment of bullish factors for digital assets. As industry analyst Lark Davis put it, you might be missing what’s coming next if you “still think the crypto market has topped.”

Title: Spiritan survivor calls for swifter redress and apology

Ailbhe Conneely Social Affairs & Religion Correspondent "I feel very empty, very raw, I'm missing him terribly." The words of David Ryan when asked how he is feeling following the second anniversary of his late brother Mark. "Two years on, it hits more, and while I’m more grounded, it’s poignant that he’s gone two years," he says. David and Mark Ryan were catapulted into the spotlight three years ago following the broadcast of RTÉ’s Doc on One programme 'Blackrock Boys’. The brothers spoke publicly about the sexual abuse they suffered as boys on the campus of Blackrock College in Dublin run by the Spiritan Order. Their bravery and the manner in which they told their story resulted in former students contacting RTÉ’s Liveline programme, alleging historical physical and sexual abuse. It all snowballed into hundreds of cases of alleged abuse being reported to gardaí as well as to the organisation One in Four - which supports survivors of child sexual abuse. Fr Martin Kelly offered a public apology to all victims and survivors on behalf of the Spiritan congregation, and independent experts were brought in by the order to guide survivors through a restorative justice programme. The Spiritan Restorative Justice Framework has six elements including an apology, therapy, testimony (truth telling), redress, memorialisation and restorative justice. Just half of those have been activated in full, according to a group which represents some of the victims/survivors called Restore Together. "Dragging its heels" Outstanding issues include redress, over which; the Order has been accused of "dragging its heels". Just over a week ago, the Spiritans denied deliberately delaying or obstructing the progress on a redress scheme. It confirmed that Rockwell Farm, (at Rockwell College in Co Tipperary), would be the first of the properties to be sold. It has been put on the market with an asking price of €21m, a sum which is "only the tip of the iceberg", according to David Ryan. Speaking from his home, Mr Ryan questioned the length of time it would take for the Order to untie itself from assets, to provide redress to survivors. "We’re three years since the Doc on One, what’s happened in three years? Very little." Since ‘Blackrock Boys’ aired in November 2022, David Ryan has twice been bereaved. The unexpected death of Mark in September 2023 received national attention. More recently, the death of David’s mother has focused his mind on the fleeting nature of life. He acknowledges the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into the Handling of Historical Child Sexual Abuse in Schools as a step, however there’s concern over the length of time it could take. "He (Judge Michael McGrath) will need to go through lots of reports, police statements and judging by how many victims/survivors that came forward through the Scoping Inquiry, and more are expected, it could be a long-drawn-out process which will frustrate people." There are reports that the commission could take five years, which, according to Mr Ryan, "is just way too long; survivors will be dead". "Lack of apology" A significant grievance of the now 61-year-old is a "lack of an apology" from the Taoiseach, which he called for in September 2024. Simon Harris TD who held the position at the time said he could not see a scenario where there would not be a State apology. Mr Ryan has been waiting to hear from Taoiseach Micheál Martin since he took up his role and is much aggrieved over the lack of an apology to victims and survivors. For two decades One In Four has supported David Ryan and tomorrow will launch its 2024 annual report. The announcement of the Scoping Inquiry in 2023 led to an increase in waiting lists for treatment and therapy from the organisation. It is likely that more victims/survivors sought help from the organisation last year, due to the publication of Mary O'Toole's report which found almost 2,400 allegations of sexual abuse in respect of 308 schools recorded by religious orders that ran the schools. When he first approached One in Four twenty years ago, David Ryan’s "head was on the ground". Such was the level of abuse and trauma he had endured; Mr Ryan would not attend a public bathroom, stay in a hotel, or go to a pool. He still can’t attend an indoor swimming pool, but with significant therapy in recent years he can use outdoor swimming areas. Through therapy and support, he acknowledges "he’s a different person now". He describes it as being "deprogrammed", requiring huge work on his part - reliving the abuse, playing it back and flashbacks. "I don’t blame myself any longer, it wasn’t my fault and looking back on it, they were the sick people, not me. "It’s only in the last year really that I'm accepting what happened to me."

Title: Stephen Donnelly swoops to the rescue of UK healthcare citing his triumphs in Ireland

Unemployment has sent good hardworking Irish people on the boat to seek their fortune in Britain for centuries now, and it’s no different for former minister for health Stephen Donnelly, who will be rolling up his sleeves with CF, a healthcare management consultant. Quite how the UK, home of the world’s first modern universal free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare system, wound up requiring expertise from Ireland, home of it costing €60 to have a doctor tell you to keep an eye on it, is a contemplation for another day. CF spared no fireworks in their announcement of the former Fianna Fáil brainiac who was punted unceremoniously to touch by the people of Wicklow last year. Unappreciated by the hill tribes of Delgany and Roundwood, he “designed and led the most comprehensive programme of investment and reform in Ireland’s public health services in decades”, said the announcement. “Stephen brings something truly unique to our UK transformation work – direct experience designing and implementing the exact type of comprehensive national health system reform that the UK government is now prioritising,” said Hannah Farrar, chief executive of CF. He’ll help the company be consulted in the UK, where the cracks in society are growing wider and ministers can offer only words like “we will harness AI” to fill them. He will also work on expanding the business across Europe and the Middle East, where reforms are also in the offing. “Some years ago I left healthcare consulting in the UK to enter parliament in Ireland,” said Donnelly in his announcement on LinkedIn, somewhat minimising his 13 years in the Dáil including a spell as founder/ co-leader of the Social Democrats and five years as minister for health. “While there is still much to be done, crucial improvements were achieved,” he said, slipping comfortably back into the metrical worldview of the business-wonk, listing his achievements as follows: “a 60 per cent reduction in long waiters; a 50 per cent reduction in outpatient and 30 per cent reduction in surgical waiting times; a shift of care from hospitals to the community; an end to falling productivity; vital new patient services including a transformation of women’s health services; a new eHealth plan; a step change in public health and preventative care; rebalancing the regional deployment of health assets.” Sounds like a record of delivery that could be of interest to the Health Service Executive (HSE), which is already regularly spending more than €100 million a year on external consultants, many of whom have never even been minister for health. The youth of Ireland can rest easy: they have an ally in Frank McDonald, former Irish Times environment editor and author of several books about Dublin’s transformation into a kip. The renowned critic joined Labour, Green and Independent councillors in a judicial review of the Government’s planned changes to apartment standards, characterised by the group as a “developer-led race to the bottom”. He filed an affidavit outlining his bona fides (various books, various honours), his shock at the manner of the plans being introduced (“I was aghast”) and his proposed remedy (quash the plans, do an environmental assessment). McDonald, the inadequately housed will be happy to hear, recently “moved out to Blackrock” where he lives in a “spacious new apartment on the top floor of a three-storey block”. It boasts “views south towards Three Rock Mountain”, he told the High Court, calling up what a High Court judge might consider a familiar and aesthetically appealing vista. “I could spend my time reading novels and drinking champagne on our planted terrace,” he went on, no doubt sparking serious interest from judges at this stage. [ Is Ireland ready for drab Soviet-style apartment blocks?Opens in new window ] But no – he has chosen to fight for the younger generation, whose “plight will be aggravated by the dystopian future set out for them by the new apartment design standards referred to above, which effectively guarantee that they will have no option but to pay dearly for Lilliputian living spaces in glorified 21st-century tenements”. So, like Bruce Wayne before him, he has set the champagne aside and joined the fight. The Government, extremely annoyed by all this, says it plans to fight back “robustly”. The youth could use such a champion when it comes to “deemed disposal”, Brian Cowen’s tax on unrealised investment gains that is felt as a deep injustice by the type of person who has unrealised investment gains. Gen Z worldwide is interested in stocks and shares, having come of financial age during a long period where the lines have been heading in the right direction and their capital, while at risk, goes up rather than down. Irish dabblers might start out following US advice, before encountering decidedly un-free market taxes taking a bite out of their profits. Last week, in the hotbed of radical political thought that is “r/irishpersonalfinance”, the savings-and-investments subforum of social media network Irish Reddit, a user popped up with a plan: a national walkout to end deemed disposal. [ How Gen Z is taking a different approach to money - and what others can learn from itOpens in new window ] “This Monday, at 2pm, we walk out of our schools, colleges and places of work,” the user wrote, in a hint at his youth, “demanding change”. “For too long, the ruling coalition has ruled by diktat, without the slightest thought toward the preferences of the electorate,” quoth the rabble-rouser with a touch of (James) Connolly to his rhetoric. “A people shouldn’t acquiesce to their government, the government should follow the will of the people.” Monday, October 13th, came and went, and despite the poster’s claim that he had the support of “the rest of my placement cohort at the Big Four consulting company I work at”, Bastilles went unstormed and the fetters on free enterprise remained in place. One to keep an eye on though. If this keeps up, the Progressive Democrats might spontaneously reappear. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: David McCullagh: ‘There’s plenty of people in the long grass hoping I’ll fall flat on my face’

David McCullagh says it’s definitely time for him to move to radio. “In the space of a week before the summer, women approached me at random on two separate occasions and told me I looked much better on telly.” One of these unsolicited verdicts on his real-life appearance was delivered just outside the RTÉ campus in Montrose, Dublin. “I went in and told the make-up department. They were delighted,” he says. As I meet the journalist, presenter and historian (57) in a hotel lounge not far from Montrose, he’s limbering up to swap the Six One television news for Radio 1’s Today with David McCullagh – and poised to publish his latest book, From Crown to Harp. Completed with the aid of a “really, really handy bout of insomnia”, the book covers the 28-year period in which the Anglo-Irish Treaty was undone, with McCullagh exploring three decades of fractious negotiations and much-contested shifts in symbolism. He cites an October 1921 cartoon in British satirical magazine Punch in which an Irish nationalist, asking if the inn he finds himself in is the Harp, is told it’s the Crown and Harp. “But I don’t think you’ll find it any less comfortable for that,” the innkeeper replies. “It sort of encapsulates the British attitude of ‘all we’re asking you, all we’re asking you, is to give us our symbol, and it will have no practical difference. And to an extent that was true, to an extent they were lying through their teeth.” Evolving expressions of identity from stamps, coins and passports to flags and anthems are covered, though especially fun to consider now are the diplomatic exchanges over recognition of the Irish president in official toasts. “It seems kind of arcane and not worth bothering about, but if you feel you’re in a position of inferiority and you want to assert your independence, sovereignty and identity, it really is important, and you’re prepared to fight for it,” he says. One key theme is that few in Dublin were interested in using the Free State’s association with the Commonwealth to try to achieve unity – the removal of partition just wasn’t a priority. “Every time there was a choice between extending sovereignty or limiting it to make a connection with unionists, politicians of all parties down here went for sovereignty.” His catalyst was a “lovely, thoughtful present” Miriam O’Callaghan gave him when he left Prime Time in 2020: the Saorstát Éireann Official Handbook. He was fascinated by how various essayists in the 1932-published book downplayed constitutional links with Britain and “put the best possible gloss” on the State’s international standing. Two years later, while in London covering Queen Elizabeth’s funeral, he was struck by how “deeply odd” certain elements seemed. “The Lord Chamberlain was going to break his wand of office and place it on her coffin, and I thought, ‘That’s a bit Harry Potter, isn’t it?’ It just got me thinking. The whole thing about the Crown was the cause of the Civil War, in effect, and yet it’s the kind of thing that we, at this stage, don’t really regard as being of any importance.” I was in Leinster House for 12 years ... you do become institutionalised The book only took three years – “pretty fast by my standards” – as he was able to draw on research he had done for his biographies of Éamon de Valera and another former taoiseach, John A Costello. [ Dev – Rise and Rule review: Chatty, well-made series fails to decode Éamon de ValeraOpens in new window ] Still, he found he had “quite a bit to do”, from trawling through the UK’s National Archives in Kew to “joining the dots in a slightly different way”, and he’d sold the project to his wife, Anne-Marie Smyth, on the basis that it would be straightforward. “She was very enthusiastic about it, possibly because I lied to her about how long it would take.” Free State to Republic was his planned title, but Smyth – who edits RTÉ’s children’s news programme, news2day – proposed From Crown to Harp. “Yeah, she’s good at these things,” he says. He also obtained the required permission from RTÉ management. Would this be a different book if he wasn’t an employee of RTÉ? “No, I don’t think so. Certainly, consciously, there was nothing where I thought ‘I better not say that’. Like, it’s sufficiently far in the past, I think, that it probably won’t come back to bite me. But then lots of people have thought that about lots of things. Ha!” Everything seems to be happening at once for McCullagh, with September seeing the broadcast of his two-part series on de Valera, Dev: Rise and Rule. In it he detailed how no trace has ever been found of Vivion de Valera, the man said to be his father. He worried that the coverage this sparked “gave the impression that we were maybe being a bit tabloid about it”, but he was pleased overall by the reception, and the ratings were “not quite The Traitors, but not bad”. When I mention that my first introduction to Dev as a child in 1980s Dublin was the skipping rhyme that began “vote, vote, vote for de Valera”, he says a friend told him similar, but only after he’d spent eight years writing his two-volume biography. “So, useless!” he declares cheerily. “You’re useless as well!” The new book is dedicated to his parents, Robin and June, who are “still hale and hearty, thankfully” and did a lot for him and his older brother when they were growing up in Dublin, on Newtownpark Avenue in Blackrock. After studying history and politics at UCD, his career began when he was hired by the Evening Press in 1989. A subsequent Master’s degree “became a PhD, which became a book” – A Makeshift Majority, about the 1948-1951 government – and he discovered he enjoyed longer forms of writing than the “12-14 paragraphs, tops” he had at the newspaper or, later, the 300 words he could squeeze into a typical TV report. He joined RTÉ in September 1993 and after various gigs became political correspondent in 2001. “I was in Leinster House for 12 years. [It] sounds like a prison sentence, and you do become institutionalised.” [ RTÉ’s new radio schedule a hurried defensive reflex to sour taste left by Ray D’Arcy exitOpens in new window ] Lots of late nights? “It was mad, particularly because I was there during the whole bailout and everything. It was just the maddest time ever.” He recalls the chaotic January 2011 day when Fianna Fáil TDs openly conspired outside the Dáil chamber to oust then taoiseach Brian Cowen. “Normally they do their plotting and back-stabbing in private, but they were doing it completely in the open. Wild. Absolutely wild.” Plunging into history – which he self-deprecatingly calls his “schtick” – helps him unwind from the intensity of unfolding political drama, and it has underlined for him, too, how so much of politics is about personal relationships. I ask what he thought about Leo Varadkar’s memoir, but he hasn’t read it yet – it’s on his list. “I’m banned from purchasing books for myself from September to Christmas, because my birthday is in December, and apparently I’m very difficult to buy for,” he says, with a gentle strain of mock indignation. Varadkar has said it was McCullagh’s advice that inspired him to release it. Mcullagh confirms: “I told him that if you don’t write your version of history, people in the future will rely on some other fella’s version of history, and it might not be to your benefit.” Perhaps his own book might be a good Christmas gift option for the tough-to-buy-for demographic? “Oh, absolutely,” he says quickly. “Every home should have at least one copy, if not two.” He was ready to move on from Leinster House when Pat Kenny’s surprise departure for Newstalk triggered that station’s “move the dial” campaign and left a vacancy on Prime Time. His seven years on the current affairs flagship were “good times, happy times”. Presenting the Six One “wasn’t something that I particularly envisaged for myself”, but he has enjoyed that too. The big switch to Today has been instigated by another defection to Newstalk, this time Claire Byrne’s. McCullagh is one of those broadcasting heavyweights who wears his intellect lightly, and his reporting experience, depth of insight and tonal flexibility should combine to make him a strong and entertaining successor. But the job, which pays a salary of €209,000, also comes with pressure to maintain the show’s listenership amid direct competition from “class act” Byrne. Will his Today be different from Byrne’s Today? “I guess if you change presenter, it’s inevitably going to have some differences, but I mean it’s a very successful programme and people like it.” True, Today’s buoyant listener figures throughout the Kenny, Sean O’Rourke and Byrne eras imply that the midmorning show’s format and slot – rescheduled after we meet to start one hour earlier – are more important than the presenter. “So they can put any eejit in and it won’t matter. I see what you’re saying there, Laura!” Well, he doesn’t want to be the one to break that streak, does he? “No, no, indeed,” he says. “But, you know, the dial moves both ways.” Unfortunately, my face betrays me sometimes He will finish on the Six One on Halloween night, then start on Today soon after. He will also stop co-hosting RTÉ’s Behind the Story podcast – “I think 10 hours of me on air a week is probably enough” – but he credits it with getting him out of his comfort zone and showing people he isn’t always completely serious. His eyebrows go into immediate overdrive after I note that viewers often respond to his facial expressions. There can be some side-eye, too, I suggest, referencing one screengrab, captured during an election debate in 2020, that became a meme. “That was weird, it’s become a bit of a thing, but I wasn’t aware the camera was on me. I was actually trying to communicate with the editor in the gallery.” The eyebrow gymnastics, and everything else, are all “completely unconscious”, he says. “Unfortunately, my face betrays me sometimes.” Surely, in these days of visual radio, he will still be on screen? “It’ll all be on webcam, and apparently you’ll be able to see me on the RTÉ News channel, unless something better is on.” He reminisces about how the addition of cameras meant he had to be “careful with the hand signals” when he returned to Radio 1’s This Week in 2018. “It nearly got me in trouble a couple of times,” he says. What kind of hand signals? “Let’s not go there!” When he’s not working or writing, he swims, reads “quite a lot” and watches TV with his wife – the couple live in Stillorgan, while their daughter, Rosie (24), is studying in London. He goes to Leinster rugby matches and gigs when he can, one artist being especially close to his heart – in 2022, he said he’d been to see Bruce Springsteen 33 times. “Ah, that was then,” he says. The updated tally is 41. The last two times he brought Rosie, and she loved it. “That was just fantastic, because I think I probably overdid playing the Springsteen songs for her when she was growing up, and she wasn’t really into it then.” Sending From Crown to Harp to the printers was “a great relief”, he says, and he’s excited now about his Today adventure. “But it’s a challenge, and I’m sure there’s plenty of people out there in the long grass hoping I’ll fall flat on my face.” I don’t know who they would be, I say. Has he got a bitter rival at RTÉ? “Oh god, no. It’s all sweetness and light in RTÉ.” From Crown to Harp by David McCullagh is published by Gill.

Title: $536M In Sell Pressure: Why Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashed

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The cryptocurrency market has been hit with another wave of sell pressure as both the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices plunged sharply, triggering widespread panic and uncertainty. With over $536 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in a single day, the downturn has sparked renewed fears of an extended bearish phase. Analysts are calling this correction a “Bloody Friday,” a less but still severe reflection of last week’s brutal selloff that wiped billions in the market and saw BTC and ETH spiraling downwards. The recent crash in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices is being attributed to recent large-scale outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Crypto analyst Jana on X social media described the event as one of the bloodiest weekly downturns of the quarter, with Bitcoin tumbling 13.3% in seven days and Ethereum sliding 17.8% over the past month. At press time, Bitcoin is trading slightly above $106,940 while Ethereum sits around $3,870, both suffering steep retracements from their recent highs. Data from SoSoValue shows that Thursday, October 16, saw a staggering $536.4 million in daily net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking the largest single-day negative flow since August 1, when $812 million exited the market. Out of twelve US Bitcoin ETFs, eight registered major outflows, led by $275.15 million leaving Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB, followed by $132 million from Fidelity’s FBTC. Notably, funds managed by other major companies like Grayscale, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also reported significant withdrawals. These persistent outflows have now stretched into their third consecutive day, with October 17, just a day ago, recording a massive outflow of $366.5 million. The sustained negative ETF flows underscore waning investor confidence and suggest that the broader market downturn could continue in the near term. Combined with the $19 billion liquidation event last Friday, increased outflows in ETFs could put more selling pressure on the already fragile market. Many experts believe that the crypto market may still have more room for a decline. Data from Polymarket, one of the world’s largest prediction platforms, show that 52% of participants expect Bitcoin to drop below $100,000 before the end of October. Veteran economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has also warned that the coming months could be catastrophic for the industry, predicting widespread bankruptcies, defaults, and layoffs as Bitcoin and Ethereum face another major leg down. Meanwhile, technical analysts are pointing to signs of deeper weakness in Ethereum’s structure. According to Crypto Damus, Ethereum has broken key weekly support and is displaying a bearish setup on the charts. He says that MACD is about to “cross red,” leaving a significant amount of room for a crash. Other analysts like Marzell have echoed similar concerns, stating that Ethereum is now nearing a “crash zone.” However, he also highlighted the $3,690 – $3,750 range as a possible short-term demand area where buyers could step in again and trigger the next leg up.

U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hemorrhaged money Thursday, snapping a two-week streak of consistent inflows as participants continue to tread carefully in the wake of Friday’s historic flash crash. The 11 funds recorded $536.4 million in net outflows, marking the sharpest single-day capital flight since August 1. Ark $ 21Shares’ ARKB suffered the largest outflow with $275.15 million exiting, while Fidelity’s FBTC posted $132 million in withdrawals, and Grayscale’s converted GBTC product witnessed $45 million flee, according to SoSoValue data. Spot ETFs managed by BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie also saw capital exodus. Spot Ethereum ETFs also registered $56.8 million in net outflows on Thursday, ending the positive inflow streak witnessed in the previous two trading days. Grayscale’s ETHE suffered the largest single-day outflow with $69 million exiting on Oct. 16, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $15.8 million flee. The dwindling demand comes as markets continue to nurse losses after President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese imports, responding to Beijing’s threat to cut off exports of rare earth minerals, which are vital to U.S. technology manufacturing. The surprise announcement sparked the biggest liquidation event on record, with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. While Bitcoin recovered to around $115,000 earlier this week after Trump seemingly tried to de-escalate the tariff war, tensions continue. Crypto prices extended their corrections today, with BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, plummeting to as low as $103,856 in the past day. Meanwhile, Ethereum blockchain’s native token, Ether, fell 1.9% to $3,829 alongside bigger losses in the altcoin market, according to CoinGecko data.

One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the September earnings season having just begun, starting this week we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans in this column. Here are some from companies that reported their earnings so far. BlackRock Inc (BLK, $182.3 billion) The world’s largest asset manager said its JioBlackRock venture marks a key step in expanding access to local investing and retirement products in India. “The Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather than investors. Through JioBlackRock, we’re enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies and financial assets.” Brown-Forman Corp (BFB, $13.4 billion) The American spirits-maker sees India as a major long-term growth engine for its flagship Jack Daniel’s brand, driven by premiumisation and rising social acceptance of alcohol. “Since Covid, there’s been a rising social acceptance of beverage alcohol in India, particularly among younger consumers. India is the second-largest whiskey market in the world, growing around 8 per cent annually — a perfect storm for Jack Daniel’s growth.” Firan Technology Group (FTG, C$254.8 billion) The Canadian aerospace and defence electronics firm is setting up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad to tap India’s cost advantages and policy support. “We concluded India is a very cost-effective place for manufacturing, with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India policy and strong aerospace spending making it an ideal place to operate.” Pernod Ricard SA (RI, €21.9 billion) The French spirits major reported steady growth in India despite a sharp excise tax hike in Maharashtra that weighed on demand. “While India continues to enjoy strong consumer demand, the 50 per cent increase in excise tax in Maharashtra led to higher prices and a consequential impact on sales, partly offset by strong growth in Royal Stag and international brands like Jameson.” Published on October 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Apple is still the best brand in the world, according to Interbrand's report

The Best Global Brands shows which brands are going up, and which are going down... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Interbrand has released its annual Best Global Brands ranking and there's very little movement at the top. The top five are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Samsung in that order, showing that Apple is still... well.... the Apple of many eyes. Other notable brands that rose up through the ranks include Nvidia, Instagram, YouTube, Uber and Netflix. Nvidia had a particularly huge increase (116 per cent), the biggest in the history of the Best Global Brands. There is also the highest number of new entries of any Best Global Brands report, with Uniqlo, Booking.com, Shopify and Blackrock among the newcomers. The reports methodology includes looking at financial analysis, the role of the brand (the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand as opposed to other factors) and brand strength, which takes into account brand loyalty. And it's no surprise to us that some of these top brands are also in our best logos list. In the automotive sector, Toyota held on to its number 6 position while Mercedes and BMW also made the top 20 (10 and 14, respectively). In success stories, Ferrari has seen 17 per cent growth (in at 54) while on the flipside, Tesla declined 35 per cent to number 25. Jaguar was nowhere to be seen and hasn't ranked on its own since 2018. I imagine its recent rebrand probably hasn't helped matters. In terms of media and entertainment brands, it was Instagram that stood out as it surged 27 per cent and entered the top 10 for the first time (at number eight). YouTube also saw huge growth, with an increase of 61 per cent to spot number 13 (explore the brand's history with our YouTube logo history). Elsewhere, Netflix surged 42 per cent, and climbed 10 places to number 28. When you think about brands that people use every day for entertainment, neither of these three are a shock. I'm frankly surprised that Netflix wasn't ranked higher. In the world of luxury, Gucci dropped out of the top 50 altogether (to number 69) while Hermés grew 18 per cent (and made it to spot 21) and Chanel managed to cling on to the top 25 at number 24 despite shrinking 8 per cent. Interbrand suggests this may be due to prices post-Covid, which have discouraged some "aspiring middle-class consumers, creating a headwind for the sector". In the world of retail, it was bad news for IKEA and H&M which shrank 9 and 13 per cent, respectively, but good news for Uniqlo, which stormed into the charts at number 47. It must be all those cross-body bags it sold. Interbrand also outlines its Brands to Watch, which shines a light on brands predicted to enter the top 100 in future years. These include Burberry, Canon, KFC, PlayStation, WhatsApp, Zoom and Starbucks. It feels quite amazing that some of those brands aren't on the list already, but I guess there isn't room for everyone.

Investors are plowing money into a broad swath of assets putting the ETF industry in the driver’s seat of what may be another record year. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion, took a victory lap this week, touting ownership of some of the fastest-growing exchange-traded funds in history. "Our digital assets ETPs and active ETFs have grown from practically zero to 10 in 2023 to over $100 billion in digital assets and over $80 billion in active ETFs. The rapid growth of these premium categories is another proof point of our success in scaling distribution and quickly adapting to new offerings and in new markets," said CEO Larry Fink on the company’s earnings call this week. Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock Inc., which is the world's largest asset manager, overseeing $10 trillion globally. (Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) The star: iShares Bitcoin ETF — ticker IBIT — is now the largest crypto ETF, which gives investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it directly. Assets topped $100 billion earlier this month but have dipped with Bitcoin’s drop. The largest crypto by market value hit a record $126,272.76 on Oct. 6, 2025, and has since slipped below $110,000. BITCOIN SAFE HAVEN, INVESTOR SAYS Escalating tensions over the past week between the U.S. and China are hurting sentiment for digital assets. This as gold popped to a fresh record high of $4,280.20 an ounce. Another standout, iShares Ethereum ETF -ticker ETHA with assets around $16 billion. AMERICANS FAVOR TRUMP'S $1,000 BABY SAVINGS PLAN "Our flagship offerings in IBIT and ETHA were among the top five inflowing products in the ETP industry," Martin Small, CFO and global head of corporate strategy detailed on the call. Like bitcoin, ethereum has dipped to the $3,800 level from its high of $4,955.23 reached on Aug. 24, 2025. LIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES: HERE Still, bitcoin and ethereum have each advanced about 14% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500’s 13% rise as of Friday. BlackRock BlackRock shares are up 14% year to date.

Title: Wall Street's rising stars share how they set boundaries and avoid burnout — even in one of the toughest industries

Pressure is among the few certainties of daily life on Wall Street — and knowing how to manage it is key to success. Business Insider asked its 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street how they set boundaries and maintain routines to stay grounded in an industry where the threat of burnout lurks behind each promotion. All of them are standing out at some of the country's top financial firms at age 35 or younger, and somehow maintaining personal lives and sanity in the process. Since Wall Street has little respect for the evening hours, mornings are precious to many of this year's rising stars, particularly when it comes to exercise. From focusing on family, to cooking, to purposefully feeling bored for a few minutes, here are some of the ways finance's young leaders find — and keep — balance. True to the gym-obsessed stereotype, many of the Wall Streeters said exercising is key to staying grounded, especially in the hours before work. Sweating it out at the gym helps relieve the stress they'll likely face during the day, some told Business Insider. As Lamar Cardinez, a principal at Blue Owl, put it, the gym "helps me feel fully awake quickly and supplies you with the energy needed for a full workday." "I'm a morning person, and I will be the person, unfortunately, who will sacrifice sleep so that I can exercise," Catherine Kress, chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and a big runner, said. For others, playing sports or spending time outside provides the much-needed physical relief. The up-and-comers opt for everything from golf to tennis to snowboarding to yoga to skiing. And though their interests are diverse, Alex Park, a principal at Thoma Bravo, admitted his typical finance bro tendencies when it comes to health habits. "I'm sure you've heard too many people in finance, especially in Miami, talk about padel," he said, referencing the racquet sport popular with America's wealthy. "But I do very much enjoy that sport as well." Another interest that helps him stay grounded? Wellness and longevity science, which he was sure Business Insider had heard "a fair amount." Colleagues might dominate many of the waking hours during the week, but some of the Wall Streeters told Business Insider that prioritizing family is crucial to excelling in their field. For Mohini Chakravorty, a principal at Blackstone, it's knowing that her family pick up the phone "at any point in time." For GTCR's Natalie Lamberton, it's talking after-work walks with her 6-month-old daughter and decompressing her week with her husband every Friday night. Among those who are parents, some said seeing their kids before and after work gives them the perspective they need to walk into the office and inevitable pressure. "I have my wife and my one and a half year old son, and that's my code of comfort," Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, said. "She and my son give me a lot of anchoring so as to make sure that you can do what you need to do once you're out of the house." Joe Slevin, a managing director in Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory group, often unwinds with his wife and three kids, but finds his friends are a necessary lifeline too. "I would say that a few active text threads with old funny friends is essential." Chakravorty is a "huge foodie," and loves to explore the New York City restaurant scene. The same goes for Benson Kane, a vice president at TPG who said he often explores new spots in the city with his wife. Lamberton said she enjoys cooking with her husband, and Chakravorty said she often cooks with her boyfriend as well. A number of the stars treat logging off as more than shutting their computer, and carve out intentional time to get away from their screens. Blackstone's Knut Kirchoff figured out how important it is to spend at least 30 minutes with a book and away from the glow of his phone during the pandemic, and he still keeps up the habit to help him wind down. Cardinez meditates, Lamberton makes time on her commute to purposefully feel bored, and Jake Woodson, the head of US distressed credit trading at Goldman Sachs, spends time in the Catskills. "When it feels like all that matters in the world is XYZ bond all week, getting into the world and getting into nature and experiencing something different is invaluable and gives you motivation to come back to do it," he said. Beyond reading a physical newspaper in the morning with his coffee, Kirchoff tries to bring some analog habits to the office. He tracks his daily tasks in a paper notebook, crossing them off as they're completed. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: Ford CEO Admits Automakers Didn’t Consider Their Customers When Going ‘Full Bore’ Into EVs

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/18/2025 4:10:31 AM PDT by Adder American automakers have long prided themselves on building vehicles that meet the real needs of hardworking families and businesses across the country. Yet, recent revelations from Ford’s leadership paint a different picture when it comes to the rush into electric vehicles. Former Ford CEO Mark Fields openly acknowledged that the industry charged ahead with massive EV investments, overlooking what consumers actually wanted. Fields, who led Ford from 2014 to 2017, pointed out the misstep during a discussion on the rapid buildup of EV production. “Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs,” he said. This aggressive push came without enough thought to buyer preferences, leaving companies like Ford and GM facing unexpected market realities. (Excerpt) Read more at thelibertydaily.com ...

Title: Ethereum: Assessing how ETH could outperform Bitcoin in Q4

Time Published: 2025-10-18T11:00:02Z

BlackRock and institutional moves put Ethereum in focus. Ethereum is holding a net gain of 7.02% versus BTC’s 4.34% for October, with on-chain stablecoin inflows signaling institutional interest. BlackRock’s recent moves, combined with the ETH/BTC ratio nearing 0.04, suggest strategic rotation rather than a short-term trade. So far in Q4, Ethereum [ETH] has lagged behind Bitcoin [BTC], showing a 6.94% dip. But if we look closely, BTC is only 1.15% ahead, despite its nearly 11% rally in the first week that pushed it to an all-time high of $125k. From a technical perspective, BTC’s net gain for October stood at 4.34%, at press time, while ETH remained at a net gain of 7.02% following its 15% first-week surge. In short, ETH is still holding strong relative to BTC. Notably, this resilience is evident on the weekly chart. BTC has dropped 7.15% with two back-to-back lower-low candles, testing its late-June support at $103k. ETH, on the other hand, is holding onto its August gains. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is on the verge of snapping its first weekly green, bouncing nearly 9% off the recent crash to 0.03, reinforcing the thesis that rotation into ETH could be gaining momentum. On-chain, Ethereum’s stablecoin supply is signaling the same strength. The 7-day stablecoin supply on Ethereum has jumped 2.18%, adding $3.47 billion and pushing the total to a fresh all-time high of $163 billion. Simply put, more dry powder is flowing into the ecosystem. Combine this with Ethereum’s resilience versus BTC, and it raises the question: Is rotation into ETH shaping up to be more strategic than a short-term trade? BlackRock is driving the rotation thesis in action. Arkham data shows the firm moving 300 BTC across its last fifteen transactions, accounting for roughly 4,500 BTC offloaded. At the same time, it accumulated 12,400 ETH from Coinbase Prime. The effects are visible on the chart: Ethereum was up 1.12% intraday, holding the $3,830 support despite ongoing weakness in ETH ETFs, while the ETH/BTC ratio hiked 1.56%, at the time of writing, inching closer to key resistance at 0.37. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) In this setup, the surge in stablecoin liquidity isn’t random. Instead, it points to “targeted” capital flowing into Ethereum, suggesting that institutions are rotating for a longer-term rather than chasing short-term trades, with October’s price action so far reinforcing this strategy. Against this backdrop, the ETH/BTC ratio is eyeing the 0.04 zone, signaling a potential breakout in favor of Ethereum versus Bitcoin, suggesting that ETH’s monthly lag may be nothing more than a short-term blip.

Tributes have been paid to a Dublin man who was killed following a road traffic incident in the US. John Kirby died in hospital on Wednesday, following an incident involving a truck which happened in Austin, Texas, on Friday 10 of October. Mr Kirby, who was in his 20s, had been in the US on a J1 visa and was living with two friends. Blackrock Rugby Football Club has paid tribute to him, saying he "made a huge impact both on and off the field". In a post on the club's website, Director of Rugby Michael Hearty said that Mr Kirby will be remembered "fondly for his smile, his laughter, and his spirit". "John had that special kind of presence. A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressing room. "Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. "He was the sort of teammate you were always happy to see walk through the door." Mr Hearty also described John as a great worker, adding that "the word 'no' was not in his vocabulary". He extended his condolences to all of his friends and family. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it is aware of the case and is providing consular assistance. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs see $1.2 Billion in weekly outflows

The United States’ spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced a challenging week, with over $1.2 billion in total outflows as Bitcoin prices tumbled. Despite the decline in institutional inflows, Charles Schwab says investor engagement with crypto-related products is rising, reflecting a growing interest among retail and institutional clients in digital assets. Data from SoSoValue shows that the eleven US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded $366.6 million in outflows on Friday, closing out a negative week for both the products and the broader cryptocurrency market. The largest withdrawal came from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which lost $268.6 million in a single day. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw substantial redemptions totaling $67.2 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC experienced $25 million in outflows. A smaller withdrawal was reported from the Valkyrie Bitcoin ETF, while the remaining funds saw no activity on Friday. In total, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US witnessed $1.22 billion in outflows over the past week, with only one day—Tuesday—showing minor inflows. The downturn coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin’s price, which fell from above $115,000 on Monday to just below $104,000 on Friday, marking a four-month low. The steep decline highlights how sensitive institutional products remain to Bitcoin’s price movements, with ETF investors appearing to pull back amid growing market uncertainty. While ETF redemptions signal cooling sentiment among some investors, Charles Schwab remains optimistic about the long-term potential of digital asset investment products. Speaking on CNBC, CEO Rick Wurster revealed that Schwab’s clients now hold 20% of all crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the US. He added that interest in crypto has grown substantially over the past year, with visits to the company’s crypto-related webpages up 90%. “Crypto ETPs have been very active,” Wurster said, emphasizing that the topic continues to draw high engagement from investors. ETF analyst Nate Geraci noted that Schwab’s large brokerage platform positions it well to capture future demand. The firm already offers crypto ETFs and Bitcoin futures and plans to launch spot crypto trading for clients in 2026, signaling a long-term commitment to the sector even amid short-term volatility. October, historically one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, has so far delivered disappointing results. Data from CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin has gained in ten of the past twelve Octobers, but this year, the asset is down 6% month-to-date. Despite the slump, some market analysts remain hopeful that the trend of “Uptober” could return in the second half of the month. Many point to the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year as a catalyst that could reignite demand for risk assets, including Bitcoin. For now, however, the combination of ETF outflows, price pressure, and macroeconomic uncertainty has weighed heavily on crypto sentiment—leaving investors to watch whether the coming weeks can reverse October’s red start.

Title: Analysts Caution Cardano (ADA) May Drop Further Before $1 Rebound After 12% Dip

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Cardano (ADA) fell roughly 27% this week, slipping below the $0.66 support as risk-off flows hit crypto. Bitcoin’s slide toward $104,000 and softer altcoin liquidity magnified downside, and on-chain data shows large holders leaning defensive. Santiment-tracked wallets holding 1–10 million ADA offloaded about 40 million ADA over seven days, while broader whale distribution reportedly reached 350 million ADA, pressuring price. other big wallets accumulated 140–200 million ADA, creating a split tape that’s fueling choppy consolidation between $0.65–$0.70. Derivatives add to the cautious tone. Cardano’s open interest slipped 2.12% to $669.9 million, and long liquidations ($1.13 million) dwarfed shorts ($187,000), signaling bulls bore the brunt of the latest flush. On the 4-hour chart, ADA is carving a falling wedge, but confirmation requires a breakout above $0.74. Until then, momentum indicators remain mixed: RSI 37 (approaching oversold) while CMF 0.12–0.15 hints at returning spot inflows that have yet to overpower supply from large holders. Technicians flag a “risk-first” path: losing $0.66 puts $0.65 in play; failure there opens $0.62–$0.60, then $0.57 (channel/structure confluence). A deeper shakeout could probe $0.53 if broader crypto weakness persists. On the upside, ADA must reclaim $0.66 and then clear $0.74–$0.80 (50-day EMA cluster) to flip trend strength. Above that range, bulls target $0.86, with a psychological $1.00 retest feasible into Q4 if risk appetite and flows improve. Several analysts still eye a path toward $1.20–$1.60 on a confirmed breakout, but most caution the market may dip before it rips given leverage resets and uneven liquidity. ETF headlines (including the Oct. 23 Grayscale ADA ETF decision window), stablecoin and ETF net flows, and whether whale selling cools. A rotation back into altcoins typically follows BTC stabilization; conversely, renewed BTC downside would likely extend ADA’s consolidation near the lows. Beyond price, Cardano’s community treasury has surpassed 1.6 billion ADA ($1 billion), funded by fees and staking rewards and governed via Project Catalyst, a war chest that supports tooling, DeFi, and infrastructure without VC overhang. New staking access (e.g., eToro U.S.) and ongoing initiatives like Midnight and Leios continue to broaden the roadmap, even as TVL ($288 million) lags larger chains.

Title: Should every midlife woman be on HRT - even with no menopause symptoms?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/10/18/hrt-theres-no-need-for-suffering-any-more-like-our-mothers-and-grandmothers-did/

Suzanne Noonan, a mother of three children, struggled for months with debilitating anxiety, hot flushes and poor sleep but was afraid to look for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as there is a history of breast cancer in her family. A friend, a beautician who had heard clients say HRT had changed their lives for the better, urged her to try it. By the time Noonan (45) went to her GP in Co Limerick a year ago, “my adrenaline was through the roof”. The doctor reassured her about the breast cancer risks and strongly recommended HRT, as the pros outweighed the cons. “So I bit the bullet.” Within two weeks, “I was so mellow and just felt right again in the world.” Now she recommends that any woman troubled by menopausal-related symptoms should go to their GP and “take the leap to HRT – you will not regret it”. The message that women need not suffer in silence during perimenopause and menopause is spreading. With increasing evidence of other health benefits from the repletion of waning hormones, even those without troubling menopausal symptoms may wonder if they are missing out by not going on HRT. It doesn’t even cost anything, since the State has made the medication free since June 1st. Could that prove to be another psychological nudge? This week there was news of a study, led by the University of Galway, that indicated a link between HRT after menopause and a lower risk of dementia. Last week, eminent consultant endocrinologist Dr Donal O’Shea talked of “medical consensus” that all women should go on it at the time of menopause, unless there are strong contraindications. “Oestrogen replacement is good for bones, it’s good for heart, it’s good for brain,” O’Shea told Jen Hogan on The Irish Times podcast Conversations with Parents. He said he would be advising his daughters, “if I’m around when they’re post menopausal”, to go on it. While many agreed and welcomed his comments, others had a different view. “I think Donal should stay in his lane,” says Dr Deirdre Lundy, clinical lead of the complex menopause clinic in the National Maternity Hospital (NMH). While she says he is entitled to express his opinion, “that most certainly is not the medical consensus”. The “actual consensus”, based on international guidelines, according to Lundy, is that there are only two reasons to go on HRT. “One is for symptom control, and in that case there is no protocol for how long to take it or when to stop it. If your symptoms continue to trouble you and you want to stay on it for 20 or 30 years, which, by the way, I’ve done myself, so I’m not an anti-HRT person, then you go right ahead.” The second indication for treatment is bone density. “A primary use of HRT, even for people with no symptoms, would be low bone quality.” In addition to proven benefits for the heart and bones, it is believed there are other positives “but the data is not there yet. That is why the consensus is not to put everybody on HRT and not to stay on it forever”. [ Does femtech suggest so-called women’s troubles might soon be taken as seriously as men’s?Opens in new window ] About 20-30 new people a month are seen at the NMH clinic, one of six public, specialist menopause services around the country. GPs, who do most HRT prescribing, can refer more complex cases to these clinics. The decision whether or not to take HRT is very individualised, says Cork GP Dr Ciara McCarthy, clinical lead for women’s health in the Irish College of General Practitioners. It should only be considered by somebody after discussing with a GP the risks and benefits for them personally. Despite it being acclaimed as good for the heart, “the international guidelines would say that HRT is generally not recommended for asymptomatic women solely for the prevention of cardiovascular disease”. Cardiologist Dr Blaithnead Murtagh of Blackrock Health in Galway also stresses the need for “a holistic, individualised approach to menopausal women, including lifestyle advice, diet modification, as well as discussion on the role of HRT”. If there are no problematic symptoms, she does not recommend HRT for future cardiac health reasons. However, HRT prescribed before the age of 60, or within 10 years of the menopause, “is likely associated with a reduction in coronary heart disease and cardiovascular mortality”. Women with early menopause, she adds, should be encouraged to use HRT until the average age of menopause, which is 51 in Ireland, according to the HSE. Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage Periods stopping before the age of 45 is considered early menopause and puts women at a higher risk of not only cardiovascular disease but also bone loss, says McCarthy, which is another reason HRT would be recommended. Older women who have, or are at high risk of developing, osteoporosis could also benefit. During a menopause consultation, other factors that may be relevant to optimising health will be considered, such as vitamin D, calcium, smoking cessation, weight-bearing exercise and healthy diet. Addressing problems with blood pressure and high cholesterol, “will lead to knock-on improvements in long-term cardiovascular risk without taking HRT”. An increased risk of breast cancer, which is the concern women most often raise, is small, she says. The 2002 study by the Women’s Health Initiative, which linked HRT to an elevated risk of breast cancer, as well as blood clots and stroke, is now regarded as flawed, although the fear it generated still lingers. “Family history of breast cancer does not preclude the majority of women from using HRT,” says McCarthy. “But what your family history influences is your baseline risk of developing breast cancer.” The average woman, without a strong family history, has a 23 in 1,000 baseline risk of developing breast cancer in their 50s. This increases to 27 in 1,000 within five years of being on combined HRT, ie oestrogen and progestogen. However, among those on oestrogen-only medication, breast cancer incidence actually drops, to 19 per 1,000 women aged 50-59. (Most women are prescribed a combined form because progestogen is needed to protect against womb cancer.) The risk of breast cancer increases the longer HRT is used. The decision to start, or continue, is generally down to a person’s perception of acceptable risks, adds McCarthy. I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It’s a game changer There is both “toxic negativity” and “toxic positivity” towards HRT, and it is about finding a balance, says GP Dr Brian Kennedy, clinical lead at the midwest complex menopause clinic in Nenagh, Co Tipperary. “I wouldn’t agree that everybody needs HRT, but I do think everybody needs a conversation about HRT. Everybody needs to be aware of the risks and benefits and make their own decision,” he says. [ Relationships and ... menopause: ‘Small gestures of love can go a long way during this time of change’Opens in new window ] He thinks for about 20 per cent of women, menopause “is like a horrific illness – a mixture of physical, psychiatric and social unwellness that is so disabling”. It is obvious they need HRT. Another 20 per cent are probably okay without it – and there’s everybody in between. Hot flushes, insomnia and night sweats are widely recognised symptoms, but more subtle signs, such as brain fog, weight gain and stiff, sore joints, tend to be underplayed. Kennedy points out to patients that perimenopause and menopause do not happen in a vacuum. It is generally a very vulnerable time in women’s lives. They may be caring for teenagers or children, as well as ageing parents, and being pulled in all directions, while approaching the end of their fertility. “HRT is not going to solve everything, but it is definitely much more of a help than a hindrance in the vast majority of cases,” Kennedy says. There will always be women averse to pharmaceutical remedies for what is a natural transition in life. Indeed, the misconception of the menopause “as always being a medical issue which consistently heralds a decline in physical and mental health should be challenged”, argues Prof Martha Hickey of the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, in the Lancet medical journal. “Changing the narrative to view menopause as part of healthy ageing may better empower women to navigate this life stage and reduce fear and trepidation among those who have yet to experience it.” Prof Rose Anne Kenny, head of medical gerontology at Trinity College Dublin and founder of the Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing (Tilda), agrees “100 per cent” with O’Shea’s sentiments. “I feel very strongly that as medics we should be taking a much more holistic approach to HRT for women.” The protection it offers for bone density, for example, is important because fractures are a big reason for older people’s health going downhill. “The earlier you get in, the better – once your hormones have attenuated and you’re menopausal,” Kenny says. While it is primarily of value for menopausal symptoms, broader benefits include lubrication of mucosal surfaces, such as the mouth, eyes and vagina. “These aren’t related to diseases as such, but they’re very much related to quality of life for women.” Vaginal dryness can be classed as a menopausal symptom, she says. “Everybody gets that post menopause.” According to the Department of Health, the State will meet the cost of HRT where it has been prescribed “for the purpose of alleviating the symptoms associated with all stages of menopause”. Budget 2025 allocated €20 million for this scheme and, as the pharmacy dispensing fee is now also covered, this was increased to €24 million for 2026. “It’s fabulous now I don’t have to pay for it,” says Suzanne Noonan, who feels she never wants to come off HRT. “I see it as just replenishing the hormones that my body no longer produces. There’s no need for suffering any more like our mothers and our grandmothers did.” “I went through perimenopause and menopause not knowing,” says Tracey Latham, now aged 45. She initially put excessive sweating down to unhealthy lifestyle choices, but was also very angry and irritable. “I asked my GP for HRT patches a few times before finally being listened to. It’s a game changer – if only I was on them sooner, life would have been much better.” [ Perimenopausal and menopausal skin: How to tackle the most common problemsOpens in new window ] However, Anne from Co Wicklow says: “Personally, I started HRT and immediately felt much worse. I stopped it and felt better.” Jaimie (48) says she often raised the question of menopause with a GP after her periods stopped before she was 40. Instead she was prescribed anti-depressants. She ordered a kit online that told her she was in the menopause. “When your doctor won’t even acknowledge your symptoms, how can you proceed? I’ve tried to change GPs but there are so few in my area. It’s cruel.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Old Irish dressers, settle beds and dug-out chairs in a vernacular sale

Cavan auctioneer Victor Mee has built up a strong reputation for selling offbeat stuff, such as advertising memorabilia, antique garden furniture and vintage agricultural machinery. His next sale, live online from 3pm on Sunday, October 19th, will be filled with vernacular furniture, kitchen implements and even a few old metal tractor seats. Vernacular furniture – also known as country furniture – refers to the everyday furniture used in rural homes in the 19th and 20th centuries. In Ireland, pine tables, dressers, wooden chairs, dowry chests and wardrobes – mostly made of pine – are the main pieces of vernacular furniture for sale in auctions. Mee fell in love with it a long time ago. “I bought my first hedge chair in the 1970s for 50 pence and I’ve been enamoured ever since,” he says. “These pieces of furniture were born out of need and the pieces that survive today are like genuine historical artefacts.” Dressers remain popular for their original function – displaying the best crockery in the house – most of which was, and still is, only used for special occasions. There are a few dressers at the Mee auction, the best of which is a 19th-century painted pine dresser from Co Clare (€500-€800). It has three open shelves over a rows of short drawers and two lower cupboards with panelled doors. The pine settle bed was another staple of vernacular furniture. Usually positioned close to the hearth, this high-backed seat provided storage and seating during the day but could be converted to a bed at night-time. The Mee auction includes an early 19th-century pine settle bed from Cork, covered in old flaky paint (€800-€1,200) and another stripped pine settle bed (€250-€450). The 19th-century Irish pine dug-out chair is perhaps one of the more unusual lots (€1,000-€2,000). Dug-out chairs were exactly what you might think – a chair carved from a single trunk with the interior “dug out” for sitting on. It is crude and weathered looking, and Mee suggests it “speaks loudly of a forgotten era”. Shop fittings – in particular sets of drawers – have become sought after by homeowners drawn to eclectic interior styles. There are a few sets of shop drawers in various sizes but the most noteworthy are two sets of 56 drawers in pine from the 1940s (€1,000-€2,000 each). Auctions are also great places for picking up inexpensive crockery, and the Victor Mee auction has plenty of spongeware plates, platters, mugs and bowls from the 19th and 20th century. The set of six 19th-century spongeware soup bowls (€200-€400) are a good example of the style. As a way of creating a pattern on pottery, spongeware was first developed in the 18th century, becoming popular in Britain, Ireland and the United States in the 19th and 20th century. The patterns are created by pressing shaped sponges dipped in coloured pigment into the earthenware clay plate, bowl, jug or mug. This was a thriving cottage industry in the 19th century, and the pieces were often decorated at home by women before being glazed and refired in factories. Smudges, drips and variations in pattern added to the character, creating unique pieces. Contemporary potters such as Nicholas Mosse from Co Kilkenny were instrumental in reviving interest in spongeware techniques and designs. Three books written and signed by Ireland’s first president, Douglas Hyde, are among the lots for sale at Usher’s auction on Monday, October 20th from 6pm. The first edition books – Songs of St Columcille, The Children of Lir and The Children of Tuireann (€400-€700) – were published in the 1940s and are favourites among collectors. Hyde, who founded the Gaelic League, was a distinguished Gaelic scholar and author of many works, including A Literary History of Ireland. He was president from 1938 to 1945. Most of the wide variety of books at Usher’s auction, on view Saturday and Sunday, October 18th and 19th, noon-5pm, belonged to the late Gearóid Mac Gabhann (Gerry Smith). The son of Cavan footballer Big Jim Smith, Mac Gabhann was the founding member of Kilmacud Crokes club in Dublin. He played club football and later was mentor, coach and manager of football, hurling and camogie teams at Kilmacud Crokes. He was an accountant who worked as secretary manager for St Vincent’s hospital, Elm Park and later the Mater hospital. He was fluent in Irish and had a deep passion for Irish folklore, nature, political and local history, as this book collection testifies. The auction also includes manuscripts of religions from around the world, intriguing books on textiles and crafts. Many lots don’t have any estimates – leaving bidding completely open to interested parties. As befitting of a passionate supporter of the GAA, Mac Gabhann’s collection also includes early GAA programmes, medals and other ephemera, many of which are signed. John Weldon’s jewellery, watches and gold coin auction on Tuesday, October 21st, at 2pm, includes a lifetime’s collection of 48 pieces of Irish silver. These include a William IV Chinoiserie silver tea caddy made in Dublin in 1834 by James Fray (€1,000-€2,000), and an Irish silver crested two-handled cup by Robert Calderwood, made in the mid 18th century (€1,200-€1,800). victormeeauctions.ie; usherauction.ie; jwa.ie Estimate €1,200-€1,800 Hammer price €1,200 Auction house Sheppard’s Estimate €1,400-€1,800 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Sheppard’s Estimate €200 – €300 Hammer price €640 Auction house Adams Blackrock Hammer price €1,600 Auction house Adams Blackrock © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

ByNaveen Rao, Contributor. In their second annual Brain-Computer Interface Symposium, Mount Sinai Biodesign entreated attendees to an inside track on the top priorities and polarities defining BCI’s incomparable rise around the world. The world’s leading companies, neurosurgeons, clinical researchers, investors, advocates, and other leaders past, present and future convened for two days at the New York Academy of Medicine. After last year’s inaugural gathering, this installment drew a full house of 440 attendees and over 50 speakers. The streamlined program offered expert panels, heated debates, heartwarming stories, and a forum bustling with the intangible promises of discovery. Protocol Labs anchored this year’s sponsorship, signaling accelerating private interests in supporting neural research platforms, alongside Precision Neuroscience, Synchron and other companies. BCI defies easy alignment, categorization, or containment, representing a shared challenge and opportunity. For a fecund field tasked with defining, refining, regulating and selling itself while accelerating in every direction in real-time, growing pains are inevitable. The sessions included extensive presentations and discussions on technical advances and clinical methods, but the highlighted themes below are filtered through my lens of bringing this technology to people safely, sustainably, and responsibly, for all parties involved. This chicken-egg neurotech question knows no better stoa than this event, which kicked off with a lightning panel of eight leading BCI neurosurgeons. Their nuanced and wide ranging conversation underscored that progress depends upon and demands a healthy tension between today’s products and tomorrow’s science. Or, was it today’s science and tomorrow’s products? Invasiveness should not remain a limiting issue in BCI development, argued Michael Lawton, who leads Neuralink implantations as President and CEO of Barrow Neurological Institute. Lawton pointed to minimal scarring and chronic inflammation in both animal and human recipients of Neuralink’s n1 implant, arguing that the field should be aiming for “whole-brain BCI” as the goal, to read more data and develop more sophisticated applications. Today, this goal represents a collective effort with many hands on deck. Paradromics shared updates of their benchmarking work to gauge information transfer in neural recording with their Connexus BCI. Blackrock’s long-awaited neural lace is still in development. Emerging companies like Axoft, Neurobionics and Neurosoft are advancing next-generation arrays. In a later session, Ashwini Sharan, Medtronic’s chief medical officer of neuromodulation defended the medtech giant’s “right to compete” in the BCI space with adaptive DBS platform, cleared earlier this year, whose real-time read/write capabilities offer emerging evidence of the practical and clinical benefits of invasive tools, albeit for a narrow band of eligible patients. As for minimalist BCI, the question of electing brain surgery looms large. Elad Levy, from the University at Buffalo, offered a pragmatic view of helping as many people today with the safest technology available in market. He likened today’s BCI to the Wright brothers airplanes, guaranteed to evolve in the next five years and beyond. Levy, who led the IDE study for Synchron’s minimally invasive Stentrode device, has devoted his career to advancing less invasive, less expensive, more accessible approaches to next-generation stroke treatment. New neuroimaging tools are enabling the shift. As BCI propagate into neurosurgical suites around the world, precise brain mapping is emerging as a central need, pointed out Matthew Wilsey, a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan who recently implanted Paradromics’ first human user. Levy outlined his use of Neuronetics’ Trakstar platform along with Medtronic tools, which have helped move implantation towards a faster, more affordable outpatient setting without compromising safety or quality. Ian Cajigas from the University of Pennsylvania has led implants of Precision’s Layer 7 array. He reviewed how the limits of fMRI and MEG are opening the door for more advanced “connectomics” to create “wiring diagrams” to guide neurosurgery. In a later session, Michael Ivan from the University of Miami shared how he has used Omniscient’s mapping tools to optimize placement and performance of Neuralink’s device as part of their ongoing clinical trial. Chad Bouton of Northwell Health and founder of Neuvotion stole the show by revealing a “mind body connection” wherein Keith, a man living with a spinal cord injury whose double neural bypass was featured at this event last year, controlled a forearm device worn by Kathy, whose stroke left her partially paralyzed. Bouton explained, “When she holds something, he's literally helping her close his hand, because she's also living with paralysis. And he can now feel what she's holding.” In a video shared with attendees, Kathy sipped her diet coke, aided through over-the-skin wearables controlled by Keith’s thoughts. “It feels like you’re getting back a little bit of what was taken from you,” she told the audience, next to Keith. Neuvotion’s FDA-cleared sleeve is the first of a planned “neurorecovery ecosystem” of off-the shelf, BCI-compatible devices that defy easy value propositions in the best possible ways. In a later session, Chris Kellner from Mount Sinai charted the rapid advances in stroke rehabilitation over the years, from breakthroughs in vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) systems, EEG-based wearable BCI, and both old and new attempts with cortical implants. Stroke impacts 800,000 new people each year, widening the berth of chronic patients who can benefit from specialized care. Kellner’s work shows that even patients with several years “between stroke and rehabilitation can still have a robust improvement” using standard scales of functional assessment. Quantifying clinical benefits of BCI, whether in stroke, ALS, spinal cord injury, or other areas, remains the central challenge for commercial companies approaching regulatory clearance and reimbursement decisions. Jamie Brannigan from Mount Sinai encouraged conservative market estimates and tight clinical definitions for suitable BCI recipients. Omid Forouzan, VP of clinical affairs at Synchron, was among several leaders who highlighted the progress and pitfalls of advancing objective measures of digital autonomy, contextual functional independence, activities of daily living considered critical or “instrumental,” and other ways to measure value to end-users. Mariska Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center translated these tactical quality of life measures (feels, functions, survives) into the overarching concept of relational personhood, which gauges how people are, and feel, perceived as full persons by each other. Perhaps Congress needs a bit of the Dutch touch. In the first hour of the event, Lawton shared a video showing Brad Smith, one of Neuralink’s trial participants, playing games with his children through his BCI. In the next session, when Ian Burkhart, founder of the BCI Pioneers Coalition, asked ALS Caregiver and patient advocate MA Fernandez about how BCI could help her family, she answered “I really want Jules to be able to play videogames with Skyler,” referring to her husband and eight-year old son. Indeed. Former CMS Medical Officer Lee A. Fleischer opened the very next panel by saying “it’s very clear that video games don’t fit the reasonable, necessary criteria" after explaining that “CMS cannot pay for things unless Congress says so.” Fleischer pointed to past approvals for speech generation and exoskeleton devices, encouraging innovators to “understand the process and work within the structures because if not, you don’t win.” But when he said the agency’s job is to consider only the benefit and not the cost of new technologies, his panelists pushed back. Mijail Serruya from Thomas Jefferson University called out “quite a bit of hypocrisy in what is paid for” by CMS, cautioning that one-size fits all reimbursement in BCI “could be a trap” because people with identical impairments often have different functionality. David Putrino from Mount Sinai argued passionately that at the bedside, his job was to help drowning people, only for insurers to deny coverage by countering “people are not drowning, their legs just aren’t working. Send us more documentation on the legs.” “We’re in a new age,” Putrino declared. “Technology is advancing faster than ever before, and if we need to use the same system of checks and balances to get treatments through, it will die on the vine before it can help people. My very big fear about BCI is that if it flops now, it’s going to be 20 years before there’s any investor confidence to move forward.” Later that afternoon I moderated a panel with four neurotech investors to discuss market trends, commercial strategies, funding growth and evolution, categories versus platforms, globalization, and founder/funder dynamics. My panelists included Sean Escola, Head of Neurotech and NeuroAI at Protocol Labs, Peter Zhegin, Neurotech Director at e184, Adam Caplan, Founder at Jumpspace Ventures, and Konstantinos Alataris, BOD at Precision Neuroscience, Director at Forepont, and former founder and CEO of Nevro. This year’s funding for implanted BCI will double or triple last year’s $500+ million, driven by Neuralink’s recent $625 Series E. But beyond growth, the key investment trend to watch is the diversification of capital, traditional VC, strategic philanthropies, cryptocurrency firms, international government programs, and beyond. Zhegin observed this is not a purely market-driven trend, but one stemming from investor interest and personality factors. Escola described braiding grant dollars and venture dollars to optimize support across pre-commercial development. Alataris wants to see BCI strategy diverge from traditional med tech commercialization. His remarks followed a series of case studies he’d presented earlier to illustrate the lag between FDA approval and CMS reimbursement for both profitable and failed companies. This so-called valley of death hinders innovation and limits exit options for startups: “You spend 10 years getting to FDA approval, a minimum of $100 to 150 million, then you need to raise another $300 million to create your sales force, and you live and die based on this revenue.” All speakers advised founders navigating this landscape to understand their company’s value fully, and take time to explore all dimensions of the strategic value conferred by different types of backers on clinical and operational goals, from hiring to raising the next round. In a later question about founder X-factors in BCI, they mentioned the ability to secure both grant and venture dollars, quickly launch a research lab, along with requisite technical expertise and capabilities across the founding team. Alataris called on founders to opt for strategic capital and partnerships in big tech over med tech, while exploring profitable paths to sharing technology, revenue, IP, and maybe even data, with an eye on building for multiple applications. In discussing BCI platforms, he compared the potential to smartphones, Zhegin envisioned developer ecosystems like those at Intel or NVIDIA, while Caplan named read and write capabilities demonstrating sustained safety and performance. Escola called for more modular infrastructure across the ecosystem, so that each BCI company won’t have to absorb millions in equipment costs, and can focus more on business innovation. Building economies of scale in BCI will require vision, intention, and action. Science Corp’s Founder and CEO Max Hodak returned to this year’s event to share a heady list of updates that spanned bringing their retinal prosthesis closer to market, inventing synthetic proteins to enable optogenetic biohybrid arrays, and launching a new, next-generation technology stack to “rewrite the economics of BCI development.” Science’s enablement toolkit includes neural probes, next-generation headstage devices, and a full back end of software applications. Hodak said this modular approach “cuts the total development costs of bringing BCI therapy to market from over fifty to less than five million dollars." Coming from a single company, these developments demonstrate the platform approach discussed earlier. Similarly motivated offerings to scale innovation through interdependence are underway from Mint Neuro and Neuvotion, while new tools like Omniscient’s platform could also smooth the path for BCI startups. While these market innovations represent potential boons for a higher throughput R&D flywheel in the near-term, the longer term impacts on commercial BCI companies’ costs, value proposition (and value perception), and pricing strategies remain open questions. From the outside, a successful BCI ecosystem requires external leadership and vision, too. Beyond attracting diverse pools of capital as described above, neurotechnology’s momentum has drawn interest from public leaders outside the US federal government. Viq Pervaaz, the Senior Vice President of Life Sciences & Healthcare at NYCEDC, shared a macro-economic lens on skilled job creation, catalyzing company formation, leveraging healthcare and life sciences anchors, socioeconomic impact, and more. NYEDC’s ongoing partnership with Mount Sinai has also supported development of new cutting-edge treatments, entrepreneurship and spinouts, and deeper synergies in development. At a time of political gridlock and federal clawbacks across health, science, and global leadership, NYEDC and Mount Sinai’s system-driven collaboration offers a relevant playbook for leaders seeking to future-proof their economies. To build an application layer, BCI needs an application taxonomy, a mindset shift that has already brought the field to a crossroads. Bloomberg reporter Ike Swetlitz opened his panel of seven BCI executives and neurosurgeons by asking for perceptions about Neuralink’s claimed goals to implant “otherwise healthy people” in five years. Several panelists including Tom Oxley, Founder and CEO of Synchron hedged their answers with disclaimers about tight FDA definitions, Musk’s exuberance and the collective need to prioritize safety over rabbitholes. To be fair, Synchron’s sedulous leadership in advancing metrics and standards could arguably benefit this field even more than their high-profile partnerships with Apple and NVIDIA. And yet, the blitz of progress in the last year alone is publicly documented and undeniable: BCI is coming. Neuralink has gone from zero to 12 patients with permanent implants in the US and Canada in under two years. Precision has secured an FDA clearance, and in the time it took to publish findings from their first five patients, increased users by more than tenfold to 50+ people. In a notable breakthrough, Precision’s cofounder and chief science officer Ben Rapoport shared that this now includes patients without disabilities, such as a woman being treated for tumor removal who opted into the temporary implant to help advance research. “Building functional maps from healthy individuals could yield detailed maps of hand, speech and sensory representations,” said Rapoport, adding that such maps could also inform BCI implant targeting. Beyond the lane of motor neuroprostheses, some panelists pushed back on the definition of “healthy people,” pointing to differences between everyone, as well as market shifts towards a broader audiences and elective same-day procedures. Paradromics’ founder and CEO Matt Angle spoke openly about his dual vision as a “precisely defined medical device,” as well as a platform technology to turn capital-intensive R&D into “applications that unlock a broader future.” Jacob Robinson, founder and CEO of Motif Neurotech and author of the application taxonomy paper in question spoke of the BCI field’s shared goal to “create technology that is more normalized, with capabilities designed to bring us to the present.” His comments, underscored by Helen Mayberg later in the program, stressed that psychiatry suffers from need for more quantifiable, objective assessments. “It’s important to understand what’s happening in the circuit that drives your patient’s suffering. We’re not used to seeing dramatic, fast changes, in people who have failed to respond to years of medication.” Mayberg, a neurologist and director at Mount Sinai, pointed to 20 years of promising evidence of DBS’s efficacy in treating people living with severe depression. She urged the importance of closing clinical gaps with neurotechnology, starting with the lack of validated “facial or behavioral measures, or better, a measure from the brain, that tells us if they’re on the right track or need an adjustment.” Mayburg’s closing observation was that “these patients don’t know who they used to be. We’re having to chase the disorder by defining the disorder.” It reminded me of Alan Watt’s line, which applies to people as well as the BCI field as a whole: “Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.” Teeth gnashing about slow diagnostic innovation aside, BCI is evolving towards broader applications that can fit under the category of “human problems.” Ignacio Saez from Mount Sinai stressed that unlike motor BCI development, for cognitive and psychiatric BCI, "scientific knowledge, and our understanding of the neurobiological basis of cognitive and psychiatric processes, is still a major limiting factor." Unrelated to implanted BCI, Meta shared in a separate session that their newly launched EMG wristband took 6,000 training sessions for off the shelf-functionality, suggesting that we are in the early innings of this next frontier. Michael Ivan, Neuralink’s PI at the University of Miami, said our modern understanding of the brain “is that multiple areas work together to create something powerful. Together, they shape executive function, attention span, memory. As a neurosurgeon, I try to avoid these areas. But with BCI it’s the opposite – we’re trying to find these functional areas to figure out how to sense from them and stimulate them." With their second event, Mount Sinai’s BCI Symposium has cemented itself as a must-attend for those interested in the nexus of brain health and implanted technologies. With an eye on returning to New York in 2026, where I will hope for more interdisciplinary and diversified panels, as well as representation from newer companies in BCI and beyond, some closing thoughts on what’s ahead. Lastly, I asked MA Fernandez if I could share the message her husband Jules shared with attendees. As a young father to an 8 year old son, his ALS symptoms began 6 years ago, and have progressed to the point of his being confined to a wheelchair, dependent on a feeding tube and a breathing tube. Their story broke my heart but gave me hope. How much longer will it take before we can turn to BCI to help folks like Jules?

Title: Illusion of innovation: Indian ‘unicorn’ company becomes corporate cautionary tale

By Amanda Bartolotta October 17, 2025 For years, India has marketed itself as the world’s next great innovation hub, the emerging Silicon Valley of the East. Politicians, business leaders and industry groups have celebrated the nation’s engineers as global talent, proudly pointing to every Indian-origin CEO leading a major American tech firm as proof of India’s global prominence. The narrative being pushed has been that India was no longer just the world’s back office – it was the future of technology. Yet beneath the glossy slogans of “Digital India” and “Make in India,” reality dictates a very different story. The promise of innovation has rarely matched the results. As noted in a report by The Wire, India’s allure for investors stems not from its depth of talent, but from the fact that its “labor is cheap and laws are lax.” Still, American venture capitalists, eager to stake a claim in the “next tech frontier,” have bought into the illusion. Capital flowed, partnerships multiplied and billion-dollar valuations were built, not on genuine technological breakthroughs, but on carefully crafted narratives that sold success. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Why India copies well but fails to lead in innovation When “multinational educational technology company” BYJU’s emerged, it quickly became the perfect poster child for India’s startup dream. It was marketed as a unicorn – that is, a privately held startup company with a valuation of over $1 billion – proof that India could not only serve Silicon Valley, but become it. The company promised to transform how children learn and to usher in a new age of digital education. Yet, true to the national pattern, the promise unraveled quickly. From unicorn to black sheep Before its eventual financial and legal collapse, BYJU’s stood as one of India’s most celebrated startup success stories. Founded in 2011 and officially being dubbed a unicorn by 2018, it grew from a small tutoring operation into India’s most valued startup by 2022, ultimately being valued at $22 billion. Its learning app soon became a household name across India and founder Byju Raveendran earned a spot on the Forbes list of India’s richest people, celebrated as a self-made visionary transforming education. Former employees recalled his taste for five-star hotels and luxury cars, while his wife and co-founder, Divya Gokulnath, was seen networking in elite tech circles and Silicon Valley gatherings. Together, they emerged as global power players, symbols of a new generation of Indian entrepreneurs reshaping the country’s image on the world stage. At its peak, BYJU’s went on a buying spree, acquiring 19 companies for more than $2.6 billion. The goal was to expand its main products and strengthen its presence in the United States. The company added new areas such as coding, job training and lifelong learning to its offerings and even pushed into the Middle East by becoming the official sponsor of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. BYJU’s also hinted at plans to go public within a year, through an initial public offering (IPO) either in India or the United States. Both options were said to be under review, with no immediate deadline. Industry reports also suggested a possible merger with a U.S. special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that could have valued the business at around $40 billion, though co-founder Divya Gokulnath declined to comment. Yet, beneath the optimism, warning signs were already visible. Despite being valued at $22 billion in September 2022, BYJU’s parent company, Think & Learn Pvt. Ltd., reported a staggering $554.77 million loss for fiscal 2021, largely attributed to soaring marketing and employee expenses, leading to layoffs and cost-saving measures to push towards achieving profitability. The company’s rapid rise had been built on hype and expansion, but the financial foundation was already starting to crack. A fall from grace In December 2022, when India’s child-rights commission called out BYJU’s over complaints of overly aggressive sales targeting families and first-generation learners. In the months that followed, scrutiny widened to its coding unit, WhiteHat Jr, amid allegations regarding advertising claims and hard-sell tactics. WhiteHat Jr filed defamation suits against critics, but then withdrew the cases after public backlash. In April 2023, India’s Enforcement Directorate raided BYJU’s offices and later issued a $1.12 billion show-cause notice under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. The agency reported uncovering “incriminating” documents and digital evidence during the raid, citing serious financial violations, including missing regulatory filings, delayed export payments and unreported foreign direct investment transfers totaling about $3.37 billion between 2011 and 2023. Investigators also found that the company had transferred about $1.18 billion to multiple foreign jurisdictions during the same period, allegedly under the guise of overseas direct investment. Despite being issued multiple summonses, founder Byju Raveendran repeatedly failed to appear before authorities, remaining evasive throughout the investigation. The troubles didn’t stop there. The startup, backed by major investors including Prosus, Peak XV, Sofina, BlackRock, UBS and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, missed its revenue target for the financial year ending March 2023, according to financial statements released months behind schedule. Soon after, the company’s chief financial officer, Ajay Goel, resigned to return to Vedanta, marking yet another senior exit following the abrupt departures of auditor Deloitte and three key board members in June. The turmoil deepened when Prosus, one of BYJU’s earliest and largest investors, holding over 9% of the company, publicly criticized the firm in July for failing to evolve and for repeatedly ignoring investor guidance. These cascading resignations and public rebukes signaled that BYJU’s once-glowing image had fully unraveled and its troubles were only beginning. BYJU’s has raised a total of $4.45 billion over 27 funding rounds: 2 Early-Stage, 22 Late-Stage and 3 Debt rounds. BYJU’s’ largest funding round so far was a conventional debt round for $1.2 billion in November 2021. BYJU’s had a total of 132 investors, 105 being institutional investors and 27 Angel investors. From loan disputes to courtroom battles Through 2023 and into early 2024, BYJU’s mounting troubles spilled into the courts as disputes over a $1.2 billion U.S. term loan escalated. Court filings and investigative reports revealed that about $533 million had been routed through BYJU’s U.S. subsidiary, Alpha, into accounts tied to Camshaft Capital Management, a fund linked to a 23-year-old portfolio manager whose Miami business address once corresponded to an International House of Pancakes. The findings painted a picture of questionable transfers and lax oversight surrounding the billion-dollar loan. The financial strain only deepened. On July 16, 2024, the Board of Control for Cricket in India filed an insolvency case against BYJU’s over roughly $19 million in unpaid sponsorship dues. By the end of the year, both Deloitte and BDO had resigned as auditors, while major investors, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Prosus and Peak XV (Sequoia India) quit the board entirely. India’s Byju’s can’t pay employees At the same time, Qatar Holding petitioned the Karnataka High Court to enforce a $235 million arbitral award against Byju Raveendran and Byju’s Investments Pte Ltd tied to a 2022 $150 million loan for the Aakash acquisition, with interest sought at 4% per annum compounded daily from Feb. 28, 2024. The legal blows culminated in February 2025, when a U.S. bankruptcy court issued a summary judgment finding actual fraudulent transfers and breach of fiduciary duty related to the movement of funds through BYJU’s Alpha, marking one of the most significant legal setbacks in the company’s dramatic downfall. The myth of India’s innovation engine Once hailed as the future of Indian innovation, BYJU’s now serves as its cautionary tale. What began as a symbol of national pride, the story of a small startup that conquered global markets, has become a lesson in how hype and ego can outpace substance. In one of his last public interviews, founder Byju Raveendran dismissed the crisis, determined that he would see success again, saying,“Why I am confident of a comeback is that the most valuable thing I had is still with me,” referring to himself. It was a statement that perfectly captured the misplaced faith that defined BYJU’s rise, a belief not in innovation, governance or results, but in personality and perception. For years, U.S. investors, from BlackRock and UBS to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a single man and his myth, while American innovators back home struggled to break into markets dominated by foreign-backed giants. The question now is unavoidable: If so many investors were willing to stake billions on a person halfway around the world, why are they unwilling to back the homegrown entrepreneurs and talent right here in the United States, those who are locked out of markets increasingly monopolized by global capital and offshore influence? BYJU’s collapse is more than the downfall of a company; it is a mirror held up to a global investment culture that prizes narrative over national interest and speculation over stewardship. It is a reminder that the same investors who helped inflate the illusion of India’s innovation miracle have ignored the innovators in their own backyard. In the end, BYJU’s didn’t just fail as a business, it exposed the moral and economic blind spots of an era. The myth of India’s innovation engine has once again met the hard truth of execution and the cost was paid not only in rupees, but in large amounts of misplaced American capital.

Title: A $5 billion deal key to CoreWeave's AI empire just lost another investor's support

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave — the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power — needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share — a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization — more than three times its value after the IPO — and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 — enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year — demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

A Dublin man who was working in Texas while on a J1 visa has died following a road incident last Friday night. John Kirby, who was in his early 20s, is understood to have been knocked down by a truck in Austin, Texas. Mr Kirby was a business and marketing graduate. He suffered serious head injuries and was brought to a nearby hospital after the incident but died last Wednesday. The south county Dublin native had been in Texas with three Blackrock College schoolfriends. Blackrock College Rugby Football Club (RFC) paid tribute in a social media post. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they are “aware of the case and are providing consular assistance.” The director of Blackrock College RFC, Michael Hearty added his condolences saying it is with “deep sadness” that he shared the news of the passing. Mr Hearty said that Mr Kirby was a “much-loved member” of the Blackrock College RFC family, and his loss has been felt “profoundly” across the club and all teams. He continued: “I first met John in the summer of 2019 during preseason training. Immediately I was drawn to his infectious personality and big smile. He was charismatic, witty and very popular. “From the moment he pulled on the Rock jersey, he embodied everything our club stands for, commitment, friendship, and heart. He was a talented player, a dedicated team-mate, and above all, a guy who brought joy to everyone around him.” The director explained that Mr Kirby had that “special kind of presence”. “A big, infectious smile and a quick sense of humour that could lift the whole dressingroom. Whether it was during training on a horrible wet Tuesday night or over a pint in the clubhouse, he had a way of making people laugh and feel included. He was the sort of team-mate you were always happy to see walk through the door,” Mr Hearty noted. “His kindness, and sense of fun left a mark on everyone who knew him. The word no, wasn’t in his vocabulary.” His funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.

Title: Trump looks to cement his architectural legacy as Democrats bristle

Watch CBS News Updated on: October 17, 2025 / 4:52 PM EDT / CBS News Benjamin Leon Jr. hustled to a White House security checkpoint Wednesday night. He was running late for a dinner recognizing financial backers of President Trump's new ballroom construction project. Secret Service officers waved Leon and his wife through. Once inside, Leon, a wealthy Florida businessman and Mr. Trump's nominee for ambassador to Spain, joined an exclusive guest list of about 130 that included Nvidia's Ned Finkle, Extremity Care's Oliver Burckhardt, Boxabl's Paolo Tiramani and Galiano Tiramani and Coinbase's Kara Calvert. Representatives from companies that gave major contributions to the ballroom were on the list, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and Apple executive Nick Ammann, sources told CBS News. Some guests arrived in black SUVs with a security team. After a meal of tomato salad, Beef Wellington, and butterscotch ice cream with a pear jam-filled meringue, donors "mobbed" Mr. Trump, seeking a quick conversation or a cellphone photo, attendees told CBS News after the event. Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either. But Mr. Trump says his $250 million ballroom is fully financed — and that leftover money could be directed toward his next architectural endeavor: an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing. Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom — even if they're powerless to stop its construction. California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it. CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure. "This is the White House — it's an emblem of our nation," Takano told CBS News. "It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace." Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction. Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message. The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from "his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care," Takano said. Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. "For me, it's like – I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with." Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm. Aside from financial donations, companies have also made in-kind contributions. Carrier is donating a "world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come," according to a company statement. An unnamed firm committed $37 million in steel, Mr. Trump said. The ballroom, with bulletproof glass windows, will hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650 in July, Mr. Trump said. The footprint has "definitely expanded," and its exact square footage is "not yet settled," according to a source familiar with the layout. It was originally 90,000 square feet. That figure is likely to increase. The White House shared an abbreviated list of those invited to the dinner, but declined to disclose how much each person or company has given. CBS News obtained a full list of dinner guests. The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee confirmed earlier this month a probe of the ballroom's financing had commenced. "We need to know who is involved. Are foreign governments paying for any of this?" Rep. Robert Garcia told Meidastouch Network. The investigation is in a preliminary phase. In addition to exploring foreign donations, committee Democrats plan to scrutinize construction contracts, settlement money directed to the cause and whether donations lead to favors from government officials. Ballroom donations are being collected by the Trust for the National Mall, a charitable non-profit organization that partners with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House. A spokesperson for the Trust told CBS News the White House and National Park Service are responsible for construction and design. So far, the Trust has received no foreign donations for the ballroom, the spokesperson said. According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement. The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. At the dinner Wednesday, Mr. Trump held up three mock-ups of his next project, an arch on the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, across from the Lincoln Memorial. In 1902, the National Park Service considered building a triumphal arch on that site to honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built. Perhaps this time will be different. "Small, medium and large," Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the miniature models, which resembled Paris' Arc de Triomphe. "I happen to think the large looks by far the best." Here's the full list of invitees to Mr. Trump's dinner: More than 100 were invited to President Trump's dinner Wednesday night, which was meant to thank financial donors who are funding the new White House ballroom. Those invited, including some who couldn't attend, according to CBS sources, were: Kathryn Watson contributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Today’s top news: It’s been a long-standing joke: “Are the sellers in the room with us?” Well, it turns out: Yes, indeed they are. According to JPMorgan, the sharp crypto correction last week in crypto and carrying through this week was largely self-inflicted. In a note to clients, the bank said the sell pressure came from crypto-native investors, not institutions. The data backs that up: While open interest on Binance and other offshore venues cratered, CME’s institutional contracts barely moved. It’s very much a tale of two markets. Regarding on-chain crypto, the more than $19 billion in liquidations that slammed the crypto market on Friday have tremendously impacted sentiment and prices, neither of which have yet to recover. Glassnode shows nearly $12 billion in futures open interest evaporated overnight, the biggest single-day decline in dollar terms ever. Yet, institutional flow looks calm. The ETFs have seen steady inflows through the turbulence. Across the past two weeks: CME’s Bitcoin open interest held steady, ETF outflows were minor, and Coinbase volumes even ticked up, suggesting that institutional money (smart money) mostly watched from the sidelines. This was the crypto casino cleaning itself out, not TradFi calling it quits. The institutions have mostly still been buying through the pain —so who has been selling? Answer: ancient whales and 4-year cycle believers. There’s plenty of data showing the amount of Bitcoin sold this year from those ancient whales, many of whom were up billions. They said they were going to dump their coins on Wall St., and then they did. And then one of the biggest anecdotal takeaways from the Asia crypto conference tour last month was that many Asian whales still believe in the 4-year cycle, and fully planned on selling this year aligned with prior cycles. While this has put us in a painful spot, there are reasons to be optimistic. Couple those reasons along with the recent on-chain leverage flushout and you have a nice foundation to set up a healthier base for the next leg upwards—not to mention the prospective gold-to-Bitcoin rally that typically takes place when gold leads (and boy, is it leading right now). So stay the course, bulls—this too shall pass.

Title: Is BlackRock About To Go Public With Ripple And XRP? Here’s What We Know

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Rumors are circulating that BlackRock has partnered with Ripple to tokenize real-world assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). There has been no confirmation from either party, suggesting that these rumors may not be accurate. In an X post, XRP influencer JackTheRippler said that there are rumors that BlackRock is about to announce a partnership with Ripple to tokenize assets on the XRPL. Other XRP influencers, such as CryptoSensei and Bale, also shared the rumor, sparking excitement among XRP community members. However, BlackRock and Ripple have yet to issue an official announcement about the rumored partnership, suggesting these claims may not be true. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink confirmed that they are building their own technology to tokenize several of their funds and expand their crypto offerings. The BlackRock CEO noted that tokenization can help crypto-native investors access more traditional assets. He further remarked that if they could tokenize an ETF, they could get these investors into the more traditional long-term retirement products. Notably, the asset manager already has products, such as its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which runs on the Ethereum network. It is worth mentioning that Ripple already partnered with the fund’s manager, Securitize, to enable off-ramp support for BlackRock’s BUIDL using their RLUSD stablecoin. This has so far been the closest to a partnership between Ripple and BlackRock amid rumors that the asset manager plans to tokenize assets on the XRP Ledger. However, Ripple has so far helped advance upgrades to the XRP Ledger, which could compel institutions like BlackRock to tokenize their funds on the XRPL. This has included the launch of the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, which is designed to simplify the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). While rumors of a Ripple and BlackRock partnership do not appear to be accurate, there are other recent developments that provide a bullish outlook for XRP. This includes Ripple’s expansion into the corporate treasury markets through the $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, a provider of treasury management systems. As part of the deal, Ripple and GTreasury will focus on enabling customers to carry out real-time cross-border payments using Ripple’s payment solution, in which XRP serves as the bridge currency. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Ripple is also working to raise up to $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury company. The crypto firm plans to contribute some of its XRP holdings to set up the firm, while the proposed $1 billion is expected to be raised through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.35, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Fresh U.S. Office Conversion Fund Nears $1B in Investments
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/office-conversion-fund-peebles-mcneely/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T13:57:02Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If you build it, they will come — unless it’s stale office space. In Manhattan, for example, the office vacancy rate hovers at a high of between 13 and 14 percent — nearly doubling the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 — while apartments come with sky-high rents and spark bidding wars, creating a perfect storm for a switch-up. According to recent Cushman & Wakefield data, the pace of New York’s office-to-residential conversions has probably never been faster (or at least it’s close to that milestone). Enter another major player intent on capitalizing on the trend. In April, developer Don Peebles of the Peebles Corporation and Doug McNeely, previously a partner at BlackRock and at Carlyle, announced the Donahue Douglas asset management firm: a $1.5 billion venture to buy offices in New York and elsewhere in the U.S. to convert into housing or hospitality. Office-to-residential conversions are not a new phenomenon, but the national scale of Donahue Douglas marks a major shift from firms or funds focused on a single conversion project or one specific region. “Most of my entire career has been focused on developing cities,” said Peebles. “We’re not going to go to New York City or Washington, D.C., and buy one building; we’re committing to these markets.” Together, McNeely and Peebles plan to buy and transform office buildings across U.S. cities, including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Boston. The fund could spur at least $4.5 billion in apartment redevelopment, creating roughly 15,000 housing units, said Peebles. Additionally, Donahue Douglas is launching an emerging developer fund, with hopes to eventually employ minority developers for office conversion projects. “This is a long-term business for us,” said McNeely, “The secular headwinds that exist in office space right now, with structural shifts post-COVID, have created a real generational opportunity to invest in this space.” Since the pandemic, thousands of vacated office buildings have undergone makeovers, transforming into much-needed housing complexes. The United States reported a lineup of 55,300 office-to-residential units last year, with some 70,700 conversions planned for 2025, according to Yardi Matrix data. In New York City, notable office-to-residential conversion projects include the historic Emmet Building at 95 Madison Avenue and the Financial District’s newly opened 25 Water Street, the country’s largest conversion of its kind. Outside of New York City, developers from Detroit to Boston are seeking new opportunities in old buildings. These opportunities have ripple effects. “Putting capital and repositioning these buildings either turns around a neighborhood or prevents the neighborhood from ever facing issues with dark and vacant buildings and storefronts,” said Jeremy Shell, a principal with New York-based developer TF Cornerstone (who is not involved in the new fund). As of October, McNeely and Peebles were in the process of closing various commitments totaling nearly $1 billion of their planned $1.5 billion fund, said Peebles, who anticipates closing on that $1 billion by the first quarter of 2026. Different investors have jumped on board, including large institutions such as state pension plans, as well as family offices, university endowments and high-net-worth individuals. Many institutional investors want to allocate significant funds between $100 million to $200 million each, said Peebles. Beyond any one investor, however, the fund has gained momentum by problem solving for the now. “In New York and many other markets, we have a housing crisis, and that is not only an affordable housing crisis — that is a general residential housing crisis,” said Shell. While many New Yorkers can anecdotally understand housing complaints, the statistics hammer home the point. Nationally, there’s a shortage of some 7 million affordable housing units and 4.5 million market-rate ones. In New York specifically, there’s little ground-up construction of multifamily apartments. Moreover, building costs have increased alongside spiking interest rates, inflation concerns and tariff uncertainties, said Shell. To address this staggering lag, state and local officials have enacted policies such as a major rezoning of Midtown South to incentivize office conversions, and a long-term property tax break known as 467-m. Such moves highlight a key player in pulling off large-scale office-to-residential conversions. “That’s really step one: the city getting behind creating or recreating these buildings,” said Andrew Barrocas, CEO of MNS Real Estate (who is also not involved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). But policy alone is not enough to pull off nationwide conversion projects. Rather, a workforce tax credit program and financial incentives are crucial to producing more housing. Tax credit programs allow Peebles and McNeely to create a range of housing, from affordable to higher-end luxury apartments, depending on each building, said Peebles. Meanwhile, Congress earlier this year modified the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, making the production of affordable housing more attractive to developers, and tax credits easier for them to use. The closure of all kinds of offices has exposed the potential for a fund like the one proposed by Peebles and McNeely. Empty offices in New York City have caused small businesses to shutter, while those in Downtown Washington, D.C., have created something of a ghost town, snowballing into vacant retail and the closure of small businesses. Washington, D.C., therefore tops the list of Donahue Douglas’ geographic points of interest, as the firm’s investment strategy focuses on large, major markets; strong, solid underlying fundamentals; significant distress; and entrepreneurial opportunities, said Peebles. “No. 2, we really see San Francisco as an environment of great opportunity,” said Peebles, who pinpointed the city’s politics and focus on crime and quality of life issues. He additionally cited Dallas, Austin, South Florida and Boston as areas with major conversion potential. Replacing offices with apartments can revive neighborhoods and create more vibrant, vital, economically resilient and equitable places, said Dan Kaplan, a senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. Across neighborhoods, Peebles and McNeely plan to purchase a combination of both healthy buildings and those under significant duress, said McNeely. Some of these offices will be more bare-bones buildings at the end of their physical and economic lives, while others will be newer skyscrapers that have lost their tenants. Peebles doesn’t consider New York City among Donahue Douglas’ top five cities. But its neighborhoods still present opportunities for both conversions and ground-up development projects through Donahue Douglas’ emerging developer fund. “Our business strategy will be the real estate investment strategy of the future,” said Peebles. “The institutional investors and institutional developers have proven that they can never meet the needs of the public when it comes to housing. … There’s a demand for a new class of developers and investors, and capital to go to them.” As for the New York City areas well positioned to benefit from office-to-residential changes? Barrocas singled out business-heavy neighborhoods like Midtown East and Midtown West. Neighborhoods like the Financial District, Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn are similarly prime for conversion projects. In Midtown, the Garment District is likewise ripe for office-to-residential changes, said Kaplan. Not only is the area accessible to the subway, but it also has loft-type buildings that are relatively easy to transform into apartments. Sure, the neighborhood is missing green spaces, said Kaplan, but those residential aspects are likely to arise after housing arrives. After all, “it’s faster to convert than it is to build new,” said Kaplan. Meaning, converting buildings can — and likely will — revive neighborhoods more efficiently than new construction. (Another bonus: Conversions are also the more sustainable option, as concrete and steel are major sources of embedded carbon.) For proof, take Manhattan’s Financial District circa the 1990s. Back then, the neighborhood was predominantly offices. After an early 2000s recession and the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the values of those office properties declined. Plus, city zoning reforms in the previous decade — among tax incentives and lower-priced office buildings — spurred the conversion of larger offices, said Francis Greenburger, CEO and founder of Time Equities (and uninvolved in the Peebles-McNeely venture). “When you have vacant storefronts, vacant buildings, less pedestrian traffic around these buildings and neighborhoods, there’s risk of this downward spiral, and we’ve seen it,” said Shell, whose TF Cornerstone was responsible for various FiDi conversions. Once housing moved into the Financial District, so did shops, cafes and restaurants to feed and entertain those new residents. Neighborhood residents require everything from garbage pickup to quieter streets, as well as supermarkets, restaurants and cultural venues. “It takes a long time for the locations to provide the sort of infrastructure that residential tenants want,” said Greenburger, who believes the trend of conversions could potentially taper off within the next two to three years, once suitable office buildings are all scooped up. “Changing the office buildings isn’t the entire equation.” Nor is doing away with workspaces altogether. “As it pertains to New York City, we’re being very innovative,” said McNeely. “So, we’re going to couple conversions with smart working spaces. [We will] take 21st-century working spaces, where people are going to be very interested in not only living in the building, but also taking part in the neighborhood. We really want to focus on not only the building, but the amenities within and surrounding the building.” Anna Staropoli can be reached at astaropoli@commercialobserver.com.

The withdrawal contributed to a brutal Thursday across Bitcoin ETFs, which collectively bled $530.9 million, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock's IBIT lost $29.5 million, Fidelity's FBTC dropped $132 million, and Grayscale's GBTC shed $45 million, pointing to a broad institutional retreat from Bitcoin exposure. The week proved punishing for Bitcoin products overall, with $858.7 million in net outflows and only Tuesday breaking the exodus with a single day of inflows. The exodus comes as markets continue to absorb shocks from President Donald Trump's 100% tariff announcement on China last Friday, which triggered the largest liquidation event in crypto history with $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out within 24 hours. China on Thursday nodded openness to trade talks while accusing the U.S. of creating "panic" over Beijing's rare earth export controls, offering a potential off-ramp as both nations work toward a planned meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. "There is a short-medium term shift, especially post the comments on last Friday towards a more risk-off state, especially given market exuberance across risk assets and uncorrelated assets over the last few months," Ganesh Mahidhar, Investment Professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. The combination of the Ethereum-based USDe stablecoin’s depeg on Friday and a social media-driven boycott movement against Binance has pushed concerns about systemic risk back into focus, particularly at this stage of the post-halving Bitcoin cycle, he added. Despite managing just 50,000 BTC versus BlackRock's 800,000 and Fidelity's 210,000, ARKB "is generally one of the funds leading the charge" on outflow days, Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive, told Decrypt, adding how "ARK's holdings have held consistently in the 40-50K BTC since March 2024." ARK's fund sees "investors more frequently rotate in and out of BTC as a speculative asset" compared to BlackRock and Fidelity's vehicles, which house longer-term holders, he said. Whether the Bitcoin ETF outflow streak continues depends on upcoming catalysts, particularly the Federal Reserve's October 29 FOMC meeting and the ongoing Q3 earnings season, Mahidhar said. “Market exuberance needs to be supported by revenue and cash flow growth in U.S. markets — if that happens and the FOMC meeting goes well, we may see a staunching in the bleed out,” he noted. Bitcoin is trading at $104,629, down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, still nursing losses from the tariff-triggered crash.

Title: BlackRock Plans Tokenization as IBIT Surpasses $100B in AUM and $HYPER’s Presale Reaches $23.9M

Time Published: 2025-10-17T09:02:28Z
Full Content:
Quick Facts: 1️⃣ BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT surpassed $100B less than two years after its release on January 11, 2024. 2️⃣ Larry Fink announced a long-term plan to tokenize all assets, from funds to stocks and cash. 3️⃣ Fink argues that bubbles don’t impact long-term investors and that time in the market outweighs opportunistic buy-ins. 4️⃣ Bitcoin’s Layer 2 project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) reaches $23.9M in presale and eyes a Q1 2026 release. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) just surpassed $100B in assets under management (AUM), which prompted CEO Larry Fink to announce the company’s tokenization plans. Fink made the comments during a CNBC interview, where he said: I do believe we’re just at the beginning of tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board. —Larry Fink, CNBC Interview This comes over a year and a half after BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, on the Ethereum network by partnering with Securitize. In the official press release, Securitize’s co-founder and CEO, Carlos Domingo, said that BUIDL proves that tokenization is essentially unstoppable and that it will transform the capital market. With over $1T in AUM, BlackRock’s decision to invest in tokenization tech stems from Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s success, especially amid 2025’s rampant adoption wave. This spells good news for Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $23.9M presale which feeds Bitcoin’s coming Layer 2 with a projected Q1 2026 public launch. Fink believes that asset tokenization is imminent and the key step to attracting digital investors into the TradFi market, which pack more unpopular products like retirement funds. The overarching goal is to allow investors to hold multiple assets together, including funds, cash, and cryptos, which would represent a turning point for the capital market as a whole. To that end, Fink pushes for ‘time in the market,’ as opposed to opportunistic buy-ins, as an anti-bubble strategy. As he sees it, it’s only opportunistic buyers who push the notion of financial bubbles due to their short time in the market. This doesn’t happen with long-term investors who ride the bubbles to follow the larger trend. If you put money to work on January 1st, 2000, a year later you had the Dot Com crysis, six years later you had the financial crisis, you had the COVID crysis; you still would’ve made 8% compound interest over the entire 25 years. It’s not about if our markets are going up or down […] it’s about being in the market for the entire cycle. —Larry Fink, CNBC interview The same mindset applies to the digital market and Bitcoin is the living proof of that. While opportunistic snipers often find themselves in hot waters – last Friday’s market crash anyone? – long-term investors who bought $BTC in 2011 are now up 169,000,000%. Bitcoin’s recent performance only adds to that. $BTC now trades at just under $106K after a 13.7% drop over the last week, which is painful for leverage traders, but neutral for long-term investors, because Bitcoin will eventually bounce back. Especially with Bitcoin Hyper just around the corner. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to address Bitcoin’s most pressing problem: its performance limitation. With a hard cap of seven transactions per second (TPS), Bitcoin currently ranks 22nd on the list of the fastest blockchains by TPS. This translates to slow confirmation times, high fees, and lack of scalability. Hyper relies on tools like the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to change that. Once the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms incoming transactions in milliseconds, the Bridge then mints the bitcoins on the Hyper layer, allowing you to use the wrapped assets with near-instant finality within the Layer 2 ecosystem. Long-term, Hyper aims to turn Bitcoin into a more feasible option for institutional investors by making the network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. The project is seeing outstanding investor support, managing to reach $23.9M since its beginning and it’s still growing fast. $HYPER is available right now at the presale price of $0.013125, which could be the lowest you could ever buy the token at.

Title: AIP, MGX, BlackRock’s GIP consortium to buy Aligned for $40bn

A consortium consisting of the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), MGX, and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) has agreed to acquire Aligned Data Centers for an enterprise value of around $40bn. The deal will help increase the scale of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more Aligned’s current owners Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) and its co-investment partners will sell their entire equity stake. In an interview with Reuters, MAM head Ben Way said the sale “was not a warning sign for the sector or AI”. Way was quoted by the news agency as saying: “We don’t own businesses in perpetuity, we have owned this for seven years and it’s at a great spot to exit and there’s clearly massive demand to exit.” The acquisition is AIP’s first investment as it pursues its goal to deploy $30bn in equity capital, with a longer-term target that could reach $100bn when including debt. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Aligned Data Centers operates hyperscale and enterprise data centres and currently manages a portfolio of 50 campuses and over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Its facilities are located in major digital gateway regions in the US and Latin America, including Chicago, Dallas, Northern Virginia, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Santiago, Sao Paulo and Queretaro. Aligned will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and its current executive team from its Dallas headquarters following acquisition. Schaap said: “Partnering with the consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data centre infrastructure.” Since Macquarie Asset Management’s initial investment in 2018 via Macquarie Infrastructure Partners IV, and an increased stake through Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V in 2020, Aligned has expanded from two facilities with 85MW of capacity to its current scale. The company introduced both green securitisation and sustainability-linked financing models to the data centre sector during this period. The acquisition is intended to provide Aligned with capital and resources required to expand its presence and meet demand for high-density, scalable compute infrastructure. The consortium’s investment brings operational experience across AI infrastructure deployment and management. AIP chairman and BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink said: “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilising private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” Subject to regulatory clearance and standard closing requirements, the deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026. AIP was established by BlackRock, GIP, MGX, Microsoft, and Nvidia, with the objective of scaling AI infrastructure capacity.

Posted on 10/16/2025 9:30:56 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Unless Bitcoin upgrades its core cryptography in the next five years, the trust it has built over 16 years could be wiped out by a single quantum attack. Urgent upgrades are needed to protect the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto changed how we define money. In response to the 2008 collapse of the financial institutions in which millions put their trust, Satoshi created a decentralized monetary system built on elliptic curve cryptography. This combination of cold math and decentralization was a powerful one, attracting not only diehard skeptics but also the world’s largest financial institutions, such as BlackRock. In the 16 years of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. All of that is about to change very soon, however, with the advent of quantum computing. This is the biggest single threat to Bitcoin since its inception from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Once firmly in the realm of science fiction, quantum computers have become so advanced that they could plausibly rip through Bitcoin’s cryptography within five years or less. Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

The idea is to introduce new address/script types that verify PQ (or hybrid PQ+Schnorr) signatures, then let users move coins into those addresses. That can be done via a soft fork. ￼ How it would work • Add PQ signatures to Script/Taproot. Two well-discussed paths are (a) re-adding OP_CAT so wallets can use Lamport / hash-based signatures in Taproot script paths; or (b) a dedicated opcode (e.g., “OP_SPHINCS”) to verify SPHINCS+ (hash-based) signatures directly. Both are soft-forkable and let funds hide a PQ spend path today, then use it when needed. ￼ • New “quantum-resistant” addresses. BIP-360 (P2QRH) proposes address types that use NIST-standard PQ signatures (e.g., Dilithium or SPHINCS+), optionally in hybrid mode with current Schnorr, so the network can migrate gradually. ￼ • Standards exist. NIST finalized PQC standards in 2024 (FIPS 203/204/205), including CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS+ for signatures—natural candidates for Bitcoin if/when adopted. ￼ 7 posted on 10/16/2025 10:23:45 PM PDT by NoLibZone [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind And we are just five years from flying cars, too.

When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

Some, like quantum pundit Michele Mosca, predict it might even be possible as soon as next year. Government agencies like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security Agency are aiming to fully transition to quantum-secure standards by 2030. Yet the Bitcoin community appears confined to theoretical solutions, like BIP-360 (Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash) or commit-delay-reveal schemes. The time for theorizing is over. If concrete steps to adapt the Bitcoin blockchain aren’t taken now, Bitcoin’s entire $2.2-trillion market cap could go up in smoke. All it would take would be one compromised wallet or botched transaction to erode 16 years of painstakingly built trust. The rise of supercomputers This year’s real breakthrough was Microsoft’s Majorana chip, which accelerated the timeline to creating a truly useful quantum supercomputer from decades to years. In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes.

In simple terms, it did so by paving the way to scalable and stable quantum systems — two of the key issues standing in the way of this technological miracle. Fast forward a few months, and we currently find ourselves with around 100 quantum computers operating in the world already. McKinsey estimates there will be 5,000 by 2030. These computers aren’t just faster than the machines we’re all used to — they’re an entirely new breed of computer that runs calculations in parallel instead of in sequence. This is lethal to classical cryptography, like the ECDSA algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s private keys. At least 30% of Bitcoin, or around 6.2 million coins, are currently sitting in pay-to-public-key (P2PK) or reused P2PK-hash addresses, which are particularly vulnerable to this quantum threat. A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late. Prepping for Q-Day “Q-Day” is the term given to the day that quantum computers are finally ready to break traditional cryptography. When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

When this day comes, Bitcoin transactions validated and secured today, or even 10 years ago, could still be vulnerable because blockchain is fully transparent, and the data remains permanently accessible on this ledger forever. On top of this, bad actors are already collecting encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, in a move dubbed “harvest now, decrypt later.” It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that several attacks could happen simultaneously across the globe when Q-Day comes. When this happens, Bitcoin better be ready. A post-quantum future The problem with upgrading an entire blockchain from legacy to post-quantum cryptography is that it would require a hard fork, which has become almost a taboo subject in crypto communities. This huge step could break the UX, fragment liquidity, risk splitting the network and potentially alienate diehard OGs. There are alternatives: hybrid solutions that focus on securing transactions first and foremost without touching the base layer, layered security models and quantum-secure key management, and infrastructure that can prepare Bitcoin for the onslaught that is certainly coming. It isn’t a quick fix. Especially considering how conservative and slow-moving Bitcoin has been historically. Unfortunately, there is no longer any time to waste. Decisions must be made and solutions must be chosen because Bitcoin won’t survive as it is in a post-quantum future. Satoshi gave the world a new monetary system but never said it couldn’t evolve. Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency.

Now it’s up to the community to make the choice to evolve it and prepare for Q-Day, rather than waiting until it’s too late. It’s not quantum that’s the most significant risk to Bitcoin — it’s complacency. Gold and silver are not hackable. Real stores of value for millenia. I’ve read some stuff that says we have already reached Q-day. The govt will hold it back until they can unleash it so they are in control. Q-day will change the world. Nothing will be safe. The Russians have already started going back to pre computer days for some of their most secretive stuff. Back to paper and physical couriers. It’s coming. Or may alaresdy be here. The govt would definitely hold this info back. Could anyone here imagine how the general population would react if they knew none of our info was safe. Nothing.
