We recently compiled a list of the 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks. Power needs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are expanding so rapidly that some data center campuses may use more electricity than entire cities, or even states, CNBC reports. Here is what Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers had to say about technology companies: "Technology companies are in a “race of a lifetime to global dominance” in artificial intelligence. It’s frankly about national security and economic security. They’re going to keep spending because there’s no more profitable place to deploy capital”. READ NOW: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News As such, it is important to note that renewable energy isn’t going to be enough to meet their power needs. According to developers, natural gas will also have to play a role. In turn, this need will slow down the progress towards meeting carbon dioxide emission targets. Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure, and power resources for such facilities, further reveals how data center companies have already begun operating at a scale where they have started “tapping out against the existing utility infrastructure”. In other news, Uber is reportedly building a fleet of gig workers for labeling data for AI models. The new data labeling division, known as Scaled Solutions, will have workers complete projects for the company's internal business units as well as serve outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to a report from Bloomberg. The ride-hailing company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the U.S., Canada, and India, among others. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 On November 25, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC), known as the search-focused AI company, announced that it is expanding its partnership with Amazon Web Services. The expanded partnership will leverage AWS’s latest generative artificial intelligence (AI) services. Through the collaboration, Elastic N.V.

Today’s integration simplifies the collection of metrics and logs from Amazon Bedrock, in turn streamlining the process of gaining valuable and actionable insights.” Overall ESTC ranks 11th on our list of the buzzing AI stocks that are making headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Fund Achieves 131,000% Lifetime Return
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/pantera-capitals-bitcoin-fund-achieves-131000-lifetime-return/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T15:16:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has revealed in a new post that its Patnera Bitcoin Fund’s lifetime return has recently topped 131,000% net of fees and expenses after the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged to near $100,000 after the US elections. In the post, Pantera Capital’s CEO Dan Morehead shared an email forecasting back in July 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at $65, that the “bitcoin washout happened” and predicting the price of the cryptocurrency would surge over time. The email notes he was going to “buy 30,000 bitcoins” with his own personal money at a time in which the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $740 million. Given the small size of the cryptocurrency market at the time, Morehead noted that in 2013-15, the fund “bought 2% of the world’s bitcoins.” To Morehead, buying Bitcoin at the time was like “buying gold in 1000 B.C.” as then “99% of the financial wealth has yet to address bitcoin.” He noted that the industry has made progress and now believes 95% of the financial wealth “has yet to put their full-sized position on.” The CEO added that the catalyst for the figure to keep on dropping has “just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States” at a time in which massive “institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. “ As a result, he predicted the price of Bitcoin will move to $740,000 per coin, up from its current level around $95,000. The surge would see Bitcoin’s total market capitalization hit $15 trillion, which to Morehead isn’t an inconceivable number relative to the $500 trillion in financial assets. Per his words if Bitcoin’s price growth were to continue it would hit the $740,000 mark in April 2028. Featured image via Unsplash.

Title: Bitcoin Well On Track To Hit $740,000 By April 2028 — Pantera CEO
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-well-on-track-to-hit-740000-by-april-2028-pantera-ceo/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T13:10:51Z

Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital — the first crypto fund in the United States — is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin could smash $700,000 in 2028, roughly a week after the flagship crypto rocketed toward a six-digit price. Despite Bitcoin’s astronomical growth in recent months, Morehead thinks it’s “still early” for BTC and that the cryptocurrency’s bull market has yet to run. Dan Morehead noted in a Nov. 26 blog post that 5% of financial wealth is now exposed to Bitcoin. Yet, that figure is set to increase with more regulatory clarity in the U.S. as pro-blockchain president-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House. This would result in faster institutionalization of Bitcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started a “massive transformation,” posited Morehead. “It’s [Bitcoin] already done three orders of magnitude,” Morehead wrote. He revealed that his investment company’s crypto-focused Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which was launched in 2013, has notched an over 131,000% lifetime return on its first Bitcoin purchase at $7. “Another one seems plausible.” Per the Pantera CEO, Bitcoin has been on a trendline that will push its value to roughly $740,000 by April 2028 (a nearly 670% growth from the current price point) if it continues its growth pattern. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was trading for about 2.3% higher at around $95,294 at publication time. “I just can’t help thinking that we still have many more years of very compelling returns.” $740,000 is “not an inconceivable number, relative to $500 trillion in financial assets,” he explained. At this price, Bitcoin would boast a market capitalization of a whopping $15 trillion. “I can imagine an investor thinking: ‘Bitcoin has doubled this year. Well, I guess I missed it,’” Morehead said. “That’s the wrong mindset.” Furthermore, Morehead told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Nov. 27 that he doesn’t think Bitcoin could ever crash to zero now as it has reached “escape velocity” with 300 million investors around the world owning it.

Status: Brought to market in April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €3.6 million. It was sold in September for €3.2 million, according to the Property Price Register (PPR). Architectural gems are my thing, and houses right beside the sea would also (imaginary budget allowing) most definitely be my thing. The Lake House in Howth is a place of absolute wonder, hemmed between its own lake and the endless stretch of Burrow Beach, which overlooks Ireland’s Eye. The back garden is knitted into the dunes, with specific decks on which to enjoy a tipple of your choice. It also has an outdoor terrace at the end of the extensive living area that faced west to catch sunsets; the roof of the terrace was carved in the shape of a keel, to honour the owner’s legacy of sailing. Inside, the living areas are well considered, with a long sittingroom graduating into a Snaidero kitchen. The house splits into two levels, with a study set between them on the landing. The views from The Lake House over the sea were staggering, and it was clear that the previous owner had loved every minute of living there. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: Listed in June 2024 at €1.75 million through Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes & Sherry FitzGerald Radford. Achieved in excess of its asking price, according to selling agent John Radford. It appears on the Property Price Register as having sold for €1.35 million in October 2024, which accounts for the house on one acre. The remainder of land, almost 27 acres, was sold separately. Situated along Wexford’s historic Norman Way, this Georgian residence dates all the way back to 1801. Though described on the National Built Heritage website as “a farmhouse”, the five-bedroom pile extends to a considerable 483sq m (5,198sq ft). Lying on almost 30 acres, the grounds have two paddocks, four stables and a hay barn likely to have attracted those who wish to entertain equestrian pursuits. In addition to its pristine condition, as owners who had lived there since 1997 had restored it fully to its former glory, there is a restored coach house, offering a large livingroom and games room. Add to this a 13m swimming pool and its proximity to a number of beaches and golf courses, along with access to fresh fish at nearby Kilmore Quay, and you can understand why it was on the market for such a short time. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: On the market through Sherry FitzGerald Catherine O’Reilly since October, seeking €695,000. Lynam Cottage has been my favourite house reviewed by The Irish Times this year, not just for its postcard-perfect exterior, light-filled interior and stunning surroundings, but for the fact that it introduced me to the story of its namesake – the author, journalist, linguist and administrator Joan (Shevawn) Lynam. Elizabeth Birdthistle’s research into Lynam, who bought and refurbished the cottage in the 1960s, painted a portrait of a fascinating woman who worked for Alfred Hitchcock, worked and wrote for various media outlets, and who was passionate about Basque independence and found herself banned from Spain for a time because of it. She put her knowledge of the region into a novel, The Spirit and the Clay, which she set during the Spanish Civil War. Lynam wrote her second book, Humanity Dick – a biography of eccentric TD Richard Martin – no doubt surrounded by the rolling Wicklow hills at the cottage. And today, following a thorough renovation by its current owners, Lynam Cottage is an idyllic retreat – the envy of writers and artists alike. It also incorporates some of my favourite interior features, such as a checkerboard floor at its entrance, skylights in the living areas and a window seat overlooking the countryside. Read our full review here. – Jessica Doyle Status: Brought to the market by Sherry FitzGerald seeking €10 million in September, and went sale-agreed that month, according to the selling agent. The selling price has yet to be confirmed, and it has yet to appear on the Property Price Register. Hidden away down a long driveway off Sandycove Avenue East, this very private period home on three-quarters of an acre of gardens that run down to the sea is a few minutes’ walk from the Forty Foot and Joyce Tower. The 594sq m (6,394sq ft) five-bedroom villa-style detached house, built in 1840, was effectively rebuilt and completely modernised over the past 24 years. Inside, it’s all bright, modern and warm (it has a B3 Ber), with rooms opening on to terraces that look over the formal gardens to the sea. A separate two-storey studio mews is accessed from Sandycove Lane. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: On the market with Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since September, seeking €3.8 million. It may seem obvious to choose a very large period property in Rathmines as the home that stood out for me in 2024, but it wasn’t the sheer size of it or the Dublin 6 address that impressed me most, it was how the house was lived in. This six-bedroom home, measuring 410sq m (4,413sq ft), is set out over three floors, with every corner in use. For the last 22 years it has worked around family life, so there were no rooms that were kept out of bounds for visitors’ eyes only. The ground-floor level adapted to every stage, from toddlers to teenagers. The reception rooms are both refined and relaxed, with the shuttered sash windows facing out to Brookfield Tennis Club. And the beauty of it all is that number 5 has not lost an ounce of its period charm along the way. Here’s hoping it goes to another family that will fill each room with life and love. Read our full review here. – Alison Gill Status: Came to the market with Knight Frank in September seeking €2.1 million. Property is still on the market, but under offer. This semidetached end-terrace house was one of three Regency-style houses inspired by the developer Gerry Walsh’s love of the musical Oliver! and the famous Who Will Buy scene, set at a Regency terrace in Bath. To him, it symbolised beauty and harmony, and he sought to recreate homes with the same style and flair, taking years to assemble plots of land until he could build the terrace. Every corner, every space, every window and door was drawn and redrawn up to 200 times, and the meticulous attention to detail means every room, lobby and hallway works. The garden received the same exigent level of oversight, with each limestone slab on the patio individually chosen, pleached pear trees, and every bit of outside hardware, such as the downpipes, are of the highest quality. Walsh installed a Snaidero kitchen not just on the ground level, which has an open-plan kitchen, living and dining area and a pretty sittingroom to the front, but also in the utility room in the basement, along with a gym and home cinema. I particularly love the elegance of the stairs and its long mahogany banister running continuously over the house’s three floors. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: On sale through Knight Frank since October, seeking €7.75 million. Imagine the perfect weekend: your best friends are in Dublin to watch Ireland beat the All Blacks at the Aviva Stadium in Ballsbridge. After the match you repair to Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip’s pub The Bridge 1859 for a few celebratory scoops, followed by a steak dinner in Roly’s Bistro. Then it’s all back to your new abode at number 23 Elgin Road, where the party really gets started. This four-bed Victorian home in the heart of Dublin’s embassy belt, and done up to the nines by interior designer Jane Gilloway, is the perfect place for entertaining guests in style. You can put your friends and their families up in two luxury bedroom suites in the side extension, and in the two substantial detached modern mews houses at the end of the back garden. Gilloway has added plenty of showstopping touches to the elegant period home, including antique cast-iron radiators, Jacobean stained-timber floors and, in the kitchen/breakfastroom, Paonazzo honed marble worktops. With a spacious media room, pool table, fully equipped bar, wine room and integrated sound system, it offers all the ingredients for a marvellous party – and a luxurious lifestyle. Read our full review here. – Kevin Courtney Status: Brought to market by Sherry FitzGerald in June seeking €2.45 million. It went sale-agreed for over the asking price in August, says Michael Grehan of Sherry FitzGerald. An end-of-terrace Victorian five-bed with a pale pink exterior in an enclave of otherwise mostly redbrick homes off Rock Road, opposite Blackrock College, was at various times a school “for the education of young ladies”, a Protestant boarding house and also the home of a famous Irish bell-maker. It sold relatively quickly – overlooking Blackrock Park, the Dart line and the sea, its location was likely a strong selling point. Built in 1844, but Georgian in style, with bow windows and nearly floor-to-ceiling multi-paned new sash windows, Montereau had been modernised, with smart new bathrooms and kitchen – but there was still room to revamp the basement and a garage beside the house. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: Brought to the market in February 2024 with an asking price of €1.75 million. It was later listed at €1.5 million for auction, where it sold for €1.675 million according to selling agent Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty. This lovely two-storey, four-bay 260sq m (2,800sq ft) Victorian structure dates from 1895 and lies along one of the quietest roads in Sutton. It retains some unusual decorative embellishments of Indian accent, such as it ogee-headed arches to the veranda, as described on Fingal County Council’s record of protected structures. While its architectural origins have been lost to the annals of time, its Indian connection was presumed to be due to the fact that its first resident was a Dutch sea captain, with links to the Dutch East Indies and the East India Trading Company. And, although it would benefit from some upgrading, it has spectacular details such as elaborate window mouldings and striking cornicing. But what impressed most was its location, overlooking the sea with super views from rooms to the front. In addition, its southwesterly aspect allows for spectacular sunsets from these rooms, as the property is angled to maximise its expanse of views across Dublin Bay. It had been home to the Beshoff fish and chip family since 1978, until it sold earlier this year. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: For sale through Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since August, seeking €7.5 million. If you want to be lord of the manor in your own big estate, you usually have to head out to the countryside, but Tinnahinch is a classic country pile transplanted into the south Dublin suburb of Foxrock. This expansive Georgian-style home is built to the highest standards, with period features including Flemish bond facade, Portland stone sills and bespoke oak joinery. There’s a grand entrance hall and gallery landing, richly appointed reception rooms, spacious kitchen/diningroom and luxurious bedrooms. What really completes the idyllic picture is the 1.7 acres of lush gardens landscaped in the style of 19th-century Irish gardener William Robinson, who pioneered the move away from formal gardens to a wilder, more naturalistic style. The gardens are a magical mix of native and exotic plants, with winding paths, wooden bridges, tumbling waterfalls and serene lily ponds, with numerous spots to relax, read a book or dine al fresco.

Title: Crypto Oversight May Shift To CFTC Under Trump Administration: Report
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-oversight-may-shift-to-cftc-under-trump-administration-report/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T04:30:29Z
Full Content:
According to a report by Fox Business, citing sources familiar with the matter, the incoming Donald Trump administration may empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate certain crypto assets. With nearly two months remaining before Trump assumes the US presidency, the incoming Republican administration is already making strides toward fulfilling campaign promises, including creating a favorable regulatory framework for digital assets. The Trump administration is expected to significantly expand the CFTC’s role in overseeing the $3 trillion digital assets industry. This move could potentially scale back the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often faced criticism for stifling the growth of the digital asset sector by classifying most cryptocurrencies – apart from Bitcoin (BTC) – as securities. The SEC’s controversial “regulation-by-enforcement” approach has made the agency unpopular among US crypto industry participants. With the Biden administration ending, pro-crypto Trump’s incoming presidency signals a possible shift in Washington’s stance on digital assets. A recent ruling from a Texas court dealt a blow to the SEC by overturning its contentious broker-dealer rule. Sources suggest that the CFTC’s expanded role may include regulating digital asset exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies classified as commodities, such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, commenting on the matter, said: With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency. It is worth highlighting that Giancarlo is being considered for the nebulous “crypto czar” position under the Trump administration. According to the report, the new role is expected to “help execute crypto policy and potentially oversee an industry-led advisory council.” Beyond issues like immigration and trade tariffs, Trump’s campaign also focused on positioning the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” To support this vision, the president-elect is appointing regulators with moderate to positive views on digital assets. Asset managers like Bitwise and WisdomTree are optimistic that renewed interest in the digital asset industry could lead to the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for virtual assets such as XRP and Solana (SOL). Recent reports suggest that Trump’s transition team may create a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to tackle inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties. The idea has gained support from asset managers like BlackRock. Interestingly, similar efforts are underway globally. Brazilian federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced a bill to establish a national BTC reserve, aimed at diversifying the country’s treasury holdings.

Title: BlackRock in preliminary deal to buy private credit group HPS for $12 bln- FT

Investing.com-- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has entered a preliminary deal to buy HPS Investment Partners as the world’s largest asset manager looks to further grow its scope, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. BlackRock has a “handshake deal” with the firm, FT reported, with general terms of the deal to be announced after the Thanksgiving Holiday. A final price will be around $12 billion. HPS was considering an initial public offering that would have valued the firm at around $10 billion. The firm is one of the biggest private credit managers on Wall Street, and was founded by former Goldman Sachs employees in 2007. Wednesday’s report comes after BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion buyout of Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this year, the company had acquired UK data firm Preqin for around $3.2 billion. The asset manager is seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing private credit sector, given that alternative assets offer much more lucrative fees than traditional markets.

Title: Attor­ney Gen­er­al Ken Pax­ton Sues Black­Rock, State Street, and Van­guard for Ille­gal­ly Con­spir­ing to Manip­u­late Ener­gy Mar­kets, Dri­ving Up Costs for Consumers

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/27/2024 3:24:51 PM PST by george76 Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and Vanguard Group, three of the largest institutional investors in the world, for conspiring to artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices. Over several years, the three asset managers acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States, thereby gaining the power to control the policies of the coal companies. Using their combined influence over the coal market, the investment cartel collectively announced in 2021 their commitment to weaponize their shares to pressure the coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals. To achieve this, the investment companies pushed to reduce coal output by more than half by 2030. Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street utilized the Climate Action 100 and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative to signal their mutual intent to reduce the output of thermal coal, which predictably increased the cost of electricity for Americans across the United States. These firms also deceived thousands of investors who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits. Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” A coalition of 10 other States joined Attorney General Paxton on the lawsuit. The Buzbee Law Firm and Cooper & Kirk are serving as outside counsel.

Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” A coalition of 10 other States joined Attorney General Paxton on the lawsuit.

Crypto isn’t in the depths of a bear market, and your cousin doesn’t think you’re a crook anymore. Now crypto is ascending again—and everyone wants financial advice, just like Thanksgiving from three years ago. Below is a compiled list of handy talking points for your crypto-curious relatives, covering the industry’s most significant, recent developments. Stick to the facts, avoid shilling meme coins to the elderly, and you’ll be cruising to pie in no time. Bitcoin came within a few hundred bucks of the vaunted $100,000 milestone last week, and while the price has retreated a bit recently, it returned above $97,000 earlier Wednesday. What’s driving the demand that’s pushed Bitcoin’s price record in recent weeks? Institutional and retail investors have expressed optimism that there will soon be a more favorable regulatory climate for digital assets in the U.S. That’s thanks to the victory of self-proclaimed crypto enthusiast Donald Trump, along with the election of the most pro-crypto Congress to date. Meanwhile, institutional investors’ forays into spot Bitcoin ETFs have also given traders reason to be optimistic, pumping up the price of Bitcoin over the year. In short, Bitcoin is more “legit” than ever in the eyes of Wall Street and politicians. Your folks may have heard that BlackRock and Fidelity—which may be managing their pensions—are now involved in Bitcoin. What are these two Wall Street giants doing with crypto? Well, you can explain: They swallowed the orange pill. OK, so you probably don’t need to use Crypto Twitter jargon. Still, you can tell them that traditional finance bigwigs now offer exposure to the two largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Thanks to long-awaited SEC approvals this year, top fund managers who manage different ETFs now let ordinary investors buy shares that track the price of the two via brokerage accounts. Even your technophobic aunt can down the orange pill with a couple of taps on her phone. On the campaign trail this year, Trump made lots of promises about lots of things, including crypto. And while it remains to be seen whether he will live up to many of those commitments, signals are already indicating that he may be holding up the crypto end of the bargain—which could be a massive development for the industry. First things first: last week, the president-elect nominated Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary. Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has indicated he’d back Trump’s proposal to establish a Bitcoin federal reserve. The plan would see the U.S. buy billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to diversify its reserves. Think of it this way: If your uncle says Bitcoin has no real value, you might soon be able to tell him the U.S. government backs the asset. Pair that with Trump’s plans to unwind the SEC’s aggressive crypto crackdown completely, plus his oath to get the Republican-controlled House and Senate to approve laws that would firmly legalize most crypto activity swiftly, and it’s no wonder crypto has exploded in recent weeks. Experts say the market still has much, much higher to climb in the coming months, too. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, now has a role in Trump’s government: The Tesla CEO will lead the Department of Governmental Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) with billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to supposedly clear up the bureaucracy. What’s that got to do with crypto, though? Well, the new department’s acronym matches the ticker of Dogecoin, the original and most meme coin. That’s probably not a coincidence. Elon Musk has for years spoken—and tweeted—about how it’s his favorite coin. This earned him the “Dogefather” title on Twitter, now called X, after he acquired the platform. While we can’t be 100% sure of the naming origins, Trump is selling a DOGE-themed t-shirt featuring himself, Musk, and a Shiba Inu—the mascot of Dogecoin. Don’t want to decide between Bitcoin or Ethereum? If you’d instead launch your own token, you can now do it much more efficiently than ever. One of the most significant innovations from the most recent crypto cycle has been the creation of token launchpads, or platforms that allow anyone to near-instantly create a token with a few clicks and for a few cents worth of crypto. The most notable launchpad, Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform, has given rise to some of the most memorable tokens from this cycle. Nearly four million tokens have been created on Pump.fun this year, ranging from animal tokens that have provided early traders with significant riches to those launched by crypto-curious celebrities like musician Iggy Azalea. Crypto’s adoption barriers keep getting knocked down. Consumers now have a wide breadth of mobile app options to buy, sell, and interact with a variety of platforms. Plus, the rise in smart wallets, which drastically simplify the onboarding process, is making it easier to get those previously intimidated by the technical complexities of crypto to participate on-chain. With the launch of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, those looking to gain crypto exposure have more traditional financial options. That option didn’t exist in the U.S. last Thanksgiving. Are you looking to dive head-first into crypto? Not so fast—you’ll first want to get your sea legs. The crypto industry is rife with scams, and a seemingly innocuous link to an airdrop could lead you to a wallet drainer: Say goodbye to all your coins! Even if you manage to keep your crypto out of scammers' grips, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to keep your holdings from going to zero. Not many people make money trading crypto, and much fewer are getting rich off of it. Up to 80% of day traders lose money over time, according to a report published in The Journal of Finance. It’s still incredibly easy to lose your shirt in crypto, whether by clicking a malicious link or betting on highly volatile coins. For newcomers, you’re probably best suited to sticking to the most significant coins via apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, Cash App, or buying into ETFs. Want to go deeper? Be very careful—you’ll be thankful in the long run.

Title: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): Hedge Funds Boost Holdings Despite Nasdaq Delisting Risk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Should Not Ignore. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other AI stocks. Even as the United States pursues a tougher trade policy towards China, the latest indication being the tightening of export restrictions on advanced AI chips, companies from the Asian country continue to debut on the US stock market with elevated investor interest. For example, Pony AI, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology company, recently held an initial public offering that saw shares jump 15% in the market debut, pushing the valuation of the firm to more than $5.25 billion. News agency Reuters reports that the successful debut also suggested a positive investor approach to China-based firms.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Semiconductor Penny Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) stands against the other semiconductor penny stocks. With the age of artificial intelligence having made an indelible mark on the stock market, semiconductor stocks have been thrust into the spotlight. While it's typically the stocks at the top of the semiconductor food chain, such as the AI GPU designer whose shares are up 740% since ChatGPT was made public or the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer responsible for making AI GPUs or processors for Apple, that catch the media and public attention, the semiconductor industry is made of a plethora of other firms as well. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry comprises firms upstream and downstream of the chip supply chain. Starting from the former category, these semiconductor stocks start from those that provide design intellectual properties and hardware used to manufacture chips. Moving further downstream, semiconductor fabrication firms such as the Taiwanese firm whose American Depository Receipts (ADRs) have gained 133% since ChatGPT's public unveiling started to play a role. Finally, the downstream chip supply chain is made of designers who sell the products and others who assemble chips into the hardware needed for their proper functioning. To invest in semiconductor stocks, an investor needs to know which supply chain category a stock belongs to. This is because industry dynamics often have a varying effect on stocks at different rungs of the supply chain. Additionally, when we talk about downstream stocks, then the markets that they cater to also play a role in the share price performance. Stocks that are upstream are affected by broader industry trends and find it difficult to benefit from sector-specific tailwinds such as artificial intelligence. As an illustration, consider the performance of three upstream semiconductor stocks. The first stock ranks 7th on the list of 15 AI stocks shaping Wall Street, the second is 19th on Goldman Sachs' list of top growth investors, while the third ranked 12th and was losing popularity among institutional investors according to Bank of America. The first two stocks are up 16% and 4% over the past twelve months while the third is up by a more modest 1%. Compared to the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index, a widely followed industry benchmark that has gained 32.2% over the same period, all three semiconductor stocks have underperformed. A brief look at the three stocks' business model sheds light on the reasons behind their lackluster performance. Starting from the worst stock whose shares are up by 1%. The firm provides semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as those used in wafer cleaning, etching, and film deposition. This means that it has exposure to the broader and non-AI sectors of the downstream semiconductor industry as well. Additionally, during its fiscal year 2024, 42% of the firm's revenue came from the memory industry. These chips run parallel with integrated circuits in computers, and their demand has been depressed recently and only started to recover in mid-2024. It also has exposure to China, and semiconductor tensions between the US and China haven't boded well for the stock either. Similarly, the semiconductor stock that is up 16% over the past year also has notable exposure to China. During the nine months ending in July 2024, 40% of its revenue came from China. Yet, for the three months ending in July, this percentage dropped to 32% as US government restrictions against American chip firms from supplying products to China continued to affect it. This semiconductor firm provides products such as plasma abatement systems, epitaxy systems, film deposition systems, and etching masks. As a result, even if there are no US-Chinese tensions, the fact that China's economy and industrial production have slowed naturally reduces the demand for its products. On the downstream end of the semiconductor supply chain, there is a clear bifurcation between AI and non-AI stocks, or those with exposure to integrated circuits and GPUs, and those with no exposure. To understand how to consider two stocks of firms that manufacture semiconductors. The first is the Taiwanese firm which we've mentioned above. Its ADRs are up 87.2% year-to-date. The second ranks 16th on our BofA list shared above, and its shares are down 14.5% year-to-date. Starting from the former, during the third quarter, 51% of the firm's revenue came from high-performance computing (HPC) products. These chips are involved in data centers, enterprise computing, and other workloads, and they also have wide exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. This firm also manufactures AI GPUs for Wall Street's favorite GPU designer, and the culmination of its end markets coupled with the fact that its 3-nanometer manufacturing process is an industry leader has seen investor optimism surge surrounding its fortunes. On the flip side, the semiconductor stock whose shares are down 14.5% has little exposure to HPC and AI chips. As of H1 2024, 53% of the firm's $3.7 billion revenue came through products that it sold to the automotive industry. This firm is known for selling chips manufactured through silicon carbide. These chips are used to manage power in electric vehicles, and as EV demand has slowed down in 2024, investors have fled the stock in response. The semiconductor stock hasn't been helped by the fact that slowing industrial activity led to a 21% industrial revenue drop during H1. As should be clear by now, semiconductor stocks come in all flavors. One such flavor, when analyzing them through share prices, is the penny stock segment. These stocks belong to smaller companies that do not have sizable revenue to power their valuation. Yet, penny stocks, when prudently considered, also often have the chance for stronger returns due to their low prices. On the flip side, these stocks are prone to market manipulation, and since they're not as frequently covered by analysts or the media, understanding the fundamental drivers of their share price is complex. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some semiconductor penny stocks. Our Methodology To make our list of the best semiconductor penny stocks, we ranked semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks under $5 by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a technician's hands working on an advanced semiconductor substrate. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 10 AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is an upstream semiconductor firm that primarily makes and sells substrates. These products are used to manufacture chips on them, and AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s substrates revolve around communications, solar, robotics, and other associated applications. The stock has been on quite a ride this year. It fell by 37% in April after a research report alleged that the firm was facing tight financial conditions. AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s shares continued their downward momentum in November, as they fell by another 18% following a third-quarter revenue miss. While the firm raked in $23.6 million in revenue during Q3, analysts had expected it to bring in $25.5 million. Even though AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is based in California, 99% of the firm's long-term assets are in China. Additionally, 50.6% of the firm's H1 2024 revenue came from the East Asian country, which creates a double-edged sword. While AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) can benefit from renewed Chinese focus on its domestic industry, the firm might also be caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical tensions between the US and China. AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s management shared details about the state of its Chinese market during the Q3 2024 earnings call: "Overall, the market recovery is somewhat lumpy, particularly given the weak economic conditions in China. But new fiscal stimulus in China announced in September could provide a catalyst for a truly market environment. This will benefit demand across a broad based of applications, including power amplifiers, HPT applications for wireless switches, high-speed power industrial labels, and LEDs. We continue to be encouraged by our relatively new traction in HPT applications by bringing the learning from our product that’s advancing in our 8-inch gallium arsenide development to our 6-inch gallium arsenide wafer production." Overall AXTI ranks 5th on our list of the semiconductor penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AXTI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

More Info The FBI has been investigating a longtime Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) consultant over the contractor's alleged role in a hack-and-leak operation that targeted emails by environmentalists critical of Exxon Mobil’s role in climate change, Reuters has reported exclusively. The multi-year operation involved hackers who breached email accounts of environmental activists and others. The scheme allegedly began in late 2015, when U.S. authorities contended that the names of the hacking targets were compiled by the DCI Group, a public affairs and lobbying company working for Exxon at the time. For years, Exxon Mobil has been a target for climate activists. Two years ago, the company lost three board seats to Engine No. 1, an activist hedge, in a stunning proxy campaign. Engine No. 1 demanded that Exxon needs to cut fossil fuel production for the company to position itself for long-term success. "What we're saying is, plan for a world where maybe the world doesn't need your barrels," Engine No.1 leader Charlie Penner told the Financial Times. Engine No. 1 enjoyed a stunning victory thanks to support from BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and State Street who all voted against Exxon’s leadership. However, the backlash against Big Oil has faded in recent years even as the countries everywhere rush to beef up their energy security. In 2022, Exxon recorded a major victory after its shareholders supported the company's energy transition strategy at the annual general meeting. Only 28% of the participants backed a resolution filed by the Follow This activist group urging faster action to battle climate change; a proposal calling for a report on low carbon business planning received just 10.5% support while a report on plastic production garnered a 37% favorable vote. Following in the footsteps of its larger peer, Chevron Corp.(NYSE:CVX) shareholders likewise voted against a resolution asking the company to adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, indicating support for the steps the company already has taken to address climate change. Just 33% of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, according to preliminary figures disclosed by the company, a sharp turnaround from last year when 61% of shareholders voted to support a similar proposal.

Title: Gensler Exit Signals End To Climate Reporting Rule And ESG In The SEC

Full Content:
Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following a Financial ... [+] Stability Oversight Council meeting at the Treasury Department in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, May 10, 2024. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saw a wave of regulatory and enforcement actions relating to environmental, social, and governance; sustainability; and climate change. Gensler’s resignation as Chair of the Commission not only signals a new direction for the agency but will most likely result in many green initiatives being rolled back. The result will frustrate climate activists but may give U.S. businesses a strategic advantage in the global market. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions. On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. A series of companion rules and initiatives were also implemented during the same period. The SEC created a Climate and ESG Enforcement Task Force in March 2021 to “develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct.” The SEC quietly disbanded the Task Force in September 2024. In April 2021, the SEC Division of Examinations issued a Risk Alert relating to ESG. The Division conducts exams, their terminology for reviews of SEC filings of publicly traded companies and investment funds for compliance with regulations. They also issue periodic Risk Alerts making companies aware of areas of focus and concern. The April 2021 alert showed a new focus on ESG and stayed an annual priority until 2023, when it was quietly omitted. It returned in a November 4 Risk Alert that addressed ESG claims made by funds. This aligns with the Names Rule, amended in September 2023, to take into consideration ESG. Under the rule, funds with phrases related to environmental, social, or governance factors, including climate and sustainability, will be forced to align 80% of the investment with those names. This is most likely the reason why ESG was removed from priorities in 2023 and is now reemerging, as it gave funds time to adjust to the new rule. In 2024, the SEC penalized a number of high-profile funds for failure to comply with the rule. Under Gensler, the SEC has also introduced other initiatives relating to ESG, including a focus on the composure of boards and internal policies. The future of these initiatives is in question with Gensler’s exit. Traditionally, the Chair of the SEC tenders their resignation following a presidential election, even when they have time left in their term. This allows the incoming administration the ability to make their own selection for the role. As expected, Gensler, a Democrat that served under Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Biden, submitted his resignation on November 21, effective the end of Biden’s term. With Gensler’s exit, there will be a notable shift in priorities for the incoming chair. At the Workiva Amplify Conference in September, David Peavler, a former attorney for the SEC and current partner at Jones Day, addressed the impacts of the then potential change. He stated he believes that the Trump Administration will either drop or repeal the climate rules. Looking at the overall direction of the SEC, he believes there will be shift away from new initiatives and rulemaking, as has been the case under Gensler, and a refocus on enforcement. While ESG was a still relatively unknown concept during Trump’s first term, the Department of Labor did take action to limit its impact. In 2019, the DOL issued a rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that found the consideration of ESG by fund managers was a violation of their fiduciary duty. The Biden Administration partially reversed the DOL ERISA opinion in 2021, stating that ESG may be considered as a factor, but only as a tiebreaker if both investment opportunities offer identical returns. Expect a similar approach under the next Trump Administration. The next SEC chair will most likely methodically undo the ESG and climate related reporting standards imposed under Biden and Gensler. The SEC will refocus on traditional financial consideration, effectively killing ESG at the national level. Although, companies will still have to comply with international regulations and state level requirements. This may give U.S. businesses a strategic advantage in the global market. Concerns have been rising in the European Union that their corporate sustainability reporting requirements are harming the EU economy. Following the June 2024 Parliament elections, the incoming leadership has stated their intent to reduce the “regulatory burden” on businesses, including consolidating three key pieces of climate related regulations. Other jurisdictions have imposed costly reporting requirements under the IFRS Sustainability Standards. Climate activists argue the the costs are not only worth it, but are necessary to reduce the impacts of climate change in a shift towards a “climate economy.” However, the Trump administration has stated clear opposition to the concept and business as usual. The removal of the SEC sustainability/ ESG focus will allow U.S. businesses to continue to focus entirely on profits, giving them a competitive edge, at least in the short term. One Community.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/27/2024 10:29:08 AM PST by DFG A groundbreaking lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accuses financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street of colluding to manipulate the U.S. coal market. The case, spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and supported by 10 other state attorneys general, alleges that these firms have used their substantial ownership stakes in major coal producers to suppress competition and artificially raise energy prices. The states listed as plaintiffs are” Texas Alabama Arkansas Indiana Iowa Kansas Missouri Montana Nebraska West Virginia Wyoming According to the 108-page complaint, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street collectively hold controlling stakes in multiple coal companies, including Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, which account for significant portions of U.S. coal production. The suit alleges that these firms formed an “output-reduction syndicate,” leveraging their shareholder influence to force coal companies to cut production, ostensibly in alignment with environmental goals like the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. The complaint details how these firms’ actions have allegedly suppressed coal supply despite rising demand for electricity. The result? Skyrocketing coal prices and increased costs for consumers at a time when many are already grappling with inflation. (Excerpt) Read more at thegatewaypundit.com ...

Take everything they have and give it back to the American people. “Take everything they have and give it back to the American people.” You clearly don’t understand how mutual funds work. “collectively hold controlling stakes” The key word is hold. Those three companies don’t actually own the shares. The investors in the mutual funds are the owners. Bill Clinton made a national park in Utah (IIRC). It had a lot of coal in it. By taking this out of commission, other coal became more valuable. James Riady, friend of Bill, owned a lot of coal. This made him even richer than he already was. John Riady, son of James, is a Young Global Leader. Same as Musk, Gabbard, Haley, Cotton, DiCaprio, Macron, Trudeau, Zuckerberg, Brin and Ma. I wonder if the same legal path could be taken against their housing monopoly. I am not talking about the client funds. I am talking about the funds of those who run them. Obviously if the funds themselves are shut down then the clients would have to be able to cash out. Here in western Colorado, most of the coal burning plants are being phased out. Reducing coal mining production, I don’t know, but what i do see, daily, is four or five freight trains, close to two miles long, and coal tar trains, same, slugging their way through Glenwood Canyon, just waiting for a disaster.. i’m not anti-coal. I am anti- coal train numbers increasing through a twelve mile Colorado River I70 canyon where the detour route when canyon closes is 4+ hours either direction. And any spill here will destroy water supplies for multiple states down river “The key word is hold. Those three companies don’t actually own the shares. The investors in the mutual funds are the owners.” That is not how these Corporations are operating anymore. The “normal” is no longer normal. Really, do yourself a favor and watch this. It will change your understanding about how these three Corporations actually work. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxZO0jd8VoU Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: Bitcoin’s price has surged since Trump’s election – here’s why

Associate Professor and Director of the Centre on US Politics, UCL Thomas Gift holds shares in Bitcoin financial instruments. University College London provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners Bitcoin has soared to an all-time price high, but will it continue? Advocates of the world’s largest cryptocurrency hope its value will continue to soar when Donald Trump returns to the White House. After the price of bitcoin surged from approximately US$69,000 (£54,000) the day before the election on November 5 to nearly US$100,000 now. Bitcoiners are keeping their eyes focused on what happens next in US politics. Small wonder. As a candidate, Trump pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and said he would back a bitcoin strategic reserve, which would order the US to purchase and hold bitcoin for an indefinite amount of time. Trump even suggested that the US might one day pay off its national debt in cryptocurrency. Many of Trump’s future cabinet members and inner circle are reportedly pro-crypto, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he holds “most” of his net worth in bitcoin. With a bullish outlook, other Trump-aligned politicians are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has proposed the Bitcoin Act of 2024, which would increase the stash of US government-owned bitcoin and potentially shore up US supremacy in a budding geopolitical competition to horde the asset. The US holds roughly 203,000 bitcoin, or about US$21 billion, which it has largely accumulated through seizures from illicit holdings. It’s not just Washington getting into the act. In Texas, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, a pro-bitcoin non-profit, recently tweeted that he is in “discussions” to help introduce a bitcoin strategic reserve in the lone star state. Pennsylvania has also passed a new bitcoin “rights bill” and floated creating a strategic reserve. Some think this is game theory playing out. As states rush to buy bitcoin, it could create a “race to the top” that forces other government entities to join the blockchain. Aside from politicians’ promises, a number of other reasons explain why many bitcoiners are poising themselves for a Trump-fuelled bull run. One is the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will keep on printing money for the foreseeable future to finance America’s debt, which is currently about US$36 trillion and growing. Because the supply of bitcoin is finite – there will only ever be 21 million mined – it is often considered a hedge against runaway inflation. More available money funnelling into the scarce asset will necessarily drive up bitcoin’s price. Although numbers vary, one recent analysis by the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump’s economic proposals could balloon the federal debt by up to US$15 trillion over ten years. While leaders of the new Department of Government Efficiency, a consulting group that Trump is planning to create, have promised to “drain the swamp,” sceptics question if that’s possible when spending cuts on debt servicing, defence and entitlements such as social security and Medicare are all off the table. As an expanding supply of total dollars finds its way into finite assets like bitcoin, it becomes more expensive for consumers to buy. Another reason for bitcoin bullishness is that the Trump administration is expected to offer more regulatory clarity over the crypto industry. This doesn’t necessarily mean more deregulation, but rather outlining clearer “rules of the road” for how individuals and firms can trade crypto assets. Many bitcoiners, for example, have seen Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler, who once taught a class on blockchain technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as bad for crypto and quick to engage in arbitrary enforcement of SEC regulations. Gensler will step down down from his role on January 20 of next year, and a new Trump-appointed SEC chairman is likely to be more intent on expanding the crypto sector. A final variable pulling the price of bitcoin higher is greater institutional adoption by financial investment advisories and banks, pegged to recent SEC rulings. Earlier this year, after losing a court battle in 2023, the SEC was essentially compelled to approve “spot” bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are investment instruments that track bitcoin’s market price. These ETFs, more readily accessible to corporate as well as individual investors, have brought financial juggernauts such as Fidelity and BlackRock into the bitcoin space, signalling mainstream acceptance of the cryptocurrency. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, for example, has called bitcoin “digital gold” and a “legitimate” financial commodity. A looming question about bitcoin is the degree to which it remains a partisan issue. While Republicans have rallied behind bitcoin as part of an economic “freedom” agenda, many high-ranking Democrats have been more hostile. For instance, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has been described as carrying out an “anti-crypocurrency crusade”. However, other Democrats like New York Senator Chuck Schumer have sought to reduce federal restrictions on trading crypto assets. Republicans are trying to exploit their perceived advantage on the issue. Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for example, has insisted that the “crypto economy is here to stay”. Meanwhile, chief executives of major crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jockeying for a seat in Trump’s new proposed crypto council, which will advise the White House on policy related to crypto assets. If 2024 was the “crypto election”, the big unknown is whether Trump will really champion digital assets, or dash the hopes (and wallets) of bitcoiners everywhere.

Title: TuSimple co-founder demands liquidation, sues company for control of his shares | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Xiaodi Hou, the co-founder and former CEO of self-driving truck startup TuSimple, is demanding that the board immediately liquidate the company and return all remaining funds — roughly $450 million — to shareholders “on a pure pro-rata basis, regardless of share class,” according to a letter that TechCrunch has viewed. Hou is also suing TuSimple and his former co-founder Mo Chen, the company’s chief producer and director, to confirm that a 2022 voting agreement granting Chen control over TuSimple expired in November 2024, which Hou says would revert his voting rights back to him. Hou has even created a website, SaveTuSimple.com, to raise awareness about his campaign to liquidate TuSimple and return cash to shareholders — which include Traton Group, BlackRock, and Vanguard. The site states that as of November 26, TuSimple’s stock trades at $0.24 per share, while holding $1.93 per share in cash alone. It advertises that through liquidation, TuSimple shareholders “can immediately realize this 700%+ premium to current market price.” The letter, lawsuit, and campaign are the latest flare-ups in an ongoing fight between TuSimple and some of its shareholders, which include Hou, over the company’s attempts to send its remaining assets to China. Before shuttering its U.S. operations and delisting from the stock market earlier this year, TuSimple was a pre-revenue company, so any cash it has today would have come from investors. Hou and other shareholders have accused TuSimple’s leaders of diverting assets toward animation and gaming businesses linked to Chen, framing it as a business pivot. After shareholders raised concerns of self-dealing in an August letter to the board, TuSimple surprised many by unveiling a new AI-generated animation and gaming unit. Earlier this month, Hou urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order on TuSimple to stop the company from transferring U.S. assets to China as part of an existing shareholder lawsuit. Hou said he was galvanized to action after noticing filings that he says signaled TuSimple was preparing to transfer large sums of money to China. TuSimple has fought back against Hou, bringing up its own litigation alleging trade secrets theft after Hou launched his autonomous trucking startup, Bot Auto, in Texas last month. “As a founder who invested seven years building TuSimple Holdings Inc. and its largest shareholder, it has been disappointing to watch shareholders’ collective investment value plummet by over 91% in less than two years under the leadership of Mo Chen … and Chairman and CEO Cheng Lu,” Hou wrote in the letter, which he sent to the board on Monday. Hou filed suit against TuSimple and Chen last week in the Delaware Chancery Court, which is known to be friendly to shareholder rights. In the filing, he also asked the court to postpone TuSimple’s upcoming annual shareholder meeting, which is currently scheduled for December 20, to “prevent the implementation of proposed significant governance changes before the voting rights dispute is resolved.” Sources familiar with the matter say Hou wants time to solicit proxies to get more investors on his side. Aside from Hou and Chen, TuSimple’s largest shareholder, with an 11.8% stake, is Sun Dream, an affiliate of Chinese conglomerate Sina Corporation, an investment that brought scrutiny from federal regulators. The remaining large shareholders are Logistics giant Traton (7.6% stake); Vanguard Group (6.1% stake); BlackRock (5.6% stake); and Camac Partners (5.5% stake). Camac has also written to urge the board to keep TuSimple’s funds in the U.S. The other three investors did not respond in time to TechCrunch to comment. But before Hou can convince shareholders to back him, he’ll need to get control over his own shares, which are the subject of his lawsuit. In the fall of 2022, a probe from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States led TuSimple to reveal that its employees spent paid hours in 2021 working for Hydron — Chen’s hydrogen trucking startup based in China — and shared confidential information with the company. As a result, Hou was ousted from his posts as CEO, president, and CTO, and from his position as chairman of the board, though he retained a seat on the board. Hou has maintained that the firing was done without just cause. He and Chen were concerned that the board was engaged in a power grab that wasn’t in TuSimple’s best interest, so they discussed combining their voting powers to reinstate Chen on the board and bring Hou back as CTO after an internal investigation about the Hydron allegations. (Hou never got his CTO post back.) On November 9, Hou signed an agreement with Chen that would give the latter “irrevocable proxy and power of attorney” over Hou’s shares in TuSimple: Around 13.4 million shares of Class A common stock, and 12 million shares of Class B common stock. Put together, Hou’s shares would account for 29.7% of TuSimple’s total voting power. The agreement, which TechCrunch has viewed, expired after two years. Hou says this means the shares should revert back to him. But Chen has other ideas. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated November 9, 2024, Chen reaffirmed his claim to Hou’s shares, stating that he controls 57.9% of the company’s voting power. The filing also states that while the irrevocable proxy indeed terminated, “the voting agreement, and the voting arrangement thereunder, remain in full force and effect.” In other words, while Hou may be in possession of the shares, he still needs to vote as Chen directs. (It’s worth noting that since voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January, TuSimple has failed to file quarterly updates, which are required for a company that is still registered with the SEC. TuSimple is also attempting to deregister from the SEC.) TuSimple included similar language around the deal with Hou in its proxy statement to shareholders ahead of the upcoming annual meeting, during which they will vote on renewing the six current directors and whether to create a classified board, or a staggered board. Half of the board’s current makeup is TuSimple executives: Chen; TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu; and TuSimple COO Jianan Hao. The other three — James Lu, Zhen Tao, and Albert Schultz — are meant to be independent directors. If the second proposal were to pass, it would prevent shareholders from replacing the entire board in a single vote and it could entrench control with Chen, who would effectively be ensuring his preferred directors stay in place for the long term. A hearing to expedite the review of Hou’s complaint and to decide on his request to postpone TuSimple’s annual meeting is scheduled for December 2. TuSimple did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) -BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) have been sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. Wednesday's complaint filed in the federal court in Tyler, Texas, is among the highest profile lawsuits targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals, or ESG. The defendants were accused of exploiting their market power and involvement in climate advocacy groups to pressure coal companies to slash output and reduce carbon emissions from coal by more than 50% by 2030, driving up consumers' utility bills. "Competitive markets -- not the dictates of far-flung asset managers -- should determine the price Americans pay for electricity," the states said in the complaint. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street together have more than $26 trillion of assets under management. In a statement, BlackRock said any suggestion it invested in coal producers to harm them was "baseless and defies common sense. This lawsuit undermines Texas' pro-business reputation and discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." Vanguard and State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The 11 states also include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. Republicans have long explored using U.S. antitrust laws to target alleged collusion among investment managers to advance climate-related goals. Climate advocates, in contrast, view assessing environmental risks as essential to determining what investments are worth. BIG STAKES IN COAL COMPANIES The states objected to BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street allegedly pressuring coal companies for change starting in 2021. They also criticized the defendants' membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which says members are committed to complying with all antitrust laws, and BlackRock's and State Street's membership in Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+. Vanguard left the Net Zero initiative in 2022, while BlackRock and State Street left Climate Action 100+ in February. But the states said the withdrawals did not negate the "ongoing and future threat" of continued pressure. It cited the defendants' investments in nine coal companies, including combined respective stakes of 34.2% and 30.4% in Arch Resources and Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded U.S. coal producers. BlackRock was also accused in the lawsuit of "actively deceiving" investors about its non-ESG funds by promising to dedicate them to enhance shareholder value, when it allegedly used all its holdings to advance its climate goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office filed the lawsuit, in a statement accused the defendants of promoting an "illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized 'environmental' agenda." The lawsuit seeks to block the defendants from using their investments to vote on shareholder resolutions and take other steps that could undermine coal output and limit market competition. It also seeks civil fines for violating federal antitrust and Texas consumer protection laws. The case is Texas et al v BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 24-00437.

If the latter approach is the one you are taking, consider adding consumer staples giants, like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), to your collection of stocks. The consumer staples sector is filled with companies that provide consumers with the mundane things they use every day.

Title: Why Is Moderna, Inc. (MRNA) Among the Worst Performing Healthcare Stocks in 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Worst Performing Healthcare Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against the other healthcare stocks. The healthcare industry remains a vital and resilient sector which is driven by advancements in technology, increasing global demand, and an aging population. ReportLinker projects that the healthcare services industry will grow from $7.5 trillion in 2022 to $7.975 trillion in 2023. It is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3%, or $9.8 trillion, through 2027. The global healthcare market is divided into several segments, including hospitals, digital health, and healthcare services. The hospital market alone is predicted to grow by 4.18% a year between 2024 and 2029, reaching a market value of $5.19 trillion. In 2021, worldwide healthcare spending reached a record $9.8 trillion, or 10.3% of global GDP, according to a report released by the World Health Organization in December 2023. Spending was not uniformly dispersed, either, with low-income nations becoming more dependent on foreign help as government health spending declined. High-income nations spent about $4,000 per capita on health care, but 11% of the world's population resided in nations that spent less than $50 per person. Even while public health spending increased during COVID-19, this trend is unlikely to continue because nations are dealing with issues like high inflation, weak growth, and mounting debt. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), national healthcare spending is projected to reach an estimated $4.8 trillion in 2023 and grow at an annual rate of 5.6% between 2027 and 2032. A patient-centered, technology-driven revolution is taking place in the healthcare industry. Thanks to the epidemic, telehealth has become widely accepted; in 2023, the global market was estimated to be worth $60.15 billion and is predicted to continue growing. By 2028, the genomics-driven precision medicine market, which provides individualized therapies based on genetic composition, is expected to reach $50.2 billion. With $31.5 billion in equity funding from 2019 to 2022 and the potential for $360 billion in annual US savings over the next five years, AI is also revolutionizing healthcare. The global market for remote patient monitoring (RPM), which was valued at $71.9 billion in 2023, is expected to continue expanding thanks to wearable technology. Dr Bruce Aylward, WHO Assistant Director-General, Universal Health Coverage, Life Course, said: “Sustained public financing on health is urgently needed to progress towards universal health coverage. It is especially critical at this time when the world is confronted by the climate crisis, conflicts, and other complex emergencies. People’s health and well-being need to be protected by resilient health systems that can also withstand these shocks.” The most concerning aspect of the healthcare industry is the looming collapse of the U.S. healthcare system, particularly in terms of workforce shortages and financial instability. The healthcare industry is facing a severe staffing crisis. By 2030, it is projected that 124,000 more physicians will be needed, and 800,000 registered nurses (RNs) are anticipated to leave the profession by 2027. The current turnover rate for staff RNs is a staggering 24%. This shortage has led to the closure of vital patient services, including Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Obstetrics, and ICUs in some healthcare systems. Despite these challenges, the U.S. continues to spend nearly twice as much on healthcare as the OECD average, with worse outcomes on average. This disparity highlights the inefficiency and unsustainability of the current system. Additionally, 58% of hospital bad debt comes from insured patients, further straining the revenue cycle and limiting funds available for clinical services. The combination of these factors paints a grim picture of the U.S. healthcare system's future. Without significant intervention and reform, the industry risks a systemic collapse that could have far-reaching consequences for public health and the economy. In our methodology, we used a stock screener to pick stocks with a market capitalization above $10 billion and assessed their year-to-date (YTD) returns. We subsequently identified those with underwhelming YTD performance as of November 11 and ranked them accordingly. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A scientist surrounded by vials and beakers in a modern laboratory, proudly displaying a vaccine. Total YTD Return: -44.88% Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a biotechnology company specializing in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines. It develops synthetic mRNA that instructs cells to produce proteins to prevent or treat diseases. The company’s primary focus has been on vaccines, notably its COVID-19 vaccine, which is its first commercially approved product. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) has faced significant challenges recently, leading to a decline in its stock price, which makes Moderna, inc. stand among the worst performing healthcare stocks. The company announced plans to cut its Research and Development (R&D) budget by approximately 20% over the next three years due to low sales projections and disappointing vaccine sales. This includes discontinuing five R&D programs to save $1.1 billion annually by 2027. Additionally, Moderna provided cautious sales guidance for 2025 and aims to achieve break-even by 2028. Short-term headwinds include declining COVID-19 vaccination rates and a slow ramp-up for its RSV vaccine. Of the ten new products expected by 2027, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) plans to file for approval for three this year: a new COVID/flu vaccine, a next-gen COVID vaccine, and an RSV vaccine for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59. Despite these challenges, Wall Street remains optimistic about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s future, particularly regarding the rollout of its RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, in the US, and positive feedback from the European Medicines Agency. The company’s pipeline is also showing progress, with encouraging Phase III results for its flu and COVID-19 combo vaccine, supported by recent partnerships with BARDA and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) anticipates a 40%–50% sales increase in Q3 2024 and aims to end the year with approximately $9 billion in cash, expecting to return to growth in 2025. The company is optimistic about sales contributions from the EU market in 2025 and 2026. Moderna continues to adapt to the evolving vaccine market through new product rollouts and partnerships. Overall MRNA ranks 1st on our list of the worst performing healthcare stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Is Chevron Corporation (CVX) Among the Best Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Dividend Aristocrats: Top 7 Companies by Yield for November 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other dividend aristocrats. When it comes to investing in stocks, investors are always on the lookout for companies that can deliver steady income. That's why dividend stocks have always been a favorite. Among these, companies with the ability to grow their dividends consistently tend to be the ones that come out on top. Dividend aristocrats are companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years or more. Achieving this is no small accomplishment. Paying regular dividends can be challenging for many companies, let alone raising them for over two decades. Dividend aristocrats have delivered strong returns, outperforming other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, from the index’s launch in 2005 through September 2023, the dividend aristocrats index achieved a total return of 10.35%, surpassing the broader market's 9.54% return over the same period. These stocks are praised for not only their consistent dividend growth and steady equity gains but also their lower volatility. Over this time, dividend aristocrats experienced a volatility rate of 15.35%, compared to the market's slightly higher 16.31%. This suggests that dividend aristocrats generally exhibit more stable price movements. Their long history of increasing dividends for 25 years or more shows their ability to reward shareholders even during challenging times, such as the 2007 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. A report from Thornburg Investment Management compares the income generated from a hypothetical $1 million investment in the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index versus the Dividend Aristocrats Index from 1990 to 2023. The findings showed that the income from the $1 million investment in the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index decreased from around $90,000 annually in 1990 to just under $37,000 in 2023. In contrast, the income from the Dividend Aristocrats Index grew significantly, rising from about $30,000 in 1990 to more than $400,000 in 2023. The report also highlighted that dividend aristocrats outperformed the market in four of the six five-year periods between 1990 and 2023. This consistent outperformance, coupled with more stable returns, demonstrates the index's ability to deliver strong results over time. Also read: 10 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy Right Now The debate between high yields and dividend growth remains ongoing. Many investors believe that high yields are not necessarily risky. Achieving 25 consecutive years of dividend growth doesn't require sacrificing yield. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, Dividend Aristocrats have consistently provided higher yields than the broader market, typically ranging from 2.0% to 2.9% over the 26-year period from 1998 to 2022. Some studies have emphasized the long-term advantages of high-yield stocks, noting that as dividend yields rise, both returns tend to improve and risk decreases. Hartford Funds recently conducted an in-depth analysis of this, considering annualized standard deviation, which measures the volatility of a portfolio’s returns. A higher standard deviation indicates greater historical volatility. According to the findings, from December 1969 to March 2024, high-dividend portfolios produced an annualized return of 12.3%, mid-dividend portfolios returned 10.5%, and low-dividend portfolios earned 9.7%. The annualized standard deviations for these portfolios were 14.1%, 16%, and 20.8%, respectively. Our Methodology: For this list, we looked at a group of 67 dividend aristocrat companies, which are known for raising dividends for 25 years or more. From this list, we chose 7 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of November 26 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). An aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure. Dividend Yield as of November 26: 4.07% Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a California-based energy company that specializes in oil and gas. It is one of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with a 37-year streak of consistent dividend growth. Currently, the company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share and has a dividend yield of 4.07%, as of November 26. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has grown into one of the world's leading energy enterprises over time. It commits billions each year to expand its operations, leveraging both organic growth and acquisitions. These investments fuel business expansion while boosting profitability and cash flow. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated $9.7 billion in operating cash flow, which grew from $6.3 billion in the previous quarter. It returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) reported strong earnings in the third quarter of 2024, with revenues amounting to $50.67 billion. The revenue surpassed analysts' estimates by $1.63 billion. The company also achieved a 7% increase in global production from the previous year, bringing output to nearly 3.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). This growth was fueled by record production in the Permian Basin and the acquisition of PDC Energy. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was a part of 63 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 64 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes held by these hedge funds have a consolidated value of over $21 billion. With nearly 119 million shares, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company. Overall CVX ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Yuwen Yun (33), a Chinese national with an address at Fairy Hill, Blackrock, Co Dublin, appeared at Dún Laoghaire District Court on Wednesday morning after having been charged with three counts of money laundering contrary to section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering & Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. Solicitor Tracy Horan applied for bail for Ms Yun, a mother of two. Detective Garda Steven Dunican, attached to Blackrock Garda station, said Ms Yun had been arrested and charged with allegedly spending €750,000 on luxury handbags, having €350,000 worth of luxury handbags in her house and moving €250,000 through her bank account. He told Judge Anne Watkin the case arose from an investigation into a complex money laundering scheme and the charges are serious. He said gardaí are concerned that Ms Yun was a potential flight risk but, noting that one of her children is very young, he indicated gardaí would consent to bail on condition she surrender her Chinese passport.

Title: Alexis Ohanian and soccer star Midge Purce on docuseries The Offseason—and the venture case for women’s sports
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/27/alexis-ohanian-and-soccer-star-midge-purce-on-docuseries-the-offseason-and-the-venture-case-for-womens-sports/
Time Published: 2024-11-27T12:06:19Z
Full Content:
I frequently wonder about the lives of Olympians when they’re not being, well, Olympians. And there’s no group I find more mysterious than the American women’s soccer team—they’re some of the most celebrated athletes on the planet…once every four years. For me, women’s soccer has always presented a clear conundrum: What would it take to make us care all the time? It’s a problem that docuseries The Offseason is looking to solve. The docuseries—made by National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) forward Midge Purce and Alexis Ohanian’s VC firm Seven Seven Six—follows a Miami house full of NWSL players in (you guessed it) their offseason. The NWSL doesn’t have an official training camp for players preparing for a new season, so Purce created one—and filmed it, making a TV show. But almost no one believed in it at the start. “I remember coaches who I don’t even play for, they were trying to poke holes in the idea,” said Purce. “I’d have to break it down. ‘So, let me get this straight: Instead of having your player come to a training camp where they have access to all these things, you’d rather have them do it alone? With access to only whatever they have at home?’ They were so ready to undermine the concept.” Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six backed The Offseason, the final episode of which just dropped last week. (The NWSL final was also last week.) And the numbers are in: The show’s first season, which ran for six episodes and streamed on X, garnered more than 180 million views, Seven Seven Six and The Offseason team say. Some episodes fared better than others, but the overall reach is pretty staggering. It breaks down like this: Episode 6 drew 26.1 million views, Episode 5 attracted 7.5 million views, Episode 4 took in 66.1 million views, Episode 3 elicited 32.2 million views, Episode 2 got 6.6 million views, and Episode 1 saw 50.1 million views. (The team declined to disclose more granular details, but added that these are preliminary numbers, as they wait for X to offer up official totals.) “The world of sports media has been by and for men, for 100 years anyway,” said Ohanian. “This was a chance to put on display stars from this league, and tell a story that’s never been told before.” Ohanian, the founding principal owner of NWSL expansion team Angel City FC and still an investor in the club, believes women’s sports can kick back venture-scale returns, in part because of just how under-invested in the space is. There’s a chance to build new infrastructure, he says. “We’re building at first principles right now, from the start,” Ohanian told Fortune. “We’re able to build using technology in a way that makes this way more venture-viable than men’s sports.” In recent years, Ohanian has been one of the most visible investors in women’s sports, at a time when a number of female-fronted sports leagues are gaining traction. (He said his wife, tennis legend Serena Williams, even originally tried to talk him out of it, but she’s since come around.) “My argument is a simple one,” said Ohanian. “Look at the economic value of these teams that really only effectively tap into half the population at the end of the day. I don’t want to generalize, but most brands that are currently interested in aligning with sports are backing men’s teams. But we know who controls household spending. We know who drives culture…At a minimum, if you can reach an audience that’s as big as the current [audience for men’s sports], I think you clearly have a billion-dollar business.” The point that both Purce and Ohanian made to me is this: that what women’s sports is missing isn’t excellence; it’s missing the narrative that creates an audience. The goal of The Offseason was to build more narrative around the NWSL, and Purce deserves a lot of credit on this one: There’s nothing more interesting than watching someone tell the unvarnished truth. And The Offseason deals directly with the financial challenges of female athletes and the frankly twisted business of women’s soccer. One key athlete—in both the show and the NWSL—Lo’eau LaBonta openly talks about how distressingly little her athletic success has garnered her. “I got an engineering degree at Stanford,” LaBonta tells another athlete. “But for what? I’m playing soccer for four figures a year.” She says it with a sad laugh. María Sánchez, then a forward for the Houston Dash, had signed a record-setting deal shortly before The Offseason was filmed. That record? A three-year $1.5 million deal. That’s far short of the NBA veterans’ minimum this season. Money is part of The Offseason, and that’s by design, said Purce. “This is pretty personal to me,” she told Fortune. “For a long time, I’ve been taught to regurgitate that the reason I play is because I just love it so much, that it’s not about money at all. It’s become such a learned talking point for women in sports. ‘You’re here to inspire the next generation. You’re here to be a model for other little girls.’ It’s frowned upon to say: ‘No, I’m here to make money and I’m here because I want to be the best in the world at something.’” For Ohanian and Purce to be right, women’s sports doesn’t just need heroes. We need to know who they are. And The Offseason may turn out to be a valuable bridge for new NWSL fans. Just look at me, a longtime sports fan who’s spent precious little time watching the NWSL. But now I’m ready to watch the games. A quick programming note…Happy Thanksgiving! We’re off tomorrow for the holiday, but we’ll be back on Black Friday.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) stands against other AI news updates that Wall Street is monitoring. AI companies in the United States, many of whom have extensive business relations in China, are waiting anxiously for President-elect Donald Trump to assume office and announce possible changes to American policies towards China that will provide greater clarity on future US trade with the Asian country. Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing. Latest reports from news platform Axios contend that Donald Trump is considering the appointment of an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Per the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.

Close up image of an engineer inspecting the control panel of a modern power plant. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) operates as an energy and home services company in the United States and Canada. The firm is emerging as an important AI firm because it produces and sells electricity, vital for powering the AI needs of companies and consumers alike. On November 26, Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $113, up from $93, citing more confidence in the cross-selling thesis with upside to both estimates and valuation. The advisory is increasing its 2029 EBITDA estimate to $4.5 billion, up about $230 million from its prior estimate and almost $1 billion higher than the sleepy consensus, to more fully reflect the company’s $750 million growth plan. Overall, NRG ranks 11th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of NRG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NRG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks That are Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC) stands against the other AI stocks. Perplexity, the California-based AI startup that is challenging the dominance of Google in the Internet Search market, is considering the development of a $50 device that brings the conversational search abilities of the platforms it offers on the consumer market. Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of the firm, recently posted on social networking platform X and said the company would definitely sell such a device if the post got more than 5,000 likes. Other AI startups have also tried making AI-only devices, the latest example being Humane and their AI Pin, but these devices have not caught mass attention because of buggy performance. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Perplexity could succeed where others have failed as the firm has much more cash in the bank to hire the right teams for the purpose. News publication The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the startup is planning to raise more than $500 million at an upcoming funding round that would value the firm at more than $8 billion. The report claims that the platform the startup markets currently receives about 15 million queries a day and brings in around $50 million in annualized revenue. Perplexity uses AI to help people search the web in a chatbot-style interface.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Semtech Corporation (NASDAQ:SMTC) develops, manufactures, and markets analog and mixed-signal semiconductor and advanced algorithms. On November 26, Craig-Hallum raised the price target on the stock to $70 from $48 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The advisory notes the company reported a beat and strong guide on data center strength, which was primarily driven by Fiber products. The advisory continues to think Semtech's LPO TIA driver product could show strong interest from data centers with expected sales in late calendar 2025. Overall SMTC ranks 14th on our list of the AI stocks that are making headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of SMTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: While private equity firms own 40% of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 49% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significant control over SATS by individual investors implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions 50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders 11% of SATS is held by Institutions A look at the shareholders of SATS Ltd. (SGX:S58) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Meanwhile, private equity firms make up 40% of the company’s shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of SATS, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for SATS Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that SATS does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of SATS, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in SATS. Our data shows that Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited is the largest shareholder with 40% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 2.2%. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that SATS Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around S$19m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private equity firms hold a 40% stake in SATS. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand SATS better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for SATS that you should be aware of. Ultimately the future is most important.

Title: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she doesn’t take lobbyist cash. Records tell a different story

Mountain View By Robert Schmad, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has repeatedly claimed that she won’t accept funds from lobbyists. Campaign finance records, however, show she has received nearly 100 separate donations from registered lobbyists since taking office. Ocasio-Cortez’s account description on X states that the congresswoman is “people-funded” and “takes no lobbyist [cash],” using a money bag emoji in place of the word “cash.” Despite her claim to the contrary, the representative has taken thousands of dollars in contributions from lobbyists since assuming office, according to federal records. The congresswoman has an extensive record decrying the influence of money on politics. In 2018, shortly after winning office for the first time, Ocasio-Cortez criticized her party’s “refusal to reject [corporate] lobbyist money.” Since then, she has called to ban members of Congress from working as lobbyists after leaving office, rebuked fellow Democrats for their close ties to lobbyists, and accused lobbyists of working to kill legislation that would benefit the public. While Ocasio-Cortez has harsh words for lobbyists, she has accepted donations from them every year since she first took office in 2018. Dave Koshgarian, a lobbyist with Ernst & Young, has been Ocasio-Cortez’s most consistent donor, sending her thousands of dollars beginning in 2020. Koshgarian has represented a number of corporate clients, including Duke Energy, MetLife, General Electric, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock, according to lobbying disclosures. Other clients represented by Ocasio-Cortez’s lobbyist donors include , among others, Nike, Delta Air Lines, healthcare trade associations, and the New Venture Fund , one arm of a massive Democratic-aligned dark money network managed by the Arabella Advisors consulting firm. Ocasio-Cortez has also been critical of the presence of dark money, funds that filter into the ideological causes without a clear original donor, in politics. She has argued that dark money groups sway the Supreme Court and unethically influence policy development. Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that she doesn’t take donations from lobbyists isn’t new, as the representative insists on social media that she swore off lobbyist cash from the very beginning. Cortez has, however, dialed down her public criticism of the lobbying industry in recent years, not making a single post on X with the words “lobby,” “lobbyist,” or “lobbying” since September 2022. The Washington Examiner reported in April 2023 that one of TikTok’s top lobbyists sat on the board of directors of a nonprofit group advised by Ocasio-Cortez. The congresswoman vigorously fought against proposed bans on the Chinese social media platform at the time, arguing that the United States shouldn’t ban TikTok but should instead impose blanket protections against data harvesting. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “This is how corporate lobbying works,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote in May 2019. “Lobbyists ID bills they need to kill to keep profits high (no matter the human cost), come up w/ ‘sensible’ talking points to mask intent + say policy is ‘misguided,’ then schmooze policymakers in secret into accepting said talking points.” Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment. Mike Davis, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, warned New York Attorney General Letitia James to not pursue any legal action against Trump during his second term, threatening to send her to prison if she does so. “I dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term,” Davis said […] President-elect Donald Trump reportedly wants to fire thousands of federal workers. He has also suggested a cost-cutting commission led by Tesla founder Elon Musk, which presumably would include firing government employees. There are a few they should start with to combat the weaponization of the federal government, most prominently by the Department of Justice.

Title: NYSE files to list Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum mixed ETP

The ETP uses market cap weighting to give balanced and simplified exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum to investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 Form to list a Bitwise exchange-traded product (ETP) offering direct spot exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), weighted by their market capitalization. According to a Bitwise statement, the proposed Bitcoin-Ether ETP aims at simplifying portfolio allocation for investors seeking exposure to the crypto market’s most established assets. Its market-cap weighting ensures that the fund dynamically adjusts to reflect these assets’ evolving dominance. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated: “Bitcoin and ether aren’t competitors any more than gold and tech stocks are competitors. So when investors ask us which is better to add to their portfolio, often our answer is ‘both.’ This fund aims to make that recommendation easy and actionable, providing balanced exposure to the world’s two largest crypto assets. I think it’s going to be a huge hit with investors.” Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs have collectively amassed $4.2 billion in assets under management. If approved, this dual-asset ETP would be a first-of-its-kind product in the US market, allowing investors simultaneous exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies. However, other similar products are also waiting for approval. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently delayed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s Crypto Index ETF, which tracks BTC and ETH, although it is not market cap-weighted. Furthermore, Brazilian asset manager Hashdex filed to launch a similar product in June, as the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF would track BTC and ETH. According to CryptoSlate data, as of Nov. 26, BTC and ETH collectively had a market cap of over $2.1 trillion. Despite their dominance, investors usually perceive the two crypto use cases differently. Investors primarily regard Bitcoin as a digital store of value optimized for security and monetary use cases. Meanwhile, ETH powers the Ethereum blockchain, the largest decentralized ecosystem for applications, boasting nearly $110 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per DefiLlama data. Additionally, traditional finance giants like BlackRock, Visa, and Franklin Templeton chose the infrastructure to launch their products.

Title: Teach:able’s Founder Tackles A New Challenge: Democratizing Access To Tax-Efficient Retirement Accounts For The Self-Employed

Time Published: 2024-11-26T22:41:26Z
Full Content:
Ankur Nagpal, founder of the edu-tech startup Teach:able, has entered the wealth-tech world with ... [+] Carry. Ankur Nagpal started Teach:able, a platform for independent course creators, in 2013, with the dream of democratizing access to education. The first-generation immigrant from Oman, a 2010 graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, scaled that startup to $60 million in annual recurring revenue. He sold it to Hotmart, a platform that allows users to sell digital products around the world, in what he describes as a nine-figure exit in 2020. Now Nagpal aims to provide widespread access to something new: easy-to-use, tax-efficient retirement savings plans for the self-employed. In September 2022, he started Carry, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based startup that offers accounts such as a solo 401(k), a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, brokerage accounts, and a no-fee robo advisor. Small businesses can currently use the accounts in conjunction with the payroll software Gusto or on their own. Carry raised $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Accomplice VC, based in Boston, in July 2024. Accomplice VC has backed startups such as AngelList, FreshBooks and Patreon. The company is picking up traction. Nagpal says it has about 2,000 paying customers and $60 million in assets under management and is generating over $1 million in annualized revenue. It has attracted most users through online courses, webinars and workshops, with no paid advertising yet. Nagpal projects that Carry will have 3,000 paying customers and approximately $100 million in assets under management by year-end. Carry is among a growing field of fin-tech and wealth-tech companies that promise to simplify investing through a better user experience. The wealth tech space is expected to grow to $18.6 billion by 2031, according to Allied Market Research. Some startups in the space have powerful partners. For instance, Douugh, a “smart banking” account provider based in Sydney Australia,offers investors access to a Bitcoin fund managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. As many entrepreneurs discover when their businesses start generating revenue, their taxes rise as their profits do. That can leave them with little left over to reinvest or save for retirement unless they find good advisors. Nagpal spotted a gap in the marketplace when the accountants and attorneys he hired for Teach:able saved him a significant amount on taxes. For every individual who had the means to invest in this expertise, he concluded, thousands of self-employed business owners did not—and were missing out. “Saving on taxes is important for everyone, but for a lot of people it's just too hard or too intimidating and they don't know where to start," Nagpal said. “I wanted to help business owners unlock tax savings.” One barrier many owners discover is the complexity of setting up their accounts in an industry where legal compliance is paramount. At Carry, he hopes to simplify that process. “A lot of people choose us for the user experience,” he says. “There’s better UI/UX.” Some owners find it too expensive to set their accounts up with traditional 401(k) providers. Setup costs may be as high as $2,000, often with annual administrative fees of $750 to $3,000. There may also be a fee for each participant. Carry, aiming to offer more attractive pricing, charges $299 a year for a basic plan and $499 a year for a plan that lets account holders invest in options including a custom plan, alternative assets like Bitcoin, a self-directed Roth IRA or self-directed Traditional IRA. Carry sets up the accounts but never has access to the funds in them. The entrepreneurs who set up the accounts are appointed the sole trustee and plan administrator. The firm works with Ocho Investment Advisors, an SEC-registered firm, and Drive Wealth LLC, an SEC-registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC, via which securities and cash in the account are protected up to $500,000, of which $250,000 may be in cash. According to Carry, if the startup were to close, users’ 401(k)s would remain in existence, and all funds would remain under the control of the account holder. Account holders could keep their funds with Drive Wealth or transfer the assets to their bank account. Nagpal also runs Vibe Capital, a fund with nearly $100 million in assets under management, which has invested in more than 80 startups globally. Among them are Beacons, a platform for creators to sell their work; Vimcal, a calendar-scheduling app; and Writer, a secure enterprise platform that lets users create AI-first workflows. Accomplice VC, the lead investor in Carry, is an “anchor” limited partner behind Vibe. Matt Brezina, an early-stage technology investor and advisor at Ford Street Ventures in San Francisco, was one of the first investors in Teachable and is now an early investor in Carry. One reason is his belief in Nagpal’s entrepreneurial ability and growth-focused approach. "He's one of the greats, honestly. If I could find eight founders like him per year, my job would be really easy," says Brezina. In Brezina’s view, Carry solves a pressing need in the marketplace in addressing some of the pain of tax planning as a self-employed entrepreneur. “Charlie Munger said whoever you work with, you have one partner in every business deal with you, and that’s the IRS,” says Brezina. “Just thinking about your taxes and tax planning is an intelligent thing to do as a business owner.” Brezina set up his own solo 401(k) on the platform two years ago. He likes that it offers the ability to access asset classes not always available for 401(k)s with larger providers, such as Bitcoin. “Carry has been solving a lot of core problems for me,” he says. “They’ve made it really easy to know how much I can contribute to my Roth and regular 401(k) accounts for solo entrepreneurs. I’m now putting more money toward retirement than ever before because of their platform.” Whether other players start crowding into this specific niche remains to be seen. One barrier to entry is the heavy weight of compliance. As he grows the business, Nagpal is studying for his broker-dealer license. With fin-tech and wealth-tech platforms proliferating, Attorney Andrew Sherman, a partner in Brown Rudnick in Washington, D.C. who advises business owners, says it’s important for entrepreneurs to do their due diligence on any platforms they are considering, especially for a 401(k). "There are so many interesting solutions right now in wealth management and advice," he says. "If you're looking at it to manage your company's 401(k), I would add two or three layers of additional due diligence. You’re now acting as a fiduciary of your employees’ 401(k)s.” While many of the incumbents have the advantage of wide name recognition and decades of experience, Nagpal—tapping his experience as an early player in the online learning platform industry—hopes to offer something many bigger competitors can't: speed. When the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022 passed, Carry helped users get a $500 tax credit for each of three tax years by helping them to set up their accounts according to the law's requirements, he points out—while many competitors moved too slowly, he says. “Tax law is always changing and evolving,” he says. “We’ll be the first to react to it so we can pass on as many benefits as possible.” One Community.

A 46-year-old former model who pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of a mother of two had consumed 12 alcoholic drinks, which included cocktails, prosecco, wine and gin, in the hours before the crash. Ms Sheila Dunne (50), who was described by her daughter as a “an amazing woman – worth her weight in gold”, died following a single-vehicle crash in Sarsfield Court in Glanmire, Cork, last February. Poignantly, her husband Ted had died of Covid in February 2021. The death of Ms Dunne left their two children without any living parent. The special needs assistant was just 1.5km from her home in Glanmire when the crash occurred. Jennifer Thomas of Oakfield View, Glanmire, Co Cork, appeared before Cork Circuit Criminal Court on Tuesday having pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the death of Ms Dunne on February 11th last. Defence counsel Tom Creed, SC, told Judge Helen Boyle that “unfounded social media rumours” and inaccurate newspaper reports had circulated in the wake of the crash. He said that “malicious rumours” had spread in Cork that the body of Ms Dunne had been moved in the vehicle. Investigating garda Det Gda Mark Durcan confirmed there was no truth to any suggestions that Ms Thomas or any other person had moved the body of Ms Dunne following the crash. Det Gda Durcan said that the crash occurred at 7.30pm on February 11th last at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire in Cork. Ms Thomas had been socialising with Ms Dunne, her friend of more than 20 years, from lunchtime that day when they went for a meal at a restaurant in Douglas in the city. They went to a bar in Blackrock in Cork and then on to a bar in Glanmire before getting into Ms Thomas’s jeep. Det Gda Durcan said that in the minutes before the crash occurred Ms Thomas fell asleep behind the wheel twice while stopped at traffic lights. She did two U-turns in a matter of minutes and drove on the wrong side of the road at Hazelwood Road in Glanmire. She knocked down traffic cones as she drove towards Sallybrook and narrowly missed two pedestrians on the footpath. Det Gda Durcan said Ms Thomas took a left-hand bend at Sarsfield Court in Glanmire and failed to straighten up entering a grass verge. The Bluetooth system in the car automatically called the emergency services. Speed was not a factor in the case. Det Gda Durcan said Ms Thomas was wearing her seat belt when the crash occurred. However, Ms Dunne was not. He indicated that the impact of the crash led Ms Dunne, who was in the front-passenger seat, to fall on top of Ms Thomas. Det Gda Durcan said that roof had to be cut off the vehicle in order to extricate the women. He said when gardaí arrived at the scene Ms Thomas was asked who was driving. She said she was and then she “got erratic” and was unable to give a definitive answer. She then said that Ms Dunne was driving as she had “more control”. When she was shown CCTV at a later date by gardaí, Ms Thomas accepted that she was driving. She also said she had no recollection of the crash due to concussion. However, there was no medical evidence of concussion. Ms Dunne died in hospital two days after the crash. Lilley Dunne, a 23-year-old daughter of Sheila Dunne, said in her victim impact statement that she came to court with a “shattered heart” weighed down heavily by the loss of her “rock of a mother”. She said that she was speaking on behalf of herself and her younger brother. Lilley Dunne said that she and her brother head already suffered the “unbearable” loss of their father, Ted, from Covid. “Now to experience the agonising loss of Mom, feels like a cruel twist of fate that I cannot comprehend,” she said. “This experience is what I can only describe as hell. My beautiful mom was taken from us far too soon at the young age of 50. In a car crash caused by a reckless decision made by a selfish individual. This choice has altered our lives forever. “We spent two days at my mom’s bedside hoping for a miracle. Out of respect, I made the decision to allow Jennifer to come in to say goodbye to my mom. Knowing what I know now, my decision would have been different.” Ms Dunne said Ms Thomas’s “malicious lies” had trickled out to “vultures” in the media. “Compounding our grief, newspapers and social media outlets covered the story and reported that my mom was the driver of the car. Jennifer’s complete fabrication painted a picture of my mom, Sheila, that was far from the truth, sensationalising the tragedy and worsening our family suffering.” Sheila’s mother, Esther O’Brien, said she was “heartbroken” to have lost her daughter to a drunk driver. “This loss has not only shattered my life but has also left two precious grandchildren without their mother,” she said. The court heard that Ms Thomas had 10 previous convictions for road-traffic offences, larceny and misuse of drugs. Defence barrister Tom Creed, SC said witnesses who arrived at the scene of the crash described his client as being distraught at the possibility that Ms Dunne could have died. Mr Creed said that his client has suffered from long-term mental health difficulties and often wishes that she died during the crash. He added that Ms Thomas was hugely remorseful for her actions. Mr Creed said that his client accepted that getting behind the wheel drunk was an “outrageous” thing to do. Judge Boyle reserved her decision in the case. Ms Thomas was remanded in custody pending her sentencing on Thursday. She was warned that she was facing a custodial sentence. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
