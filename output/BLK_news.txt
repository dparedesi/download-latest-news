Title: Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings

This week, America’s biggest banks are set to report their quarterly earnings. But as Reuters reported Tuesday (April 8), investors are less likely to be focused on profits than on the banks’ view of the economy amid steep U.S. tariffs. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said the biggest impact of the tariffs in the quarters to come “will be higher reserves for loan losses as the odds of recession rise.” As Reuters notes, banks are likely to reserve billions for potential loan defaults in the quarters ahead. Loan losses will probably increase this year due to newly revised accounting rules that require banks to account for losses over the full terms of the loans. “Banks are a reflection of the economy — if the economy worsens, their results will follow,” said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions at Argus Research. In addition to more reserves to cover losses on existing loans, Biggar expects banks to scale back lending as they see higher risks. The report argues that banks are likely to face questions during earnings calls about the market selloff that has erased trillions of dollars from global stock indexes. Bank stocks were some of the hardest hit, after surging earlier in the year on optimism about a jump in dealmaking. This week will see Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase report their earnings, all happening on Friday (April 11). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that the tariffs could have lasting negative consequences, such as inflation and recession. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote in his annual shareholder letter. “In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” As PYMNTS noted in a report Tuesday on the impact of the tariffs on the FinTech sector, some observers have an even more pessimistic view. For example, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink notes that many U.S. business leaders believe the country is already in a recession. “Where do FinTechs fit in the larger picture? Analysts remain cautious about FinTech growth prospects, citing economic uncertainty and regulatory pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. “Despite this, there is optimism about the sector’s long-term potential, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as a robust employment market and receding inflation. However, that outlook is clouded by the current economic turmoil.” Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings Report: Justice Department to End ‘Regulation by Prosecution’ of Crypto-Related Activities Best Buy Launches Creator Program With Influencer Storefronts i2c Teams With Access Finance to Expand Credit Card in US We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Wall Street Leaders Finally Turn on Trump’s Tariffs

Wall Street titans had been oddly silent about Trump tariffs—until they became real. Amid market turmoil brought on by the President’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, a growing trickle of prominent bank CEOs and investors are raising the alarm on how these levies could cause irreparable harm to the global economy. Even established Trump supporters, such as Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman, are vocalizing concerns about the potential fallout. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Here’s a look at what Wall Street’s most prominent leaders are saying: Ken Griffin, a major Republican donor, called Trump’s tariffs a “huge policy mistake” while speaking at the University of Miami event yesterday (April 7). Griffin estimated that it could take 20 years for the tariffs to actually bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. “It’s not 20 weeks. It’s not two years. It’s decades,” he stressed. But before then, the levies will raise the cost of groceries, appliances and vehicles for middle- and lower-class families. The speech mark a departure from Griffin’s previous comments on Trump’s tariff policy, which he claimed wasn’t a particularly important business issue. “I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world,” said Griffin yesterday. “That’s the path we’re on.” Economic fragmentation caused by the tariffs could be “disastrous in the long run,” said JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon in his latest annual letter to shareholders. He warned that the levies will increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession, and he urged for negotiations to take place sooner rather than later. “America First is fine, as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone,” Dimon wrote. Dimon reportedly supported Kamala Harris during the 2024 Presidential election, the banking CEO has previously defended Trump’s tariff policy. In January, he called tariffs as an effective negotiation tactic and advised people to “get over it.” Bill Ackman, head of the hedge fund Pershing Square and one of Wall Street’s loudest supporters of Trump, has changed his tune. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” said Ackman in a series of X posts over the weekend. He described the levies as akin to “launching a global economic war against the whole world at once.” The hedge fund manager today (April 8) said that some of his comments on tariffs have been “misinterpreted” and noted that he still supports tariffs as a tool for negotiation. But he reiterated his call for a pause of up to 90 days before the tariffs come into effect to allow for negotiation. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), an economic downturn in the U.S. is already taking place and will only continue to escalate. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” said Fink yesterday while speaking at the Economic Club of New York. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” he added. Fink alluded to America’s economic uncertainty in his annual shareholder letter last week. “I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They’re more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,” he wrote. Much of the economic benefits reaped over the past eight decades can be attributed to the growth of global trade, said Howard Marks during a Bloomberg TV interview on April 4. Now, the state of the world “is completely in flux,” he said. “We’ve gone from free trade and world trade and globalization to this system, which implies significant restrictions on trade in every direction and a step toward isolation for the United States,” he added. Last October, Daniel Loeb praised Trump’s economic policy and said his tariffs would have a positive impact on the market. He isn’t so sure now. On April 5, he reposted an article on X from the conservative think-tank American Enterprise Institute that criticizes the formula the administration used to calculate the tariffs. “Thoughtful piece on potential conceptual as well as practical errors that went into the announced tariff policy,” said Loeb of the report. “It will be a test of the administration’s judgement versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days.” While hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio agrees that the U.S. has a problem to fix when it comes to domestic manufacturing, he doesn’t believe tariffs are the answer. “I agree with the problem. I am very concerned about the solution, the practicality of the solution,” he told CNBC in an interview published today. The levies will see company costs rise and their revenue plunge, said the Bridgewater Associates founder. “This is going to create great sand in the gears of production worldwide,” he added. Stanley Druckenmiller, a longtime Republican, is turning against the levies. “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10 percent,” said the billionaire investor in an X post on April 6. Druckenmiller has close ties to the Trump administration, having acted as the boss of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent when the two worked at George Soros’ hedge fund.

Title: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Predicts Mag 7 Corporate Treasuries Begin Rapid Accumulation of Bitcoin – Here’s Why

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that corporate buying of Bitcoin (BTC) is most likely about to explode. In a new interview with Kyle Chasse on his YouTube channel, Hougan notes that while holding BTC in corporate treasuries is still relatively unorthodox, the same could be said about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their early days. Hougan says he sees a theme developing in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset that parallels the embrace of BTC ETFs. “Let me make an analogy to the ETF space… If you look at institutional asset managers in the crypto space, in the early days, it was only crypto native people. It was Grayscale, it was Bitwise, and there were a few others. And then you had financial institutions run not as public companies but as family-run businesses. Fidelity is run by a family, one person can make a decision – ‘I’m going into Bitcoin’ – and they did. VanEck is run by Jan Van Eck. He loved Bitcoin and they went into the space. But fast forward to today and its BlackRock and it’s Invesco, and it’s the largest institutions in the world coming into the space. You’re seeing the same thing in companies. It was Michael Saylor alone. Then it’s Michael Saylor and Metaplanet and a few others. Oh, well, Block has some Bitcoin, and Tesla may be reconsidering it, and PayPal is probably going to look at it and it’s expanding out. Why do we not think that BlackRock – the BlackRock equivalent – will come in and own Bitcoin, which is a Mag 7 company putting it on its balance sheet at five or ten percent of their massive cash pile? To me, it pattern matches exactly. People were skeptical then, and look at us today. People are skeptical now, and I think we’ll be in the same place in a few years.” At time of writing, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has the largest corporate treasury of BTC, followed by mining firms Marathon and Riot Platforms. Tesla holds the fifth-largest corporate stack of Bitcoin.

Title: Panama Files Criminal Charges Against Chinese-Linked Canal Port Owner for Breach of Contract
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2025/04/08/panama-files-criminal-charges-against-chinese-linked-canal-port-owner-for-breach-of-contract/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T17:29:54Z

Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores on Monday announced that he would file a criminal complaint against Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, on accusations of breach of contract over the two ports it manages at the Panama Canal. Flores, during a press conference, stated that an audit of PPC launched by his office this year found that the company, which operates two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, found evidence of breaches of contract that amount to more than $300 million losses to the Panamanian state. Flores further accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of “misrepresenting” financial figures and will therefore file criminal lawsuits against the company’s board and the authorities responsible for the 25-year renewal of PPC’s concession. “There are important findings that show amounts of more than 300 million dollars owed to us due to noncompliance with the contract. We see a renewal that also did not comply with all the procedures of law, nor does it have the endorsement of the Comptroller’s Office,” Flores said. “I want to announce that in the next few days we will go to the Public Prosecutor’s Office to file the corresponding complaints so that the directors who handled this renewal, the board of directors and the officers of Panama Ports, who will obviously have to explain to the Panamanian people before the Public Prosecutor’s Office why so much magnanimity, why so much benevolence in a contract that has been unfair,” he continued. Panama Ports Company signed a contract with Panama in 1997 that granted PPC a 25-year concession to develop and administer two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal located in the provinces of Balboa and Cristóbal. Local authorities renewed the contract for an additional 25-year period in 2021 as per the terms of the original 1997 deal, which reportedly contained automatic-renewal provisions so long as PPC complied with the agreed terms. In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez requested that the nation’s Supreme Court rule to declare the 1997 concession contract “unconstitutional” because it allegedly violated 15 articles of the Panamanian constitution. Gómez presented the request a month after the Comptroller General’s office began an audit of PPC. In March, Comptroller General Flores stated that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described them as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” PCC’s two Panama ports have been at the center of a debate initiated by President Donald Trump in December after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal and denounced China’s alleged growing influence and control of the interoceanic trade route. The two ports are among the list of facilities included in a $22.8 billion deal between Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong-Kong conglomerate that owns PPC, and asset manager BlackRock. The deal was blocked by the Chinese communist regime last week. Flores clarified at the start of his press conference that the PPC audit proceedings were signed off on January 15 but that the auditing staff physically began its labor on January 20 — the same day as the United States’ Inauguration day — stressing that the date “has nothing to do” with what international media “may possibly say” about the proceedings being a response to the U.S. statements and that the audit is an autonomous action of Panama and his office. Flores said the financial damages to the Panamanian state can be estimated from “different angles” and explained that under the original terms of the 1997 contract, Panama was receiving a percentage of the company’s profits that increased every year, reaching $27 million in 2002. In that same year, Flores further detailed, the administration of former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso modified the contract so that Panama would receive ten percent of net profits instead of ten percent of gross profits — which made the Central American nation go from receiving $27 million in 2002 to only $1.3 million in 2003. “If we had complied with the first contract in full, Panama should have received $1.337 billion during the concession period. And we only received $483 million, with a loss to the Republic of Panama of $853 million in the same period,” Flores said. “Now, that is not the company’s fault. It is the fault of many people, bad Panamanians, I tell you, who delivered what they did not have to deliver, they negotiated very badly.” “If we add this to the economic damage caused by the fact that we gave them so many tax exemptions, they did not pay the rent, this results in another $350 million more,” he continued. “In other words, the real damage for the Republic is in the order of 1.2 billion dollars at a rate of 55 approximately per year that we as a country stopped receiving.” Flores also explained that PPC used “concessionaires” to perform container transportation services, and detailed that the Panamanian State does not receive a percentage of the profits of these companies. Additionally, the Comptroller pointed out that even though the volume of containers increased, the reported profit of the company, “at least on paper,” remains practically the same. “The company where Panama has a 10 percent stake, which is Panama Ports, earns less every day with more TEUs [Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit]. I can assume that this is happening there, and so can everyone who is watching me,” Flores said. The Comptroller, who described the contract as “leonine,” stressed that PPC received $3.78 billion between 1997 and 2003 but only paid a total of $236 million to the Panamanian state, and said, “In other words, they gave us a tip.” Christian K.

WoW Classic Version 1.15.7 Patch Notes April 8, 2025 New Quest Content in Eastern Plaguelands Players who have completed the Phase 7 Eastern Plaguelands quest “Scarlet Activities” may speak with Leonid Bartholomew the Revered at Light’s Hope Chapel to accept the quest “Unrest at Tyr’s Hand”. This quest splits off into a few different questlines related to Scarlet Enclave content. New Area - New Avalon Go behind enemy lines in disguise as you infiltrate the town of New Avalon within the Scarlet Enclave, prior to the events that transpire within the raid. This is a small crafting-focused town with access to a few common city services, such as a bank, a neutral auction house, and an alchemy lab. New Raid Dungeon – The Scarlet Enclave Starting at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, April 10, the Scarlet Enclave raid will be available for players to enter. New Legendary Weapon Questline Raid groups progressing through The Scarlet Enclave may encounter a “Ruined Lightforge Blade” legendary quest item as a drop from a certain boss encounter. This item is the quest starter for the legendary weapon questline. Changes Classes Going into Phase 8, we want to make some changes to damage numbers coming out of Naxxramas, refine and align the durability profile of tanks, and create more room for healers to coexist. You’ll notice a lot of changes are to previous tier’s set bonuses. We wouldn’t normally touch these bonuses, but with access to these via shoulder enchants, and some Tier 3 bonuses doing a lot of the heavy lifting for some classes inside of Naxxramas,we felt these were the correct adjustments to make to ensure that gear upgrades going forward remain meaningful. Druid Hunter Mage Paladin Priest Rogue Shaman Warlock Developers’ notes: In the opposite vein as Shaman Tanks, Warlock tanks have had too high avoidance, too low durability, and this was felt by most guilds who used a Warlock main tank for something like Maexxna during Naxxramas progression. We shifted Tank Rogues away from avoidance cap in exchange for allowing them to actually take hits, and for Warlocks we plan to do the same thing by increasing their health pool in Metamorphosis, which was starting to look like it wouldn’t be able to keep up with the health pools of other tanks. DPS Tier 3 4piece damage changed to 33% of the DoT’s damage (was 75%). Pets now benefit from your Spell Haste and convert it into both Spell and Melee Haste. New effect: Metamorphosis grants 15% increased health. Dance of the Wicked now converts 70% of your critical strike chance into Dodge (was 100%). Damage dealt reduction in Metamorphosis changed to 10% reduction (was 15%). Threat increase in Metamorphosis changed to 50% (was 77%). Shadow Cleave now grants 4 spell power per defense (up from 2). Chaos Bolt changed to deal Chaos damage, which is Fire, Frost, Arcane, Shadow, and Nature damage (was just Fire) . Demonic Pact now only counts half of the spell power from Defender’s Resolve (so it is unchanged and does not benefit from the above buff). Warrior Developers’ notes: Warriors have been relying on using the active on the Tempered Interference-Negating Helmet from Gnomeregan to compete. We feel that is clunky and unintuitive to the average player, so we have removed the ability to use the gnomeregan helmets past level 59 and offset that change for Warriors with 10% attack speed for 2handed weapons, and 5% attack speed for 1handed weapons. Soul of the Titan damage increase to Heroic Strike, Slam, and Overpower changed to 10% (Was 25%). Soul of the Battle Forecaster changed to 5% crit, damage, and damage reduction when changing stances (was 10%). Soul of the Sanguinist damage changed to 15% (was 20%). Frenzied Assault changed to 40% attack speed (was 30%). Single-Minded Fury changed to 4% attack speed per stack (was 3%). Soul of the Aftershock reduces the cooldown of Shockwave by 25% (was 50%).

Title: Pentagon’s Hegseth to Visit Panama Canal After Trump Threats

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Panama Canal Authority By Phil Stewart PANAMA CITY, April 8 (Reuters) – The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama’s government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama’s forces and said China would not be allowed to “weaponize” the canal by using Chinese firms’ commercial relationships for espionage. “Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence,” Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. “China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.” More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world’s second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth is expected to get a close-up look at the Panama Canal later on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump’s threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump’s tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth’s visit. “On the whole, this hasn’t been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama’s formal move to exit China’s Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump’s crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country’s dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal’s security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump’s southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was “reclaiming” the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration’s assertion that China’s presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. “What’s not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he’s used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn’t been,” Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama’s administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it “is, and will continue to be, Panamanian.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart; additional reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Rod Nickel and Alistair Bell) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect Wednesday over the concerns of many of the nation’s billionaires, as even some longtime supporters of the president—including Elon Musk—have expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact on the economy. Elon Musk arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol ... More Rotunda on January 20 in Washington, DC. Jamie Dimon: The JPMorganChase CEO told Fox Business on Wednesday he thinks a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s tariffs—though he said he’s right now taking a “calm view” of the financial situation, “But I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here”—after Dimon expressed concerns in his annual letter to shareholders Monday morning, saying they “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.” Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO shared a video early Monday of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade and the benefits of importing goods and reportedly lobbied Trump personally not to impose the tariffs, The Washington Post reported Monday. He’s also been sparring with Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro for praising tariffs—most recently saying Tuesday Navarro is a “moron” who’s “dumber than a sack of bricks”—and Musk’s brother (and Tesla board member) Kimbal Musk has criticized the tariffs as a “permanent tax” on Americans. Bill Ackman: The hedge fund manager is a longtime Trump supporter but has repeatedly spoken out against the president’s tariffs, calling Tuesday for the White House to issue a 30, 60 or 90-day pause on the tariffs “to enable negotiations to be completed without a major global economic disruption” and saying Wednesday morning the financial chaos Trump’s tariffs have sparked are “not the markers of successful policy” and “many small businesses will go bankrupt” if they’re not paused soon. Ken Griffin: The Citadel founder—and major Republican donor—said at an event Monday that Trump’s tariffs are a “huge policy mistake,” with Bloomberg reporting he urged audience members to lobby Trump to step back on the tariffs and said he’s “really afraid of [the U.S.] abdicating our role of leadership for the free world.” Daniel Loeb: While Loeb said in February he thought Trump’s initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn’t harm the stock market, the hedge fund manager has spoken out against Trump’s more sweeping policy, sharing a post Monday that noted the stock market chaos is “all in the head of 1 person. Who can change his mind at any time”—writing, “Exactly”—and sharing criticism of the tariffs by billionaire Ken Griffin and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Larry Fink: The BlackRock CEO suggested at the Economic Club of New York Monday that “the economy is weakening as we speak” and the market could fall another 20% from where it is now as a result of Trump’s tariffs, CNBC reports. Fink suggested the U.S. is “probably in a recession right now,” but he still expressed some optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook, saying, “In the long run, this is actually more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity” and “the vitality of the United States will persist.” Joe Lonsdale: The Palantir cofounder said on X he has some concerns about the tariffs even though he understands where “some” of the Trump administration’s thinking “is coming from,” and shared a post on tariffs from Viahart founder Molton Hart early Monday, saying Hart’s argument that the “tariffs are structured in the wrong way” by taxing finished products and components at the same rate “reflects a lot of my key concerns about how the tariffs could be done better.” Ken Langone: The Home Depot cofounder and GOP megadonor told the Financial Times he believes Trump has “been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation” and criticized how the tariffs were calculated—saying, “I don’t understand the goddamn formula”—telling the FT it would have been “more manageable and certainly more constructive” for the Trump administration to impose baseline 10% tariffs on foreign imports before starting negotiations. Ray Dalio: Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, wrote Monday the tariffs are based on a broader “breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” He’s still expressed concern about Trump’s tariffs and their “practicality,” however, telling CNBC on Tuesday that while he “agree[s] with the problem” the tariffs are aimed at fixing, “I am very concerned about the solution.” Stanley Druckenmiller: Longtime hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller expressed some optimism about tariffs in an interview with CNBC, referring to them as the “lesser of two evils” versus an income tax—though an unverified social media account believed to belong to Druckenmiller responded to a clip of his interview Sunday, arguing he “do[es] not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Ken Fisher: The Fisher Investments chairman attacked Trump’s tariffs Monday, saying on X the tariff plan is “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools,” predicting it “will fade and fail.” Thomas Peterffy: Contrary to many other billionaires, the Interactive Brokers founder has fully embraced Trump’s tariffs, telling Forbes on Tuesday he “think[s] it gives an opportunity to many entrepreneurs to gear up for producing and inventing either the same things that foreign countries sell us at cheap prices, or proper substitutes for them,” and claiming any price hikes will affect “plastic sh-t from China that is not absolutely necessary for people to have.” More than $10 billion. That’s how much Trump’s top 10 billionaire donors lost in the stock market on Thursday alone, as stocks plunged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement. That’s only a fraction of the $270 billion in total that was wiped off the net worths of the world’s billionaires on Thursday, Forbes calculated, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Musk among those who were the hardest hit. Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk called Trump “the most high tax American President in generations” on Monday. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Tesla shareholder said on X. Peterffy criticized his fellow Trump-friendly billionaires who have spoken out against the president’s tariffs, telling Forbes, “I think that they are short term, greedy, looking after their own pockets.” Trump has dug his heels in on his tariffs and repeatedly doubled down in support of them, even as they’ve spurred chaos in the markets. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social after his tariffs took effect. The president staunchly defended his tariffs to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” in terms of the U.S.’ trade with other countries, and that while other presidents wouldn’t be willing to impose such controversial tariffs, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.” Trump’s tariffs have also garnered criticism from a number of non-billionaires who have typically been sympathetic to the president. Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy has suggested he’s lost up to 15% of his net worth as a result of the stock market plunge from Trump’s tariffs and said “everything’s in the s—-ter” because of the president’s policy—but also has continued to back the president, saying Trump is a “smart guy” even as he dubbed Monday’s stock market plunge “Orange Monday.” “I’m gonna roll with [Trump] Trump has suggested he’s open to negotiating with other countries on their tariffs, saying Monday that discussions with other countries would begin “immediately” and telling reporters he’s open to reaching “fair deals” with other countries that put “America first.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said Trump will negotiate with other countries—likely starting with Japan—but has suggested those negotiations may take a while, telling Fox Business on Monday that all the countries approaching the Trump administration about making deals means “it’s going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June.” The White House denied reports Monday suggesting the administration was considering a 90-day pause, however, decrying the rumor as “fake news,” and Trump said Monday he’s “not looking at” pausing the tariffs unilaterally. Congress could also undo Trump’s tariffs, and bipartisan legislation has been introduced that would require any tariffs the president wants to impose to be approved by Congress. That legislation remains a longshot to pass as of now and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has reportedly urged House Republicans to back Trump’s policy—though some GOP lawmakers are already backing the legislation, and more could follow suit if Trump’s tariffs continue to wreak economic havoc. A Florida-based stationery company is also challenging Trump’s authority to enact tariffs in court—with potentially another major legal challenge on the way this week from business groups—though it remains to be seen how those will play out. Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy during a “Liberation Day” event Wednesday, levying tariffs of 10% and up on imports from nearly all foreign countries—even uninhabited ones. The tariffs fulfill a longtime promise by the president to impose sweeping tariffs in order to restore manufacturing to the U.S. and punish other countries for purportedly unfair trade practices, which Trump has pushed despite economists long warning that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. Billionaires’ criticism of Trump’s tariffs comes after dozens of them backed the president in the November election. More than 50 billionaires expressed support for Trump and billionaires funneled millions into his campaign, even as the now-president made sweeping tariffs a signature plank of his platform.

Title: Trump was touting his Panama victory. Then China stepped in.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to “take back” the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing. The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week. But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China’s national interests. NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was “vital” to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999. Trump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to “reclaim” the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes. Visiting Panama on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s pledge to “take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence.” The U.S. “will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation or integrity,” he said. China, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth’s remarks “irresponsible.” “We advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday. Panama also denies Trump’s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side. On Monday, Panama’s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021. CK Hutchison’s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2. Trump quickly declared victory. “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal. The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “It represents a major victory for the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, adding that is something China “would not want to happen.” Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal. China “firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week. Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China’s national interest. Beijing’s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review “to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.” The original signing date of April 2 came and went last week. While neither BlackRock nor CK Hutchison has publicly commented on the delay, analysts say that in light of the cumulative 54% tariff the United States imposed on China, the ports could be used as a bargaining chip for China to extract concessions from the United States. “What seems more important is China’s effort to gain leverage in negotiations with Trump,” said Angela Zhang, a professor of law at the University of Southern California and author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism.” While the deal does not involve Hutchison’s ports in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, CK Hutchison is publicly listed in Hong Kong, which, Zhang said, could mean China “may have jurisdiction,” even if the transaction “itself occurred offshore.” The review by Beijing’s market regulator is an example of China’s asserting its “long-arm jurisdiction over offshore transactions,” she added. BlackRock declined a request for comment. CK Hutchison did not respond to a request for comment. For Panama, the deal’s failure “would be seen as snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Hernandez-Roy said. “There would be tremendous pressure on Panama to cancel the concessions,” he said, referring to the port operation rights that Hutchison PPC won in 1997. Nevertheless, some analysts say CK Hutchison, which is not financially dependent on the Chinese government, is expected to press ahead with the deal. Li, CK Hutchison’s 96-year-old owner, has been known to draw Beijing’s ire. “Beijing is a bit skeptical about Li’s family. But the family still remains to be one of the most influential, if not the most influential, conglomerates in Hong Kong,” said Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute. “I think what they are actually doing is to diversify the risk, as Trump is getting more and more high-profile about the ports in Panama,” he said. “And during turmoil in the global economy, cash is king.” Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

A digital asset trust bank is like a regular bank, but it’s allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, while Anchorage also specializes in staking, trading, and governance. The world’s largest asset manager may use several custody accounts at the San Francisco-based bank to maintain funds for its $45 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, and $1.8 billion iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, or ETHA, BlackRock stated in the filings. Anchorage’s arrangement with BlackRock underscores the asset manager’s “ongoing risk management approach” and “expanding presence in the digital asset space,” BlackRock stated. BlackRock had already tapped crypto exchange Coinbase as a custodian for its two crypto funds, alongside several other asset managers that launched new products for the industry’s two largest cryptocurrencies by market value last year. “We are excited by the opportunity to set a new standard for tailored access to the digital asset class,” Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. “We are helping BlackRock to meet client demand for today and tomorrow.” So far, Coinbase has been dominant in securing billions of dollars' worth of digital assets for the Wall Street products. Asset manager VanEck custodies its Bitcoin ETF with crypto exchange Gemini, while financial titan Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing its Bitcoin fund. Anchorage entered into a custody arrangement with crypto asset manager 21Shares in September, safeguarding funds for its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The digital asset trust bank also began supporting tokens on layer-1 network Aptos, including BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), in December. BlackRock’s custodial arrangement with Coinbase will not be affected by the firm’s new deal with Anchorage, which received its federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in January 2021, the asset manager said. BlackRock isn’t planning on moving funds to Anchorage from Coinbase, but it can decide how funds are split between the two firms at its “sole discretion,” the asset manager stated.

Other altcoins have also significantly outperformed the overall crypto market in the past 24 hours. Cardano rose 6.3%, far outpacing the Bitcoin price rise of 4%. Meanwhile, Chainlink is up 8% in the same period, posting similar gains to Dogecoin and Avalanche. The vast majority of cryptocurrencies have registered notable price increases today, with the entire crypto market cap up by 1.8% to $2.62 trillion over the past day’s trading. Still, amid ongoing debate and concern about the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, even the best-performing altcoins are down week-on-week and month-on-month. Many high-profile figures within the world of finance, such as hedge fund boss Ray Dalio, are predicting a longer-term slump in equities and the U.S. economy, which some believe could spill over into digital assets. Dogecoin's rise has left it still 9.8% lower than it was this time last week and DOGE is trailing its price from last month by 16.4%. It’s now down roughly 58% since its recent high of $0.36, around the time of Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, AVAX has slipped 9.3% since last week and 10.7% month-on-month. But regardless of the market’s recent boost today, institutional money does seem to have been retreating from crypto assets over the past week. According to data from Farside Investors, money has left the largest Bitcoin ETFs for the past three straight trading days—totaling $268 million. And net ETF flows have been negative for six of the past seven days. Volatility may be here to stay Some analysts are predicting these types of extreme price fluctuations, Dogecoin and otherwise, are likely to persist over the coming weeks and months. Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain options platform Derive.xyz, told Decrypt he expects “this volatility to persist in the coming weeks as the global economy adjusts to a more turbulent environment.” Dawson put this down to “increasing pressure on the market as traders seek to reduce risk exposure amidst this growing volatility.” There is long-term optimism among some of the world’s largest investors, mixed in with expectations of short-term volatility. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders, didn’t rule out the possibility of the crypto market falling “another 20% from here” in a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. But the CEO said that the market turbulence presented "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns NYC to fix crime, filth and schools — or lose even more companies

Full Content:
Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock Inc., warned policymakers in New York City on Monday that crime, cleanliness and a shortage of quality schools have significantly undermined the city’s attractiveness to businesses. “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies,” the 72-year-old Fink said during a candid conversation hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” Fink, who first arrived in New York during the rough-and-tumble 1970s when it was plagued by an economic crisis and widespread urban decay, expressed deep frustration, saying: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” His investment firm, BlackRock, oversees assets totaling approximately $11.6 trillion and is headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards. Fink’s remarks were reported by Bloomberg News. Since late 2019, approximately 160 Wall Street firms, collectively managing nearly $1 trillion in assets, have moved their headquarters out of New York. The city has seen a significant reduction in drugstores, losing nearly 40% over the past decade, with 10% of closures occurring in 2024 alone. Major chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid have reduced their presence, citing factors such as rampant shoplifting and other crimes. Companies like Foot Locker have announced plans to move their headquarters from New York City to other states, aiming to reduce costs. Particularly troubling to Fink is the city’s regulatory environment. He urged lawmakers to reconsider the stringent “pay to play” rules that limit political contributions from individuals and firms conducting business in the city. In New York City, “pay-to-play” rules are a set of campaign finance regulations designed to prevent corruption and ensure transparency in government by limiting political contributions from individuals or companies that do business with the city. “In New York, because we’re so dominated by the financial services area, we are not able to do anything related to helping shape the narrative of this city,” Fink said. “This is one of the reasons why I think the city has been so harmed.” Despite Fink’s criticisms, recent data from the New York Police Department paints a more complex picture of crime in the Big Apple. In fact, the first quarter of 2025 saw substantial decreases in violent crimes, with murders falling by 34.4%, down to 63 incidents from 96 during the same period last year. Shootings also dropped by 23.1% — with incidents decreasing from 182 to 140, according to the NYPD. Moreover, crime on the city’s subway system — a key source of anxiety for many New Yorkers — declined by 18.1%, including zero murders reported during this period for the first time in seven years. Law enforcement officials attributed these improvements to precision policing strategies, emphasizing officer deployment to Violence Reduction Zones, where major crimes have decreased by approximately 25% compared to the previous year. Yet not all statistics reflect improvements, particularly when it comes to quality-of-life concerns in the city compared to the pre-COVID era. Certain crime categories have grown notably, raising concerns among residents. Major felony crimes have increased by 32.0%, including serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, and auto theft. Petty thefts at drugstores have increased by 37.4%, while quality-of-life offenses resulting in summonses, including public drinking and urination, have jumped by 37.7%, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. Rat sightings reported through the city’s 311 hotline have also surged by 48.7% compared to 2019, the news site found. Emergency services have faced their own challenges. Ambulance response times increased by 16%, reflecting delays for FDNY medics in reaching life-threatening situations. Similarly, the NYPD’s response times to active crimes have slowed dramatically by 55.1%, Bloomberg News found in its analysis. Perhaps the most alarming statistic involves public health: Deaths from unintentional drug overdoses have more than doubled, rising by 110.9%, highlighting a severe crisis requiring immediate attention from city leadership. The Post has sought comment from the mayor’s office. Advertisement

Title: The Broad Relevance Of Jamie Dimon’s 2025 Management Learnings

ByMichael Peregrine ByMichael Peregrine, Senior Contributor. Well written CEO letters can serve as a master class on practical leadership lessons. The best-written annual CEO letters typically offer value beyond the company’s investors, to senior leadership teams of companies across industry sectors. They provide information from financial results and projections, to important perspectives on the company’s mission, strategy, culture and decision-making process, among others. All of which can be fodder for consideration by officers and directors of other companies. Among the most popular of these letters have been those written annually by Warren Buffett (Berkshire/Hathaway); Larry Fink (Blackrock) and Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase). And it’s the 2025 version of Mr. Dimon’s annual letter that contains some particularly noteworthy musings on executive practices, under the letter’s heading, “Management Learnings”. They represent an edited version of a “master class” on management lessons he previously provided to his senior executive team, and comment on the need to nurture innovation, ambition and discipline while discouraging complacency, arrogance and bureaucracy: Complacency and Arrogance: Complacency (i.e., the arrogance of being slow to adjust) is cited as a leading cause of corporate failure. Caution is required when elements of complacency are identified, because complacency can lead to the negative developments “that kill companies”. Getting the Numbers Right: The value of proper accounting is cited as a key to corporate success; “to know your numbers: You need to get your numbers right, understand them, analyze them, work them, test them and don't be rote about it.” This includes using an actual budget as a barometer, comparing performance with the best companies, not the peer average, and pursuing a rigorous review of allocated expenses. Full and Constant Competitive Assessment: Great value can be gained from a full and constant assessment of the company’s competition, including organizations that are outside of the company’s immediate business sector. Much can be learned from competitors, customers and employees if leaders are open to recognizing the lessons. Example: Chick-fil-A using drones to figure out how to expedite the drive-thru line. Focus on Controls: Noting that “[H]onest numbers are critical to having great controls,” Mr. Dimon recommends making a practice of continually reviewing financial operational detail, project reporting and audit reports. He also encourages rigorous stress testing and risk management of new products, which “often tend to blow up.” Killing the Bureaucracy: Mr. Dimon describes bureaucracy as a weed that must be continuously gardened. Meetings are cited as a particular example; hold them only when necessary. There should be a purpose to every meeting, and they should conclude with a follow-up list. Avoid the risk of over-collaborating. Acknowledging Mistakes: Effective leaders will recognize that they don’t always get everything right-and when mistakes are made it’s important to acknowledge and learn from them. Among Mr. Dimon’s own, self-described mistakes: underestimating the importance of cloud technology; leaving the wrong person in a job for too long and failing to recognize certain early risk warnings. Defining Culture: Mr. Dimon cites “Ted Lasso” for offering lessons on the important contribution that recognition makes to effective corporate culture, “by recognizing people’s actions day in and day out ‒ not by serving up platitudes.” Recognition is a form of humility and acknowledgment that often directly aligns with corporate values. Team Leadership: Admonishing a colleague to “stay in your lane” can be the cause of major mistakes; i.e., what can occur when people identify something as a problem, but are reluctant to raise it in the right room, for fear of being provocative. “There's nothing wrong with disagreement. Ever.” Achieving Growth and Innovation: Companies that seek to foster growth through forward thinking will evaluate innovative ideas by testing and learning- not through rote analysis, which is often counterproductive to creativity. Management Tricks and Tools: this is essentially a “lighting round” of fascinating yet practical tools of the leadership trade: (i) treat everyone fairly and with respect-from clerks to CEOs; (ii) balance celebrating success with emphasizing negatives and the need for continuous improvement; (iii) write memos yourself-don’t let others write them for you; when you’re asked a question, make sure that you-not someone else-responds; (iv) always make follow-up lists (which, when you think about it, can be distinguished from “to-do” lists); (v) when you attend meetings, give them 100% of your attention; (vi) work smarter, not longer-don’t read the same email multiple times; and (vii) If you don't take care of yourself, it doesn't work. ***** Now that’s a lot of lessons. And to be sure, some may be more applicable to large companies in general, and to the financial services sector in particular, than to the broader commercial sector. But it’s hard not to take away some leadership nuggets from each of Mr. Dimon’s topics, regardless of the industry within someone works. It’s akin to the refrain we often hear from high school and college sports coaches, and how they’re able to apply the lessons they learn from their professional major league counterparts. Ultimately, it’s the same game, the same ball and the same playing field, no matter the level it’s played at. And the lessons are just as relevant.

Title: Trump's Manly Tariffs

Tariffs Liz Wolfe | 4.8.2025 9:30 AM The manufactured pause: Yesterday, news spread that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to its implementation of the most massive round of tariffs, currently set to go into effect tomorrow. The market started climbing back up as the news made the rounds and was relayed by CNBC and Reuters. The only trouble was that this was made up and amplified on X, with no bearing in reality. It looks like the posts came from an actual Fox News interview with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in which he was asked whether the president would "consider a 90-day pause in tariffs." Hassett replied: "The president is going to decide what the president is going to decide." ("I would urge everyone, especially Bill [Ackman], to ease off the rhetoric a little bit," he added. "It's the idea that it's going to be a 'nuclear winter' or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric.") Get your daily news roundup from Liz Wolfe and Reason. Δ An X post from "Hammer Capital" (handle: "yourfavorito") with about 1,000 followers appears to have originated the 90-day pause rumor circa 10:11 a.m. ET. "At about 10:12 a.m., CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, said that cheers had broken out, as stock indices—which were already recovering from early-morning lows—suddenly surged," reports CNN. "'Walter Bloomberg,' an account with a much larger following … copy-and-pasted the original rumor along with a siren emoji at 10:13 a.m." The recovery continued. CNBC and Reuters started circulating the news, having failed to corroborate. Meanwhile, Trump lackeys continued to make the rounds saying extraordinarily dumb things. Peter Navarro, senior White House trade adviser, guarantees no recession. Don't you feel so much better? Meanwhile, the Fox folks are having a blast with the chyrons and touting our return to manufacturing as the thing that will callus up the soft hands of American men, or whatever. Good thing the urban-core men stocked up on Carhartt; they'll need it on the assembly line. I give up. pic.twitter.com/F6TcH2ys0N — Scott Lincicome (@scottlincicome) April 7, 2025 Those inclined to give the administration the most possible credit, and to see 4D chess moves everywhere they look, have theorized that the Trump administration could be imposing such intense tariffs as a bargaining chip to actually bring about more free trade by persuading other countries to come to the negotiating table. This theory appears to be getting less believable by the day. Yesterday, the European Union said it would fully drop its tariffs on American cars and industrial goods if the U.S. would do the same; Navarro turned around and criticized the bloc for its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat exports, saying "You steal from the American people every which way is possible." Then he turned to Vietnam, which he accused of intellectual property theft and killing the American shrimp industry. "When they come to us and say, we'll go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us, because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters," he added. So the theory that this is all a ploy to get way freer trade than before does not look likely at all. Supreme Court says there's a jurisdiction issue: Last night, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to send deportees to prison in El Salvador, but did overturn a lower court's ruling, allowing the administration to continue such deportations for now as the lawyers for the migrants "should have…filed in Texas, where the Venezuelans are being held, rather than a court in Washington," per The New York Times. Make no mistake: This is a very narrow ruling. It's likely more will come soon. "All nine justices agreed that the Venezuelan migrants detained in the United States must receive advance notice and the opportunity to challenge their deportation before they could be removed, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a concurrence," per the Times. Trump is claiming the ruling as much more of a win than it is, loudly proclaiming that yesterday was "A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!" on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay, temporarily pausing a trial judge's attempt to force the administration to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States. This too should not be interpreted as a bigger thing than it is: He appears to be buying and biding time. BREAKING: Chief Justice Roberts has indefinitely blocked the court order requiring Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return tonight. https://t.co/yoeNMJnL8m pic.twitter.com/vx7k4IXIMV — Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) April 7, 2025 Scenes from New York: "Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker who is running for mayor, proposed on Monday a guaranteed basic income program that would be the largest of its kind in the United States," reports The New York Times. "It would aim to help more than 21,000 homeless children and young adults" giving "an initial one-time stipend of $2,500, followed by monthly payments over three years that start at $1,000 per month and then fall to $500 per month." This proposal would cost the city about $430 million over the course of two years. This isn't the first time Adams has tried this approach. On city council, she's spearheaded an effort to spend $1.5 million to support a nonprofit (the Bridge Project) that gives guaranteed income to new moms. But New York City already has a $4 billion budget for homelessness alleviation services; the problem really isn't lack of money.

Title: BlackRock adds new Bitcoin custodian Anchorage Digital alongside Coinbase

BlackRock expands custodial framework for IBIT ETF with Anchorage Agreement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has expanded the custodial structure of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), formalizing Anchorage Digital Bank N.A. as an additional Bitcoin custodian through a new Master Custody Service Agreement. The development, disclosed in a Form 8-K filing dated April 7, 2025, introduces a secondary custodian while Coinbase continues to serve as the primary holder of the trust’s Bitcoin reserves. The agreement establishes a dual-custodian model between BlackRock Fund Advisors, the trust’s administrative trustee, and Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank. There will not be an immediate transfer of assets. Instead, Anchorage will remain on standby as a qualified custodian to support the trust’s risk mitigation protocols. Per the filing, Anchorage is required to utilize cold storage solutions for all private keys, maintain insurance coverage, and comply with provisions that address blockchain forks and indemnification responsibilities. This move is consistent with BlackRock’s positioning of the IBIT ETF as a scalable and resilient product. The presence of a second custodian does not alter the trust’s investment strategy or its underlying operational mechanics, but it introduces greater structural flexibility. The strategic addition of Anchorage may reflect BlackRock’s expectations of increased Bitcoin holdings within IBIT and the need for operational redundancy. Since its launch, IBIT has ranked among the top spot Bitcoin ETFs (and also ETFs overall) in terms of inflows, making risk diversification a logical extension of its custodial setup. Having Anchorage in reserve bolsters resilience against potential disruptions in custody services, whether operational, regulatory, or technical. The selection of Anchorage, a bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), further emphasizes a preference for institutions that meet federal banking standards. Anchorage is among the few crypto-native firms to receive a national trust bank charter, a factor that could enhance the trust’s compliance posture in a regulatory environment still shaping its treatment of digital asset custodians. While the addition of Anchorage introduces new operational options, no assets have yet been transferred. Coinbase remains fully responsible for current custodial functions, and the trust’s overall structure, fee arrangement, and investment objectives remain unchanged. The agreement’s role appears preparatory, building a custodial contingency plan without altering day-to-day fund administration. By preparing a framework for multi-custodian support, BlackRock signals a methodical approach to operational risk while positioning IBIT for long-term institutional participation. This development aligns with much of the community’s desire for diversification of custodial relationships as a baseline standard for fiduciary responsibility.

Title: 'They're not ready': Why BlackRock's Larry Fink is sticking around as CEO
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-fink-blackrock-ceo-succession-new-generation-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T13:24:57Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink is looking forward to the day he's no longer the CEO of BlackRock, but that's not happening just yet. Fink, the 72-year-old cofounder and the only CEO BlackRock has ever had, has long been answering questions about who will succeed him and Rob Kapito, the firm's president, at the $11.5 trillion asset management behemoth. "I look forward to the day when I'm not running it. I do not want to be somebody that's staying on longer than needed," Fink told the Economic Club of New York. The next generation team is in place, he said, but "they're not ready yet." He said that the firm's scale makes "the job harder" and that he "fundamentally believes" the team immediately below him and Kapito will take over in the future. The group of executives likely to succeed Fink includes Rob Goldstein, the firm's chief operating officer; Martin Small, the chief financial officer and global head of corporate strategy; Rachel Lord, the head of international; and Stephen Cohen, who was promoted to chief product officer last year. This lineup saw a shake-up earlier this year following the surprise exit of Mark Weidman, who, along with Goldstein, had been seen as a top contender to replace Fink. Weidman joined the Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial as its president on Monday. Salim Ramji, another executive considered a prospective successor, left BlackRock last January and joined Vanguard as its chief executive in July. Fink said he was proud of the BlackRock "diaspora," which has seen firm leaders take up CEO posts at other asset managers. Despite once opposing staying on as chairman — he said it would be a disaster in a 2017 interview — Fink said he's now open to staying close to help but likely not for long. Fink also touched on conditions in New York City, saying he used to believe working and living in the city was an honor and that his taxes were being put to good use, but because of crime, filth, and the declining quality of services, he said he "doesn't feel that way anymore." "You know, you're seeing more and more of your firm's population are asking, 'Can I move to other places?' because they're worried about the cost of housing here, the crime, the cost of education, all the things that are that are facing us." He said that BlackRock's New York employee base, with the exception of the acquisitions group, has remained at around 4,000 over the past seven years. He wants business leaders to "reclaim the glory of New York City." While he didn't name a mayoral candidate he was looking to back in the coming November election, Fink said he was a fan of Ritchie Torres, a congressman representing the Bronx who's expressed interest in a gubernatorial run. "He's not running for mayor, but he is one of the key members of Congress representing the Bronx who is really trying to make a difference," Fink said. Jump to

Title: Pro-Trump Billionaires Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

During the 2024 presidential election, many people warned that Donald Trump, a 78-year-old former reality TV star with an extensive track record of failed businesses, was not the person best equipped to handle the American economy. For some reason, billionaire Bill Ackman did not believe them. Instead, he endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign, going on to make very public vows of confidence in Trump’s leadership. Now, for his efforts, Ackman and others of his ilk have been rewarded with a very special prize: a cratering stock market and the worst economic downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. Ackman’s apparent regret has been on full display for the past 48 hours or so, as the billionaire has tweeted his way through the stock market’s increasingly dire collapse. “To state the obvious, it does not help our countryâs and our presidentâs negotiating position to be trying to strike deals while our market is collapsing,” the billionaire wrote flailingly on Sunday. “Whoever is recommending that idea to President @realDonaldTrump should be fired now.” Indeed, Ackman seems to have been under the delusion that Trump was only using the threat of tariffs to bring various nations to the negotiating table for trade deals. Since it has become apparent that Trump really doesn’t know or care whether he’s bluffing or not, Ackman’s tune has changed drastically, and he seems to be about two tweets away from a coronary. He is in good company. Lots of folks on Wall Street are freaking out right now, and other members of the billionaire class have come out to disavow the White House’s economic policy. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” Ackman worried on Sunday. “The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out, negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country.” Ackman went on: “If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.” The Financial Times reported Monday that Ackman’s primary investment fund, Pershing Square Holdings, has seen a 15 percent drop in shares this year. The fund’s holdings in “Nike, Mexican-style fast-food chain Chipotle, asset manager Brookfield and Alphabet have taken the biggest hits since the start of the year,” FT writes. https://t.co/tTxLfGaSdi pic.twitter.com/TrM2i2Si2k — Woke Putin ð (@ripplebrain) April 7, 2025 Other wealthy individuals and former Trump supporters have come out of the woodwork to criticize the administration’s tariff policy, which is largely credited for one of the most dramatic market downturns of the past fifty years. Elon Musk, Trump’s DOGE, has very quietly expressed concern over the tariff policies, while his brother, Kimbal Musk, has been more openly critical:Â “Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations. Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Musk brother recently posted on X. Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has made efforts to get into Trump’s good graces in recent months, has said that the tariffs could depress the stock market by another 20 percent. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we areÂ probably in a recession right now,” Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Billionaire Ken Fisher, who was once listed as one of Trump’s backers, also came out to blast the tariff policy this week, calling it “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools.” One would have to assume that there are other plutocrats who are currently kicking themselves over their previous support for Trump, as a new report claims that the world’s richest people (including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos) saw their net worth plunge by over $200 billion in the course of a day due to the tariffs. The sympathy they deserve is, of course, limited.

Title: This Closed-End Fund Has 1 Big Danger (Its Name Is Elon Musk)

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 5: White House Senior Advisor to the President and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon ... More Musk departs the U.S. Capitol Building on March 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Musk was meeting with Republican senators at a closed door lunch. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) I often talk about high-yielding closed-end funds that are great buys because, well, there are plenty of CEFs that are. Yes, even in unprecedented times like these. That’s because the best CEFs offer three things we love: Still, every once in a while, a CEF comes across my desk that’s an obvious one to sell (or avoid if you don’t already hold it). It pays to look into overly risky CEFs like these because they can teach us a lot about what to look for, and what to stay well away from, when analyzing these (typically) high-yielding income plays. With that in mind, there’s one fund out there right now that every investor should avoid unless, like Austin Powers, Danger is your middle name. That would be a closed-end fund called the Destiny Tech100 Fund (DXYZ). Now right off the top, you might wonder why I’m panning DXYZ, after the fund returned 344% since its inception a little over a year ago: DXYZ Total Returns Let’s get into why this one should be nowhere near your portfolio today. For starters, as you can probably tell from the name, DXYZ focuses on tech. But almost all of the fund’s performance has come from its market price appreciating. That’s important because with CEFs, we have to consider the performance of both the market price and the underlying portfolio, because the two can be quite different. And if you look at DXYZ’s total NAV return (the return of its underlying portfolio, in other words) over the last six months, we can see that its NAV has risen just 25.1%, while its market price has shot up a lot more, according to the CEF Connect fund screener. DXYZ Price/NAV Returns In other words, almost all of the fund’s gains are coming from its premium to its intrinsic value. This is a danger sign because DXYZ trades at a 512% premium to NAV as I write, again according to CEF Connect. That’s not a typo. To put this in perspective, the second-largest premium for a publicly traded CEF is the 91% premium on the abrdn Global Income Fund (FCO). And even that premium is in the stratosphere because as I mentioned a second ago, the average CEF trades at a 5% discount. So DXYZ’s premium is, simply put, absurd. Now, there are more details to consider here. For one, DXYZ doesn’t report its net asset value daily, as almost all other CEFs do. That’s another concern for investors. Management would probably respond that this criticism is unfair because DXYZ invests in a lot of private equity. And that response is fair: Private assets tend to get marked to market infrequently, so there just isn’t a daily change in the price. But the fund could still report its NAV daily, since it does hold some common and preferred shares, and the price of those do fluctuate daily. But the bigger concern is the overall decline we’ve seen in publicly traded US stocks this year, along with an increase in volatility. While I remain bullish on stocks (and stock-focused CEFs) in the long term, I am worried about more volatility in the short term. That’s a poor setup for DXYZ’s heavy focus on private tech companies because it means less liquidity for those private investments. That, in turn, means less cash for private-equity investors. Which means we’re likely to see more markdowns of these assets. None of this is good for DXYZ’s approach to markets. And there’s another risk the fund is not pricing in: Elon Musk. DXYZ Holdings This is not at all a political statement, but simply a fact: Elon Musk's new role in government is controversial. I likely don’t have to tell you that this is being priced into shares of Tesla (TSLA) now. SpaceX hasn’t priced in the Musk factor because, again, private companies aren’t revalued often. And one could argue that SpaceX, which depends on government contracts, stands to benefit from Musk’s close relationship to President Donald Trump. Of course, Trump won’t be president forever, and the market will likely react when his term is nearing an end. With DXYZ so heavily weighted toward SpaceX, that’s when the fund could see its premium evaporate. Or its premium could disappear earlier if Trump and Musk were to have a falling out, say. Or if Musk’s relationship to Trump is already priced into SpaceX and the economic benefit of that relationship turns out to be less than the market thinks. There are a lot of risky “ifs” in this fund right now! All of this means it surely does not deserve the biggest premium, by a huge margin, in the CEF world. And there’s more. DXYZ, you see, pays no dividend while, as mentioned a second ago, the average CEF yields nearly 8%. Other CEFs with large investments in private companies have outsized income streams, like the 16.2% yield on the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). BTX also trades at a 5.8% discount to NAV. DXYZ’s other holdings entail high risk, too: Axiom Space has been financially struggling for months, UK-based Revolut is growing profits nicely, but the British economy is showing weakness. On average, DXYZ’s investments are losing money, and the market value of those holdings will eventually reflect that if these companies don’t start making a profit. Finally, let’s do some quick math. At a 512% premium to NAV, as of this writing, there’s a risk of an 84% decline in the fund’s market price for it to reach par. And, again, remember that the average CEF trades at a discount right now. When there’s a market panic, CEF premiums tend to evaporate, so this isn’t a hollow risk. The bottom line here is that DXYZ is one of the riskiest CEFs out there, if not the riskiest. There’s no reason to expose ourselves to that risk when we’ve got many other top-quality CEFs to choose from that yield 8% and more. And we can get those at a discount, too.

Title: Markets aren't out of the woods yet

Good morning. Boomers told BI they are preparing for the worst as they worry about what cuts to the Social Security Administration could mean for their benefits and access to resources. "All I can do is cross my fingers and hope," one said. In today's big story, the markets briefly entered bear-market territory on Monday — a day that saw "fake news" trigger a $4 trillion swing in a matter of minutes. What's on deck Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was asked if he thinks a recession is coming. His response: We're in it. Tech: The market for face computers still isn't there — and could actually shrink this year. Business: One US sector could suffer big-time from Trump's punitive tariffs on Canada. But first, a near-miss for the markets. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A $4 trillion swing. An entry into bear-market territory. A new tariff threat. Yesterday was a wild day for Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell as much as 4.7% into the bear-market zone before briefly spiking on a tariff-suspension report the White House called "fake news." Roughly $4 trillion in market value was added to the index in 34 minutes because of the report. Then the "fake news" designation sent the market back down. The move demonstrated just how desperate investors were for relief from a relentless three-day stock rout. The S&P 500 ended the day above bear-market territory, but markets aren't out of the woods yet. The US and China could be heading for a long standoff in their trade war, risking collateral damage for economies and markets the world over, BI's Huileng Tan writes. On Monday, Trump hit China with a fresh threat of an additional 50% in tariffs — on top of a total 54% he announced since taking office — if Beijing doesn't withdraw the retaliatory tariffs it announced on Friday. Today, things intensified further. China's Commerce Ministry called Trump's latest threat "a mistake on top of a mistake." "If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end," said a ministry spokesperson. 1. Billionaires are turning on Trump over tariffs. The ultrawealthy were bullish on Trump around election season, but now they're souring on him after seeing trillions wiped from the stock market. They've seen their net worths plummet during the sell-off — and they've had enough. 2. Larry Fink says the recession might already be here. The BlackRock commander-in-chief said most CEOs in his orbit agree that we're "probably in a recession right now." But he doesn't think you should sell your stocks just yet. 3. Tesla's latest plunge has proved Trump's commerce secretary wrong. Last month, Howard Lutnick said a $235 share price was the lowest Tesla would ever go and that they'd "never be this cheap again." Shares on Monday dropped as low as $214. 1. The face-tech market just ain't happening. Big Tech companies like Apple and Meta keep betting on face computers like AR and VR goggles, even though customers don't seem to be interested. This year, the market for face tech might even shrink — but Meta's still optimistic. 2. A logistics giant is turning its warehouses into robot testing labs. GXO is betting big on the next frontier of physical AI, putting humanoid robots from three different firms to work in its warehouses. GXO's chief automation officer said the tech could theoretically complete multiple tasks in the future. 3. Trump tariffs are all about Taiwan. Tariffs are Trump's attempt to shift the global economy away from Chinese manufacturing. That's because Taiwan, home to TSMC, is at the heart of global supply chains. If China invades Taiwan, the economic shock could make last week look tame. 1. The next big loser in Trump's beef with Canada. Canadian investors have put some $184 billion in US commercial real estate over the last decade. Some are wealthy pension funds such as Oxford Properties Group, a partner in Hudson Yards. Trump's punitive tariffs are endangering the pipeline of steady Canadian cash to those projects. 2. The Okta CEO's hot take on the job market for software engineers. Even as AI shakes up the field, Todd McKinnon expects more demand for software engineers in the next five years, not less. Here's why. 3. DOGE's targets in its consultancy crackdown. From DEI to energy-related contracts, BI analyzed five government contracts DOGE has axed. It shows a major realignment in how the federal government is working with consultants.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week, really an extra, extra special guest. Lisa Shallet, chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley has had a number of fascinating roles in Wall Street, which is kind of amusing considering she had no interest in working on Wall Street, and yet she was CEO and chairman at Sanford Bernstein. She was CIO at Merrill Lynch Asset Management, and now CIO at both Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and runs their asset allocation models and their outsourced chief investment officer models. So she’s seen this industry from all sides. Not only is CEO running operations, running a a substantial firm, but as CIO for Morgan Stanley is over $6 trillion. She’s directly responsible for a hundred billion dollars. There are a few people in this industry who understand what it’s like to work with institutions, work with families, work with individuals, as well as work with advisors and brokers the way Lisa does. She, she absolutely has a unique background and a unique perch on, on wealth management and what’s going on in the world. I found this conversation to be absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Morgan Stanley’s. Lisa Schack. Lisa Shalett: Thank you. It’s great to be here, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: It’s great to have you. I’ve really been looking forward to this conversation. You, you have an absolutely bonkers cv. We’ll, we’ll get into that in a little bit. 00:01:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m just old. Barry Ritholtz: Better than the alternative I like to say. Right? Yes. But let’s start with your background in your career, applied mathematics and economics from Brown and then a Harvard MBA. That sounds like you were on a career path to a Wall Street Quant from early on. Tell us what, what the career plans were. Lisa Shalett: Not at all. Right. I, I, in college, I was a drive time disc jockey. I, you know, abhorred the idea of working on Wall Street. And so, you know, coming outta school once I realized that journalists and folks in radio don’t make much money in the long run, no offense, Barry Ritholtz: This is my side hustle. Not offended at all. Lisa Shalett: Not to anyone around here. You know, I thought I was gonna take the high road and, and be a management consultant. So that’s what I did for the first job. Barry Ritholtz: So what changed your mind to say, all right, let me, let me go see what these finance bros on Wall Street are all about. Lisa Shalett: Yeah, so, you know, I, I did the consulting thing both before and after business school. And, you know, fundamentally I was never home. I was traveling and on an airplane all the time. I was literally arriving back home Saturday mornings, leaving Sunday nights. You know, I was starting to hit that, you know, those magic numbers in the thirties when women are like, if I don’t get it done now, it’s not now or never it’s not, it’s now or never. So I took the plunge, I quit. I did not have a job, and I said, okay, I am gonna go out there and, and see what’s going on. I knew that I wanted to work with clients. That was one of the pieces of the consulting gig that appealed to me. I wanted to work with super smart people. Also, something I had loved in that career. And I, and I really just, you know, wanted to be somewhere where I was constantly learning and growing. Right. And I’m a New Yorker, so I was coming home. Most of the search people at that time, you know, said to me, the only place to go if you wanna do that is Wall Street. I kind of balked and they said, but there’s just this one place, there’s this one place. And the one place for, for those on Wall Street in, in the mid nineties that was very special, was very independent, was Sanford Bernstein. I walked in the door and I literally fell in love. I can honestly tell you wow, from the minute I walked in the door, I knew I was home and I always thought I would die there. But obviously, you know, life is long and stuff happens. But it was a wonderful, wonderful, it was the seminal chapter in my career. Barry Ritholtz: I’m trying to remember, did they get rolled up with PIMCO and from Alliance? Is that right? SoThat’s how became Alliance Bernstein? Lisa Shalett: So Sanford C Bernstein was independent. When founder Mr. Bernstein passed, we needed to settle his estate and a decision was made to, to merge with Alliance Capital, which was a growth shop at the time, we thought it would be synergistic. ’cause the asset management business of Sanford Bernstein, as everyone I think knows, was a deep value shop. Right? And so that merger happened, I wanna say somewhere in the, in the early two thousands we became Alliance Bernstein. And you know, then, you know, we kind of wrote it to till the, the great financial crisis and our deep value exposure to financials kind of helped unwind us quite a bit. And I think, you know, Alliance Bernstein really spun for quite a long time. It took, you know, a long, long time to get out of that mess. I left ’cause I got tired of firing all my friends. Oof. Barry Ritholtz: That’s tough. Because you were not just in the investing side, correct. You were chair and CEO Chief Executive Officer. Yes. That’s gotta be a very difficult experience right. In the teeth of the financial crisis. Lisa Shalett: It, it was god awful. And really, you know, the trauma was when Lou Sanders, who at the time had been the storied CEO of the firm. He had been my personal rabbi when he was asked to step down. And, you know, therein began, I think the unraveling and, and a little bit of the, the loss of that, you know, cultural juice that had kind of historically made that firm special. Barry Ritholtz: So you leave Sanford Bernstein and then, which had really become Alliance Bernstein end up at Merrill Lynch, where eventually your same role Chief Investment Officer for Bank of America Merrill Lynch Wealth Management first, what did, was there still remnants of Mother Merrill when you joined post merger? There Lisa Shalett: Were certainly remnants. So, you know, just to, to reframe, you know, folks who are Wall Street historians will understand this chapter. One of the reasons I went to Merrill is I was recruited by one of my best friends, who is Sally Crotch? Sally. Oh really? Sally and I grew up at Sanford Bernstein together Oh. As baby analysts. And at that time she was running, you know, the Merrill Lynch brokerage business for B of A. And she hired me to come in and, and be the chief investment officer at Wealth Management. If you remember, during this period of time was right after the financial crisis, the worst of it, it was 20 10, 20 11. And, you know, she had kind of gone to bat very controversially asking the bank to protect clients on, on some of the products that had gone bad. And that didn’t go so well for her. And within four months of of my arrival, she actually heard that she was fired on tv. We were together in her office. And there was literally a chiron on the bottom of the screen that says, you know, CRO check to leave Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Barry Ritholtz: Well, that was sweet of them to do it that way… You know, I have a vivid recollection from the people I, we, we were talking about Josh Frankel and Dave Rosenberg, and I know a lot of Rich Bernstein, all these people I know from the 2000 Era Merrill Lynch. And one of the fascinating things about Sallie Krawcheck was her defense of the Merrill Lynch brands Post merger. And she really helped turn around a malaise, just a lack of office morale amongst here you have this storied name that was picked up on the cheap during the financial crisis and was wildly underperforming as an organization. And full credit to her for really saving Merrill Lynch as a name and turning I tens of thousands of people’s jobs around. She really did yeoman’s work there, didn’t she? Lisa Shalett: Yes, absolutely. Barry Ritholtz: So you become Chief Investment Officer for Bank of America Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. What did you take away from that? You, you’ve had this role in several organizations. What was really unique and special about Bank America Merrill Lynch? Lisa Shalett: Yeah, so what, you know, when I was running the wealth management business, you know, reflecting on my experience with Sanford Bernstein. Sanford Bernstein was what we call a closed shop, right? All the clients were getting proprietary Sanford Bernstein asset Management product. And when I arrived at Merrill Lynch, it was really my first exposure to really entrepreneurial, extremely talented and aggressive financial advisors who were operating with what we in the industry call an open architecture platform, right? Where they could, you know, kind of place best of breed product with their clients. And so that opened a whole new world for me in thinking about asset allocation and thinking about advice and thinking about active and passive constructions together, thinking about alternatives. And so, you know, what made Merrill extraordinarily special were the financial advisors who were just spectacular, to your point, the thundering hurt. Barry Ritholtz: Yep, yep. Remember those, those ads from like the sixties and seventies on tv, they were absolutely unique. So culturally, I have to think Sanford Bernstein and Merrill Lynch were both very different. What did you bring from those two organizations to your work at Morgan Stanley, either philosophically or cultural? Yeah, Lisa Shalett: So I think from, from my time at, at Sanford Bernstein, I like to think I brought, you know, kind of my love of original research, my love of, you know, that independent streak, that desire to really, you know, call out conflict of interest and say, no, this is, you know, this is what the numbers really tell you. I like to think I brought that, I think, you know, from Merrill, it was really that appreciation of how do you work through financial advisor? So in, you know, as a chief investment officer, how do you earn the trust of financial advisors to have influence, right? Because they’re what stand between you and the client. And so, you know, I think, I think I started that process I, in my career at, at Merrill, I think in many ways I still wake up every day and I think I’ve got more to learn in terms of how to be a better partner to financial advisors today at Morgan Stanley. Barry Ritholtz: And, and what is kind of interesting, given the open architecture at Merrill and the proprietary work at Alliance Bernstein, Morgan Stanley’s, a little bit of both, you, you have conscient research and a number of people running their own funds that are specific to Morgan Stanley as well as the open architecture. How, how do you look at the combination of, of both closed and open together? Yeah. Lisa Shalett: Well, look, I, I think it, it does a lot of things. First, it avails me of some of the best colleagues on the planet, right? So I’m surrounded not only by folks in the wealth management business, but obviously I’m attached to one of the best equity and trading franchises globally. And then to your point, you know, connected to PMs that, you know, are walking the floors with me. But look, you know, I wanna be really clear when I think about my CLI clients, we’re arms length. So proprietary product might be appropriate for them if they’re open to it. If on the other hand they say, conflicts of interest matter a lot to me, I want everything to be totally transparent. We have that, those options as well. So, you know, I think about it as, as you know, we, we work with clients, we do what clients are in their best interest. And, and I know it sounds a little bit like an advertisement, but I really believe that, Barry Ritholtz: Well the the next question, the obvious question is, who are the clients? Are they institutions? Are they households? Are they a little bit of both. Lisa Shalett: Yeah. So as you may know, Barry, you know, over the last, you know, really decade since since Gorman acquired Smith Barney, we’ve been expanding our footprint in terms of the client segments that we are focused on serving really exponentially. So while you might once upon a time have thought about, you know, the Morgan Stanley financial advisors as, as, you know, serving that ultra high net worth, you know, core client, you know, now we’re, you know, serving folks in the mass market through E-Trade. We’re serving family offices, we’re serving institutions, we’ve done acquisitions in, in the stock plan businesses, in the retirement businesses. I, I, you noted in my bio that I, I run help run one of our OCIO businesses, our outsource, where we’re working with foundations and endowments and family offices. So now we’re everywhere and we’re serving every type of wealth client internationally, domestic self-directed through a brokerage account all the way through complete discretionary. Barry Ritholtz: I recall back in the day Morgan Stanley as well, they’re kind of a Goldman Sachs wannabe. And, and that is no longer the case. It’s the best of Goldman, the best of Merrill. And on this is really inside baseball stuff. So I apologize to, to listeners, but on the league tables to say who’s number one in underwriting, who’s number one in attracting new wealth management, who’s number one in self-directed. Like you guys are competitive across the board. And it’s not like the old days where Goldman has a good year in their, you know, take the top spot everywhere. That doesn’t seem to happen anymore. It seems like the industry has become so competitive, you want to be in the top five or top 10. But the days of, you know, taking num number one with a bullet across all these different areas, they really seem to have faded. Lisa Shalett: Yeah, they have. I mean, I think that ours is a business in almost every segment that requires a lot of scale. And as you know, developing scale very often means investing aggressively in tech, investing aggressively in talent. And you gotta pick your spots, right? And so, you know, to your point, I think every, you know, segment today is a little bit of a gunfight. I like to think that, you know, in core wealth management, Morgan Stanley, and, and you know, where we’ve come, you know, first under James Gorman and now hopefully under, under Ted Pick’s leadership is really, you know, differentiating us and allowing us to pull away from the pack, at least in wealth management. Barry Ritholtz: And you, you mentioned the investment in technology and people and the ability to scale at your size. And there’s only, you know, a dozen or two companies that can make this claim that flywheel begins to become very self-reinforcing. And you have the ability to just continue to add divisions to fill in. Oh, we’re a little soft here. Let’s, let’s bulk this up a little bit and put a little muscle on it. ’cause we have the ability to offer these services to all our clients. What’s it been like watching the, how long have you there? You’re there almost a decade, Lisa Shalett: So, and, and from 2012 to 2025, that’s a huge run. Barry Ritholtz: A a lot of big financial players, Vanguard, BlackRock, go down the list, have really added some heft. So is Morgan Stanley, what’s it been like watching that over the past decade plus? Lisa Shalett: Yeah, it’s been extraordinarily exciting for us. Obviously you always wanna be working in a growth business. And so, you know, we’ve been in a situation where we’re hiring people, which is always exciting. We’re going after new types of clients, new problems, new situations, which keeps you on your toes and keeps you growing and, you know, really completely new business segments. I mean, I can’t tell you how, to your point, that flywheel between moving up market into institutions feeds your self-directed business. I mean, let me just give you an example. Let’s assume that we are administering a stock plan for a large corporate client. Now we’re going in and we’re saying to that corporate client, instead of, you know, having a financial advisor going to the country club on Saturday, acquiring a client monoi mono one at a time, we’re now wa walking into a C- suite and saying to that CFO or that chief talent officer, Hey, can we provide all of your employees with a financial wellness program? Can we give every single one of your employees a free financial plan? Can we give every single one of your employees a account or advice, you know, to their first, you know, purchase in a 5 29 account? Things like that, where suddenly you’re acquiring clients at scale. 00:18:46 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about Morgan Stanley. We mentioned you were previously at Alliance Bernstein, and then you were at Bank America Merrill Lynch. What led you to make the jump to, to Morgan Stanley? 00:19:00 [Speaker Changed] So I had, when, as I noted, I’d gone to work at Merrill very much to, to partner with my very good friend Sally Crotch. And after she had left, I made the decision that without her there I kind of felt among the, you know, the thundering herd without a rabbi, if you will. And I left. And at that point I really thought I was gonna do my own thing. I thought I was gonna do something entrepreneurial. I thought I might join an RIA or form my own RIA at that point. And I just, I got a call from Greg Fleming. Greg Fleming was one of the co-presidents at Morgan Stanley at the time. And he said, look, you know, I have a lot of contacts over there at Merrill Lynch. The financial advisors really love you. You know, come on in and meet our team. 00:19:59 And so I did. And you know, I had a very similar feeling to that feeling I had when I first went into Bernstein of, you know, these are just great people and I would enjoy working with the people. And you know, before I knew it there I was, you know, sitting next to Mike Wilson, who I know, you know, Mike was taking a, a stint, a rotation through wealth management. And, you know, I joined, I joined him to, to build the team and, and really, you know, create the platform that we have today. When, when Morgan Stanley and and Smith Barney were merging, there was really no centralized CIO office. It was the only place that, that, that talent was coming from was from Smith Barney, from the Smith Barney side. And so we wanted to recraft a more Morgan Stanley integrated firm offering. And so I joined Mike Wilson to, to help build that. 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk a little bit about what goes into managing a hundred plus billion dollars in assets. How do you develop that? How do you think about asset allocation and how do you think about the end clients, given how broad your audience and clients are? How do you create a, a, a set of options that checks all the boxes that, you know, you need to check to do this right? But also gives a broad variety of clients what they’re looking for? 00:21:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so, so Barry, for us asset allocation, all asset allocation starts with financial planning and all financial planning starts with the client. But you can’t do a financial plan without having what we call capital market assumptions. You know, what do, what do we think every asset class is gonna do over the next 3, 5, 10, 20 years? Our customization of asset allocation really starts with financial planning. That is the linchpin. We fundamentally believe that you’ve gotta understand a client’s cash flow, that the client has to understand their own cash flows. You know, one of the things that I know, you know, having worked with a lot of clients is very often clients don’t know themselves. Right? The, the good old fashioned, Hey, I’m kind of aggressive, I’m kind of conservative. Those are such non-normative terms. You never know. Are we talking about politics? Are we talking about, you know, how you dress? 00:22:27 [Speaker Changed] Usually you’re talking about whatever the market did in the past six months, and that’s what the 00:22:31 [Speaker Changed] Determiner And so, so working through the behavioral pieces, the getting to know your client, the working through a plan with them, really getting into what are their hopes, wishes, dreams, you know, what does money mean to them? Why have, have they accumulated it? How have they accumulated it? What do they hope their legacy will be? Does it have to do with a charity a, you know, a cause a family member or members and build a plan from there. 00:23:00 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really quite interesting. So, since you’ve joined Morgan Stanley, and I’m gonna assume this isn’t a coincidence, their focus has increasingly been on the wealth management side of the business, which was a big change to the 1990s and the two thousands. Tell us a little bit about why and how this focus shifted and what your role is in that. 00:23:25 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So look, I, I think, you know, this is, I think history is going to be extraordinarily kind to James Gorman. I, I think James, I I feel so extraordinarily lucky to have served in the firm while he was the CEOI think, you know, strategically, you know, back during the financial crisis, he developed a vision. And that vision was, I believe that the wealth management business is a growth oriented business. I believe it needs scale. And I believe that when combined with a more cyclical market space, businesses or the, the, the banking based businesses can add ballast and create shareholder value. And I think that he embraced that vision. And that vision had kind of three chapters to it. The first was, you know, let’s buy Smith Barney and get physical scale, right? Just the physical scale of a large number of advisors. Let’s invest aggressively in technology to, to support those advisors. 00:24:32 I think the, the second part of that growth was to say, let’s transform how we serve our clients and the client segments that we serve. And they started to explore these other acquisitions. First the acquisitions of these stock plan businesses, which are essentially tech businesses, tech platform businesses, but would allow us to go from acquiring clients one at a time to in groups. And then, you know, the last piece of the strategy was really, you know, let’s, let’s go after E-Trade and Eaton Vance and acquire those. And then we’ll have the machinery so that you can, you know, acquire clients at, at the early stages of their life cycle, allow them to be self-directed and ultimately graduate to advice so that your financial advisors actually constantly have a source of new clients, of new wealth clients. That they don’t have to be at the country club every single weekend. 00:25:36 [Speaker Changed] So, so what you’re describing is you’re starting with clients that have no minimum and they’re self-directed at E-Trade. I don’t mean this in a, a negative way. They sort of move up or graduate to a little more advice, full service. They want a financial plan, they want some advice, they want to think about whether it’s saving for a home or college or, or retirement. And then the next step up seems to be full on wealth management, where you’re dealing with philanthropy, generational wealth transfer, a lot of bells and whistles including estate planning tax. You guys offer the full suite of services. 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And, and I think one of the things that a lot of folks don’t know about us is we’re the 800 pound gorilla in actually offering alternatives to private wealth clients. You know, we are larger than some of our well-known competitors by a factor. And so what that means is we’re now in a position where literally about 80% of the alternatives that I would show you as a client are either, you know, first look, meaning we’re getting the first look or, or best price by a lot. 00:26:52 [Speaker Changed] So it’s funny because you, you mentioned Gorman taking over from his predecessor Yeah, 00:26:58 [Speaker Changed] John Mack. 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] John Mack, who I’ve had on the show who was just delightful. But the Mack era of Morgan Stanley seemed to have more successfully navigated the financial crisis than many of their competitors. And part of me can’t help but feel that coming out of the crisis in better shape than so many others really allowed Morgan Stanley to blow up over the next 15 when, when everybody else had blown up during the financial crisis in the bad way. They really bulked up in the good way following that. Is, is that a fair assessment? That 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] That is a fair assessment, Barry? I I think I look at it in a very particular way, a host of, of our competitors were forced, quote unquote into the arms of the big banks, right? So the, the B of a Merrill situation, right. And had 00:27:55 [Speaker Changed] Bear Sterns, 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] JP 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] Morgan 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] Chase. Exactly. You had, you had, you know, Citi had to make choices around Smith Barney. It was very, very hard what, what Mack and James Gorman did to rescue Morgan Stanley. And literally they talk about it as an overnight rescue where half the employees were packing the boxes just like everybody else. And the other half were, were on the phone with colleagues in Japan. And as you may recall, what saved Morgan Stanley was a huge equity infusion from MUFG, from Mitsubishi Right. Financial group. And what was wonderful about that is not only was it premised on a, a fantastic, you know, partnership, but it was an arms length partnership that allowed the business to be rescued but not devoured. Right. And I think that for some of our competitors who were suddenly during the great financial crisis inside, you know, systemically important banks, their needs, right? Just by sheer dent of size got squashed a little bit because the bank obviously had, you know, the CEOs of, of Citi, the CEO of chase, the CEO at wells, the CEO at B of a, you know, they’re sitting there with the Fed and, and and SEC every five minutes. Now, I’m not saying Morgan Stanley wasn’t at those meetings, but the stakes were different because we weren’t a commercial bank with a balance sheet the size that those guys had. 00:29:29 [Speaker Changed] But even more importantly is you’re at Alliance Bernstein, Bernstein gives up control in the merger you’re at Merrill, Merrill gives up control in the merger, third time’s a charm when you end up at Morgan Stanley Mitsubishi had a substantial stake, but they didn’t take a controlling stake. And the local US based management were able to continue making the choices they made. I, I have to think that was just a giant home run investment for MUFG that has to be just a giant winner for them. It 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] 100%. And I, and you know, I think if, again, if you go back and look at it, you know, where where are the Morgan Stanley stock bottomed and, and where we are today. I, like I said, I think the history books are going to be quite kind to Mr. Gorman. 00:30:19 [Speaker Changed] And, you know, you, you talked about some of the acquisitions, Smith Barney, Eaton Vance, I’m trying to remember the direct indexer you bought. I didn’t know if it came through Eaton Vance. 00:30:31 [Speaker Changed] Yes. 00:30:31 [Speaker Changed] Was that parametric? Am I ing 00:30:33 [Speaker Changed] That correctly? Yes. So, yeah, so fantastic memory, Barry, because that has been transformational as you know, indexing tax management, direct indexing, or the ability to customize our, you know, all demands and, and it’s a tech, it’s a very tech heavy business. So parametric was buried inside of Eaton Vance. It is, you know, definitely diamonds in the rough that we got. And now is a, is a key capability offering within the, within the suite of products. 00:31:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Real, really fascinating. So let’s talk a little bit about what’s going on these days. And I wanna start with a quote of yours that I really like. We’re all long-term investors until the market goes down and we’re recording this in the midst of a pretty healthy sell off in, in February and and March, especially now that the new North American tariffs seem to be taking place. Tell us what, why do we give up our long-term perspectives once the market starts heading south? 00:31:40 [Speaker Changed] So there’s the emotions and then there’s the math, right? So what I always say is that, you know what the Nobel Prize winners and behavioral economics will tell you is that emotionally losses hurt four to five times more than gains satisfy. And that’s actually intuitively appropriate because typically our wealth we feel has taken blood, sweat, and tears to acquire or accumulate. And when we experience a loss, right, a 50% loss can happen right? In a very short period of time. But to round trip and recover our high watermark, we’ve gotta be up a hundred percent, right? Right. Which may take us twice to three times as long. And so the math is asymmetric, the emotions are asymmetric and fear as we know, just the same way when things are running hard and you feel like you’ve got the FOMO and the missing out, it’s greed when you know there’s a lot of red on the screen, people are, you know, your stomach’s, you know, totally seizing up. And it’s about fear. I don’t wanna experience loss. I don’t wanna have to make a decision of what do I do here. 00:32:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The asymmetries are really fascinating. I am not a fan of Vegas or casinos, but I go there as a sociologist and I always find it amusing that right off the casino floor is a big, beautiful jewelry store filled with lots of expensive watches and ’cause those gains, it’s house money, it’s ephemeral, but losses are an existential thread. Correct. It really feels like the world is coming to an end. Exactly. Forget down 50%, right? We’re recording this five, six, 7% off the highs and people are talking like it’s the end of the world. Let, let’s talk about another one of your quotes that kind of caught my eye, which was discussing the great normalization. What, what is the great normalization? 00:33:45 [Speaker Changed] So, you know, we’ve been trying to remind clients how extraordinary in financial history the past 15 years have been since the great financial crisis. We’ve had an unprecedented level of Federal reserve involvement. We’ve had markets that have been buttressed by the Federal Reserve balance sheet that have been buttressed by a disproportionate amount of time having financial repression or low rates, rates being held down. We’ve had gone through the, the Covid crisis, which stimulated unprecedented fiscal stimulus as a share of GDP and performance, what clients have actually experienced, if you go back to March of 2009, right? And you, and I remember March of 2009, the bottom, we were probably looking at an s and p 500 that was trading in the mid 606 6 6. 00:34:49 [Speaker Changed] I remember the devil’s bottom. The devil’s 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely devil’s bottom. And look at where we are now even though we’re off, we’re still up during that time. Nine x right. Nine x over 15 years. So I tell people what, let’s put this in perspective, what that kind of mathematically translates to as we’ve, for 15 years, we’ve compounded at about 15% per year. So that’s two times normal for a business cycle. Let’s call it a, you know, where we had two very short recessions, two back to back, very long business cycles, not normal. Right. What was also not normal is during that time, the degree to which US exceptionalism and the US outperformed the rest of the world. I mean, we were outperforming every year, year in year out by 600, 700 basis points per year. And so when we, you know, kind of came into January of 2025, we were starting to talk to folks about, look at where the dollar is versus virtually every other currency super strong. 00:35:56 Look at the share of US equities versus the rest of the world. We’re 10% of the world’s population were 25% of the world’s GDP or 33% of, of global corporate profits. But we were 67% of all stock market cap. Just extreme. And so what we were starting to talk to clients about is, look, this is an extraordinary amount of large s and a lot of it has come from fed accommodation from stimulus. Now we’re on the other side of that. We have a very robust economy. We’ve re levered the economy, if you will, where the leverage of the private sector, the household sector, the corporate sector that got us into the great financial crisis that’s been healed. Right. We have households that can still carry, for the most part they’re interest burdens very, 00:36:52 [Speaker Changed] Very low historically. Right? Right. It’s not the total debt, it’s the debt relative to discretionary income 00:36:58 [Speaker Changed] That matters. Exactly. Exactly. Corporations that still have an extraordinarily relative low locked in cost to capital. And what’s become re levered is the federal balance sheet and the government balance sheet. And now here we are, and every couple of decades we have to go through these periods where there’s heat in the economy and inflation is one manifestation of the heat. Real growth and investment is another manifestation of the heat. But the other manifestation is you probably have overdone it on the stimulus and you gotta pull it back and there’s gonna be some pain. So when we talk about normalization, we say, look, we’re not going back to 2% interest rates. Right. Normal cost of capital in an, in an economy like Americas that has real fundamental growth of 2% and real inflation or experienced inflation of two and a half to three, which is what we’ve had for the last 80 years. 00:37:58 Right? Right. Not 2% target that the Fed says. Right. What that tells you is that long-term rates used to be normal at five to 6%. Right. That’s not crazy. Right. And yet the market continued to sell at a 22 times forward multiple. So what we’ve been saying is part of the great normalization is over the next couple of years, we think long rates start to move towards five to 6%. Like they were in the aughts in the two thousands and in the nineties. Right. And multiples start mean reverting a little bit to 17. And that’s the great normalization your earnings actually start growing into those multiples. 00:38:40 [Speaker Changed] You mentioned the 2% target of the Federal Reserve. Did you work with Roger Ferguson when he was at Merrill? 00:38:47 [Speaker Changed] No, I did not. But 00:38:48 [Speaker Changed] He eventually became vice chairman Yes. Of the Federal Reserve. Yes. And put out this delightful research piece that said the 2% inflation target comes from a New Zealand television show in the 1980s. And it has nothing whatsoever to do with the modern economy. I’m to this day, I delighted by that. And I don’t understand why the Federal Reserve continues to be so locked in on 2%, which we had in the 2010s when Yes. Deflation was the risk. Correct. Correct. Now that we’ve moved from a monetary regime to a fiscal regime, fiscal 00:39:24 [Speaker Changed] Regime, 00:39:25 [Speaker Changed] 3% seems to make more sense. And we’re there, we’re there, I don’t know why they’re stuck on that. I think they’re just afraid of, of making mistake again, part of the normalization that hey, the fed’s a little behind the curve with what’s going on in the rest of the economy. 00:39:43 [Speaker Changed] No, exactly. And and I think one of the things that, that has the market having to adjust is this idea of a data-driven fed. Right. In a world where the fed’s the only headline and the Fed is giving forward guidance, it’s really easy to have low vol and for everyone to just ride momentum. But in a normal world where the Fed has to respond to economic data, you and I know economic data is a manifestation of human behavior. It’s volatile. Right? So the Fed is gonna be more volatile. Policy is going to be more volatile. It means your interest rate curve. Your yield curve needs to have some term premium in it. Remember that. And, and that’s part of the great normalization. I, you know, I, I do do the math when I, when I do some of my, my chats with the younger folks on the, on the team and I say, okay, real growth inflation term premium, you see this thing, it’s been zero or negative for the last 15 years. That’s not normal. 00:40:51 [Speaker Changed] So wait, you’re, you’re saying the 30 year bond should pay a higher yield than the 10 year bond Exactly. 00:40:56 [Speaker Changed] And higher 00:40:56 [Speaker Changed] Than the 00:40:57 [Speaker Changed] Two year. Yes. I’m not familiar with exactly. It’s been 00:41:00 [Speaker Changed] Opposite for so long. 00:41:02 [Speaker Changed] It’s so hard. 00:41:02 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. So, so another quote of yours, which I assume is related to this is the era of set it and forget it is over. Yes. Is that what we’re saying here? 00:41:13 [Speaker Changed] Yes, exactly. So, you know, what comes out of this idea of the great normalization is it’s also an era where we can’t just passively close our eyes, buy the s and p 500 market cap weighted index and go to bed. It was a great 15 year run. But our view is that as cost of capital readjusts as it’s actually a positive number, this is where the skill of corporate management starts to differentiate winners and losers. And we move back to a world, right? And you and I grew up in this world that, that that fun world where you’re actually stock picking, where the research that individual fundamental analysts were doing mattered. And you had to say, Hey, these guys are gonna win. ’cause these management teams are taking strategies that can work and these management teams are dropping the ball. 00:42:09 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really super interesting. Given all of these changes that we’re witnessing, and again, this is something else you’ve written about. How do you separate the signal from the noise? What’s your process for filtering out what’s just na noisy data that’s within the margin of error or, or just slightly beyond and genuine important market information. 00:42:35 [Speaker Changed] So this is the art, right? This is the art of all of it is separating the noise and the signal. For us, the signal is always operates ultimately on just two axes, is what’s really going on in terms of the rate of change in growth and what is going on in terms of the rate of change of inflation. Because the rate of change of inflation is gonna give you an indication of policy bias, of rate bias. And if you can focus on those two things and every single piece of data you get, you say, what does this mean for growth? What does this mean for inflation? You can, you can try to keep yourself sane at night. 00:43:12 [Speaker Changed] Huh. So I’m curious as to, February was a a a tough month. We’ve seen volatility spike now up to 23 or so, I haven’t even looked at it today with markets off a couple of percent. The questions you’re getting from clients, what are you hearing, what are you hearing about tariffs, about the post-election regime change, about what’s going on in geopolitics? What’s lighting your phone up and, and what are you telling these folks? 00:43:43 [Speaker Changed] You know, obviously we would love to spend the bulk of our time talking about asset allocation as it as it corresponds to growth and inflation. Unfortunately. Exactly. To your point, Barry, we’re spending a disproportionate amount of time out of our comfort zone being asked to respond to our understanding and our expectations for the economic impacts of policy. And what has complicated things, as you know, is that this administration has chosen to implement policy fast and furious and in many cases, quote unquote in parallel, right? I I think that, you know, coming off of the election, coming off of the campaign season, a lot of us were trying, you know, to build models based on, well they’re gonna sequence things, right? They’re gonna, you know, deliver some of the bad news early and then, you know, the candy will come at the end. I think what we’re experiencing, especially after the last 15 years of this kind of one or two note market, right? Where it’s been, what is the Fed saying, oh, generative AI looks like good headlines to 17 headlines a day of policy, 00:45:02 [Speaker Changed] Flood the zone, 00:45:02 [Speaker Changed] Flood the zone. So clients are asking for certainty, they’re asking for clarity, and it’s hard, I’m gonna be honest with you. So look, we are in the camp, and this is a pure economic view. I, i, I hope I’m not gonna be accused of, of being political. Pure economists will tell you that tariffs, particularly if implemented over long periods of time, and to the extent that they cause trade war or reciprocity, tend to be destructive to total global trade in aggregate, tend to be a one-time inflationary problem and tend, you know, to, to, to really, you know, kind of hurt the efficiency of markets. And so I think we’re seeing some of that. I think it’s very hard for CEOs and CFOs today to be making decisions, not knowing what the policy duration is gonna be. It’s one thing to have a policy and say, okay, we’re deregulating X or here’s the new tax policy for the next four years. I can work with that. When you tell me we’re having 25% tariffs on lumber, well how long, how much, where, where, how’s it going? You know, I think that’s the big question is, is the inconsistency of it and the questions of, is this a negotiating tactic? What are we negotiating for? How do I model it? That kind of thing. 00:46:30 [Speaker Changed] And you know, it’s really hard to get a handle on this because let’s just look, use Canada and Mexico. The first tariff was floated and then it was quickly resolved and it felt, oh, this is just a negotiating tactic, the effect of the second 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on China. And it’s, it’s not only surprising that it was done, it’s kind of perplexing. What did, what are we getting out of the tariffs with Canada? When you look at some of the supposed basis for this, the fentanyl that comes into the United States is mostly brought in by US citizens and smugglers. It’s not coming in from either Canadian lumber or oil or televisions that are being built in Mexico and sent over the border. It’s, you know, it’s kind of odd, especially given the North American free trade agreement that was negotiated to replace NAFTA was Trump’s treaty. So the whole thing is kind of, you know, clients don’t like to hear you say, I have no idea what’s going on, and be wary of people who say they do. But it really feels like this is sort of arbitrary and capricious and we don’t really know how this resolves. It’s sort of grit your teeth and write it out. Is, is brace yourself moth or that’s what it feels like. Just hold 00:48:09 [Speaker Changed] On. And, and it, the way I always frame things is I say to people, look what kind of risk premiums are there in the markets when stocks are very expensive as they have been for a while here, it tells you risk premiums are tight, right? Things are, quote unquote price for perfection. When credit spreads are tight, it tells you people are not requiring a premium for fear or default or uncertainty, right? When there are no term premiums in the, in the United States Treasury curve, it’s telling you the same thing. So look, if this were all happening against a backdrop where stocks were selling it 15 times where, you know, we had 800, you know, basis points, spreads in high yield, all this kind of stuff, you and I might be saying, Hey guys, yes, there’s uncertainty, but this is a buying opportunity. Look, you know, things are selling off off of a 15 multiple. Where do you think they’re gonna land at 13? We’re gonna buy here, but we’re not there. Markets hate uncertainty and they really hate uncertainty when things are priced for perfection. 00:49:19 [Speaker Changed] Does, does it give you a lot of room for error? So, so let’s talk about something more positive. AI has been the big story for the past couple of years. Let’s talk a little bit about that and other emerging technologies or innovations you think might impact the investing landscape over the next decade. What are you, what are you looking at? 00:49:40 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we’re looking at a, at a lot of things, but look, clearly generative AI is transformative. There’s no doubt about it. I think the conundrum for investors is how do you stay ahead of the revolution itself? And what I mean by that is that, you know, technology innovation tends to, to follow very clear scripts over history. And by that I mean you tend to get the big infrastructure build, then you get the software applications, and then you get mass economy wide deployment. And in that sequence you get new killer apps and, and the quote unquote the winners of that era. I’m not entirely sure that all the winners have been identified with regard to generative ai. And while the magnificent seven are magnificent on many, many, many financial attributes, on many innovation attributes, you know, I I think the market is telling you that maybe they are not the only winners here and that maybe the growth in the infrastructure build doesn’t go on forever. 00:50:56 And certainly our experience with the internet validates that. So, you know, what are we super excited about right now? We’re, we’re super excited about some of these AI adopters. We’re looking at areas, whether it’s document recognition, voice recognition, all these various applications, the agents, you know, how we’re gonna deploy AI into learning agents to, to help human beings do things almost become the white collar robot, if you will. I think, you know, that’s all very interesting. But where AI is likely to have some of its most profound impacts is in healthcare. And the, the extent to which we’re going to be able to use large language models just to process data and personalize medicine and personalized diagnostic and solutions treatment plans so much faster. 00:51:55 [Speaker Changed] I saw a fascinating video the other day about AI being used. So when you look at the history of healthcare, it really started out as a little bit of chemistry and then it became biology and then it became genomics. And one of the challenges is trying to figure out how protein folds and how different molecules interact with the body’s receptors and immune system. And it turned out that, like for the prior 50 years, we’ve identified a few thousand different combinations of molecules and protein foldings, which is key to figuring out what the genetic code operates in, in actual life. And so they went from like the library of 2,500 protein folding protocols to using ai identifying like 400,000. 00:52:51 [Speaker Changed] That’s exactly 00:52:51 [Speaker Changed] Like, it’s an insane order magnitude. And we’ve only begun figuring out how do these different proteins work on different parts of the body in response to different diseases, infections, virus. It’s like, it, it’s shocking that these aren’t headlines yet. Yes. They’re just academic research. Yes. But it seems like when people are talking about longevity, it’s not the cold plunge that’s gonna do 00:53:19 [Speaker Changed] It, right? 00:53:20 [Speaker Changed] It’s gonna be all of these half a million new correct. Protein designs. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about the investment opportunities that exist in the healthcare space. 00:53:29 [Speaker Changed] So right now, you know, healthcare is one of the sectors that we have moved overweight, you know, clearly the healthcare sector over the last, you know, decade and much of this bull market in large part’s been left behind. And valuations have been, you know, with the exception of, of some of the obesity drugs, the pharmaceutical industry has been squashed by, by worries about regulations squashed by the power of the insurance companies, you know, squashed by patent, expire, you know, squashed by a lot, a lot of things. But we think that that valuations are there. We think that that’s a great place to invest and, and you can do it obviously through venture and in the public markets. Other themes that we’re super, super excited about are defense and space and the, and the conjoint between those two. You know, the, this idea that ultimately the way we think about weaponry, the way we think about defense will be human less, not unlike, you know, some of what you see in, in the sci-fi movies and Star Wars, unmanned vehicles doing the, the very surgical games of war, if you will. So I think, you know, that’s something we’re super excited about, some of the innovations in the energy space, not so much purely around clean tech or powering data center, but really thinking about how do we more creatively use and reduce dependency on some of these rare earth materials to create battery autonomous vehicles. Another one. So all of these areas, it’s a very, very fascinating time to be an investor in new tech. 00:55:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You, you mentioned autonomous and defense, this giant New York Times article Yeah. Came out about the war in Ukraine and the transition from World War one and two type trench warfare, armored vehicles, tanks. And exactly 70% of the casualties inflicted in the war as of recently are being driven by drones. Drones. It’s absolutely futuristic sci-fi. Yeah. When warfare changes that rapidly, it has to make you raise the question, how do the geopolitical alignments change? How do the, 00:55:53 [Speaker Changed] Here we are, Barry, here we 00:55:54 [Speaker Changed] Are. How do the tech com how do the big defense companies Yep. Like there’s a reason Palantir has been super hot and not necessarily Lockheed Martin or Boeing Correct. It, it’s really quite fascinating. I I have two personal questions Yes. To ask you before we get to our favorite questions. All right. Starting with you wake up every morning at 5 0 7. Yeah. So first, why 5 0 7? It’s such a specific number as opposed to just setting the alarm for five or five 30. And then if you’re up at 5 0 7, give us a day in the life of Morgan Stanley’s Chief Investment 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] Officer. Oh geez. So I am extraordinarily superstitious about odd numbers. 00:56:39 [Speaker Changed] Really? Yes. 00:56:41 [Speaker Changed] And wait, 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] You were, you were applied mathematics undergraduate. Yep. That doesn’t, 00:56:47 [Speaker Changed] It’s just, it’s scream a superstition I guess. I guess it’s part of my lived experience is that, you know, I always say, say to people, Hey, it’s an odd number year, we’re good. You know, really? Oh my God. I’m very, I’m very, so I’m, 00:57:01 [Speaker Changed] I’m trying to remember the Nobel Laureate in physics, I’m drawing a blank on his name, who a grad student visited his house and there’s a, a horseshoe over the doorway. Yeah. And the grad student says, professor, you don’t, you don’t believe in, in Lucky Charms and things like that. And the response was, maybe it was plank. I, I’m not sure, but the response was, I’m told it works whether you believe in it or not, which is, which is pretty charming. So, so, 00:57:29 [Speaker Changed] But I believe in it. Odd numbers, I do odd five 00:57:32 [Speaker Changed] Seven is really 00:57:33 [Speaker Changed] Specific, so it’s an odd number. So, so look, it was something, you know, back in the day, one of my jobs was, I was a director of research and so I always had to be at my desk right at six 30. So I got into the routine of, you know, up 5 0 7, you know, do the quick 20 minutes on the treadmill, grab the coffee, shower out the door. And so that’s, you know, still, still me, you know, old dogs, new tricks, right? It’s been, it’s been really hard. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] And how different is every day as CIO is like, I like to sometimes ask what’s a day in the life like? But I suspect no two days are the same for you. 00:58:08 [Speaker Changed] No, no. Two days are the same. But, but Barry, let me just tell you, I, I wake up 5 0 7 every day and the very first thing I say is, I am blessed that I have the career that I have, that I have the seat that I have at this point in my life because I am learning every day. No two days are the same. I get to hang out with the most amazing people like you, you know, like my colleagues at Morgan Stanley, like my clients, all of whom are, you know, so, so interesting and successful in different ways. Going to meetings where you get to hear Scott Vasant speak at the New York Economics Club and you know, you’re just really feel alive. You feel plugged into the world and, and what’s going on. So I feel blessed e every day and, and no two days are the same. 00:59:02 [Speaker Changed] So last, last career question. You’ve been watching the state of the economy, the markets, just what’s going on in the world for just about 25, 30 years. What’s been the most significant shift you’ve observed in wealth management over that period? 00:59:22 [Speaker Changed] Wow, that’s a fantastic question. Look, I, I think if there was one theme that I would say over my 30 year career that has characterized everything, it has been the democratization of reasonably sophisticated product, right? So whether, you know, you talk about, you know, first coming into the business and the advent of, you know, first mutual funds was about democratization of, you know, diversified stock investing and then, you know, passive investing as a way to get access to an index in a, you know, more technology efficient way. Or you talk about the original rollout of quote unquote liquid alternatives or evergreen type products. And now we’re at the point where, you know, we’re talking about very sophisticated private equity, private credit products being contemplated for 401k plans, right? And being packaged in, in these structures to give folks periodic liquidity. So democratization of, you know, sophisticated alpha and beta. That, that once upon a time, I think, you know, when I, you know, started in the industry, people would say, well, there’s the market and then there’s the extra stuff and that, and you gotta figure it out. And if you don’t like that, own some bonds. I think now it’s, it’s the, the democratization of very sophisticated access of access to sophisticated products. 01:01:00 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s jump to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests, starting with, what are you streaming these days? What are you watching? To relax? Yeah. Or on the treadmill or just to keep you entertained. 01:01:13 [Speaker Changed] Love streaming. The most recent thing I finished was something called shrinking. So good. Yeah. So Apple TVs, so yeah, so good. I’ve been watching Prime Targets. 01:01:23 [Speaker Changed] What are prime targets? 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] So Prime Target is a show about a mathematician who’s working in Oxford, who is working on a, a thesis to generate prime number combinations and permutations that supposedly if he’s able to develop this algorithm as part of his p PhD thesis would unlock or give folks the ability to hack almost any system. And so of course it becomes a scenario where, you know, there’s the bad guys are chasing him to try to get his, his thing. And of course, you know, the national security agencies are trying, are chasing him, and it’s kind of a spy versus spy kind of thing. And it’s a poor, innocent nerd guy in the middle. 01:02:14 [Speaker Changed] And what is surface or surfacing? 01:02:16 [Speaker Changed] So Surface is a, is a show also on Apple tv. It’s in its second season. It’s about a woman who kind of fakes her death as a way of leaving behind her life and going back to England. She’d been living in the United States she was married to in a marriage that wasn’t great and she fakes her death to go back to England to investigate what she thinks was her mother’s murder. Huh. When she was a kid. 01:02:46 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. Let’s talk about your early mentors who helped shape your career. 01:02:51 [Speaker Changed] Sure. You know, Bernstein was that seminal place. So the two I would, I would speak to one, Lou Sanders. Lou Sanders was the CEO at Sanford Bernstein, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest value investors certainly that I ever met in my career. Just brilliant, A numbers person, very, very high integrity, taught me how to be objective, to get the emotions out of it, to build the model and have the discipline to build the model. Sally Crouch, we talked about one of my best friends in the business. You know, someone that I, I care a lot about, someone who showed me how to lead, although we were peers, she has a natural charisma, natural instinct for leading people. She and I kind of worked side by side through the nine 11 crisis. I learned a lot from her in terms of what people need from leaders when things are tough. They, they look to leaders to say the right things and do the right things and be strong people and not get, you know, bogged into headlines or theories. But just to, to say, remember what we are here to do. 01:04:11 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading 01:04:14 [Speaker Changed] Currently? Ah, what am I reading? So now this is gonna reveal my, my politics. The last book I finished was a book called Prequel by Rachel Maddow. And it’s a very, 01:04:26 [Speaker Changed] My wife is in the middle of reading that. 01:04:27 [Speaker Changed] It’s fantastic. 01:04:28 [Speaker Changed] That’s what she said. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s captivating and it’s fantastic and it’s captivating and fantastic, not for good reasons, but it lays out some of the dynamics of American history and, and American political dynamics between the warts between World War I and World War ii and the first America first movement in the United States. That was very much against America ever getting into World War ii. 01:05:01 [Speaker Changed] Very isolationist, very anti, 01:05:04 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And it was, and it was in this a way that’s similar to our current political dynamic. It ended up bringing in some very different factions, right? Where you had interestingly, coalitions of people who ended up being a political block, who came at things from very different points of view. So you had kind of the father Coghlan part of the movement. Father Coghlan for those who, who know, was a very, very famous Sunday radio show. Catholic preacher and, and 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] Pacifist, correct. 01:05:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. But, but very isolationist. That was one dimension of it. And then you had, you know, kind of the anti-communist and the anti-immigrant sides of the party and, and some other, other dimensions to it. But it’s a fascinating book. Prequel, Rachel Maddow, really recommend it. 01:05:58 [Speaker Changed] Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either wealth management or finance or anything related to your work? 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so, and people hate when, when I say this ’cause it belies the, the path that I took. But I, I am a big believer in liberal arts education. I don’t think that to work on Wall Street to be a great portfolio manager, to be a great, you know, economist, to be a great strategist that you have to study finance or business administration or go to the Wharton School of Business. I do not believe that. I believe we live in a world where if you know how to read books, if you know how to teach yourself things, if you know how to learn how to learn, you can have a phenomenal career. And, and it’s exactly to your point, Barry, that you and I, you know, entered the business 25, 30 years ago. Nothing’s the same. It’s all about adapting. And so if I, I, I tell folks, study what you love. Study what you’re passionate about. Learn how to learn and never lose that hunger for knowledge. 01:07:12 [Speaker Changed] Be become an autodidact. Learn how to learn, learn how to, what’s going on. Our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today that you wish you knew 30 years ago when you were first getting started? And I don’t mean by Amazon at two and Apple at one. I mean, what broad principle did you learn along the way that would’ve been useful to have found out much earlier? 01:07:37 [Speaker Changed] That being right is not what matters. I, 01:07:40 [Speaker Changed] You’re gonna have to expound on that. 01:07:42 [Speaker Changed] Being right is not what matters. What what matters in the long run is what Einstein said, you know, decades ago, remember the power of compounding, if you save, if you’re disciplined, if you just have a consistent plan, you will highly likely compound your wealth at at least 7.5 to 8% per year. Which means you will double your wealth every decade, double your savings, whatever that is. For most of us, if we’re lucky enough, we have, you know, three, four doublings in us. Just do that. And it’s not to say that what I do all day doesn’t matter, or what you do all day doesn’t matter. It’s just at the end of the day, we’re trying to guide people. But as I say to my team, I know the likelihood I’m gonna be right on any given decision is at best 50 50. What matters is do we have a good plan and are we being disciplined and consistent about it? ’cause compounding is your friend. 01:08:50 [Speaker Changed] Really fascinating stuff.

Title: Audit finds Hong Kong company breached Panama Canal ports contract
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/8/audit-finds-hong-kong-company-breached-panama-canal-ports-contract
Time Published: 2025-04-08T12:26:06Z

Report comes as US uses claims of Chinese meddling to push for control over strategic waterway. Auditors in Panama have reported that the Hong Kong-based owner of key Panama Canal ports has violated the terms of its contract. Comptroller-General Anel Flores announced on Monday that the audit had found “many breaches” of the concession awarded to Hong Kong-based logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports, which sit close to the Panama Canal. The report comes as United States President Donald Trump continues his push for control of the strategic waterway, and it has been suggested that its findings and the timing of the announcement may be linked. The auditors concluded that CK Hutchison had failed to pay Panama $1.2bn owed under the contract. Flores said Panama Ports, the subsidiary that operated the facilities, benefitted from many tax exemptions and had been found responsible for irregularities in a previous audit. “This is a very delicate issue,” Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. “There are many violations that will have to be explained,” he added. Panama Ports won the concession to operate Balboa, located near the Pacific end of the Panama Canal, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, in 1997. The contract was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. However, the control of the facilities by a Hong Kong-based company has come under scrutiny since Trump accused China of interfering with the strategic waterway. He has pledged to retake control of the Panama Canal, which the US handed to Panama in 1999, insisting that it is vital for US national security. CK Hutchison agreed earlier this year to sell the ports to US company BlackRock, effectively putting the ports under US control. However, a contract has yet to be finalised, which has been met with anger in Beijing. Flores said the audit results would be sent to Panama’s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports and has the power to terminate the concession contract. That is the main point, some analysts suspect, with the audit designed to allow Panama to strip the Hong Kong company of the contract to appease the Trump administration. “It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession,” Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations at the University of Panama, told the AFP news agency. The release of the audit results came just hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama to meet President Jose Raul Mulino and visit the canal. Flores denied that the release of the report had any connection to the visit. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Teucrium Investment Advisors has launched the first-ever leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to XRP in the United States. The fund, officially titled the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, will begin trading today on NYSE Arca under the ticker XXRP. The ETF is structured to deliver twice the daily return, using synthetic exposure through swap agreements rather than direct spot market purchases. According to the prospectus filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fund will not invest directly in XRP or XRP futures contracts. Instead, it gains exposure through “total return swap agreements” referencing a calculated daily value based on a mix of third-party XRP benchmarks and European-listed exchange-traded products (ETPs). While US-listed spot ETFs remain unavailable, the fund’s swap pricing methodology relies on internationally traded instruments. These include the 21Shares ETP, Bitwise Physical ETP, Virtune ETP, WisdomTree Physical ETP, and CoinShares Physical ETP. Additionally, the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and the CME CF XRP-Dollar Real Time Index are used as part of the valuation framework, ensuring alignment with institutional benchmarks. Teucrium has set a management fee of 1.85%, placing it at the higher end of the cost spectrum among crypto-linked ETFs, a reflection of the fund’s complex structure and reliance on multiple synthetic reference instruments. The SEC’s quiet certification of the fund’s registration and NYSE Arca’s approval of its listing indicate a growing regulatory comfort with derivative-based crypto products, even as spot ETFs remain under review. Teucrium, a CFTC-regulated firm with $311 million in assets under management, is best known for its commodity ETFs, particularly in agricultural markets. It previously broke ground with the Teucrium Bitcoin Futures Fund, one of the first Bitcoin ETFs approved under the Securities Act of 1933. The company is also preparing a bearish counterpart —the Teucrium 2x Short Daily ETF—which would offer leveraged inverse exposure to daily price declines. That product remains in the registration pipeline, according to the firm’s filings. The launch occurs amid heightened momentum for spot altcoin ETFs in the United States. On April 3, the US Senate Banking Committee voted 13 to 11 to advance the nomination of Paul Atkins as the new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently said in an interview he expects multiple ETFs to launch in the US by the second half of 2025. A wave of filings from major asset managers including Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton have hit the SEC, all seeking SEC approval for spot XRP ETFs. The potential for market giants like BlackRock and Fidelity to follow suit has not gone unnoticed. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, remarked that he expects both investment giants to follow suit. At press time, XRP traded at $1.90. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Trump’s Dismantling of Hamilton’s Debt-Based Financial System That Has Bankrupted America Is Now Underway

What is the new tariff regime being implemented by the Trump administration really about? It’s actually a complete reset of the financial system created by Alexander Hamilton 236 years ago consisting of massive permanent government deficits to finance a globalist military empire by borrowing from the rich and taxing the poor. This is what I wrote about two days ago here on the Three Sages substack in an article entitled Trump’s Tariffs: Alexander Hamilton’s catastrophic US financial system comes home to roost. Don’t let all the hot air deceive you. Now, stock market prices worldwide are “crashing.” This is the natural and expected result of the gigantic equity bubble that has been run up by big globalist finance over the last five years since the Biden administration went all-in with BlackRock, etc., and their global counterparts in massive deficit spending for war in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with the high Federal Reserve interest rates that benefit only rich investors. The Trump plan is to rebuild Main Street. While he is raising tariffs, he is also pressuring the Fed to cut rates. So the big investors are in a panic. And because Wall Street has been able to deceive working people into putting their retirement savings into the stock market, they are trying to get everyone else to panic too as yet another of their mighty bubbles bursts. But for Trump to succeed, several steps are needed besides lower interest rates. One is the promised tax cuts, especially the cuts on tips, overtime, and Social Security that will help those who need more cash in their pockets right now. Another is continued reductions of gas and grocery prices. But another is to follow through on making peace with Russia over Ukraine and with Iran in the Middle East. It’s long past time for Israel to back off. These wars have to stop now, and the big weapons manufacturers who cheer-lead these wars have to rejoin civil society. Plus the entire Federal Reserve System should be replaced by a new program of indigenous currency as laid out by Dennis Kucinich in his proposed NEED Act of 2011 that I have written about in this space before. But there is yet another factor that is always overlooked. This is the fact that a modern industrial society never pays in salaries and wages the money needed to purchase what industry is able to produce. The fact that there is always a “gap” between societal income and national earnings was explained over a century ago by British engineer C.H. Douglas in his book Economic Democracy. I also explain it in my own book, We Hold These Truths: The Hope of Monetary Reform. In order to fill the gap, which is a result of retained earnings for investment and innovation, the government has to issue citizen dividends in the form of regular stipends similar to what we see today with the Alaska Permanent Fund. This is the correct way to balance the books and assure that ordinary working people can survive. This is what Trump now must implement—an American Dividend for equal sharing of the bounty of a real productive economy. I’ll be writing more about this in the weeks ahead. In the meantime, the best source for solid information on the new economic regime continues to be Jeff Childers in his daily C&C column including this one from today: ☕️ TRUMP SNEEZED ☙ Monday, April 7, 2025 ☙ C&C NEWS 🦠 Global crash, Trump tariffs bite; 25% of Earth seeks deals; China reels, EU buckles; UK flips; inflation, oil down; Main Street cheers; was a market reset the plan all along? And much more. One last thing on Hamilton’s ruinous financial program is to remember what John Adams, second president of the US said about it. According to Ron Chernow, author of a recent biography of Hamilton: “[Adams] detested banks and believed that Hamilton’s system would ‘swindle’ the poor and release the ‘gangrene of avarice’ into the American atmosphere.” (Alexander Hamilton, p.531) Adams was exactly right. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: How Michael Dorrell Became A Billionaire Making Private Infrastructure A Safe Haven
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/04/08/how-michael-dorrell-became-a-billionaire-making-private-infrastructure-a-safe-haven/

ByHank Tucker ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. In 2001, Michael Dorrell volunteered to move from the Sydney headquarters of Australian investment bank Macquarie to a backwater in its infrastructure investing specialty: the United States of America. “For many years, Macquarie didn’t take the U.S. all that seriously. That’s why a 25-year-old kid could be sent over here and be one of six people looking at this whole market,” explains Dorrell, now 51. “We had the market to ourselves.” The U.S., with its now $4 trillion tax exempt municipal bond market, is still a comparative laggard when it comes to private financing of infrastructure. But between a growing list of profitable niches (think private plane airports and data centers serving the artificial intelligence boom) and growing demand for low-risk alternative investments, it has turned into a bonanza for Dorrell. In 2011, he cofounded New York City-based infrastructure investment firm Stonepeak, and still runs it as CEO. Today, it manages $72 billion in an infrastructure portfolio including wind farms, broadband service and fiber providers, marine shipping equipment, and builders of data centers–with around 55% of those assets in the U.S. Aleksandr Karnyukhin for Forbes Forbes estimates Dorrell is now worth $8.5 billion, with most of that his controlling stake in Stonepeak. In 2023, private capital heavyweight Blue Owl Capital spent $2 billion for a minority stake in Stonepeak in a deal that valued the firm at $15 billion, according to a source. It was the largest investment Blue Owl has made for a stake among the dozens of private investment firms it has partnered with. “There are a million mid-market buyout firms and around 200 large-cap buyout firms. In infrastructure, there are six to 10 major players, so it's a much smaller pool,” says Blue Owl co-president Michael Rees. “Infrastructure is an area where there's a benefit to scale, and returns are actually more attractive at the larger end of the market. You can solve more problems, and the deals tend to be bigger.” Now Stonepeak is raising another infrastructure fund, aiming for a $15 billion fund size and a 12% net annual internal rate of return over the fund’s 12-year life, according to a presentation released by Rhode Island’s state worker pension fund last year. That’s not unrealistic–the presentation showed that Stonepeak’s average net IRR across its four flagship funds is 12.4%. Even more impressive: It hasn’t realized a single loss on 46 investments to date. That downside protection is crucial to the pension funds and insurance companies among its limited partners. Dorrell portrays infrastructure as a blend of private credit and equity, with some assets behaving like long-term bonds, while others have more variable cash flows. While U.S. public markets sink into correction territory and typical buyout funds slump, institutional investors are seeking more stability in private credit and infrastructure. “If you're doing a private equity deal, your base case might be a 25% return, but your downside case may be you only get 30 cents on the dollar back,” says Dorrell. “For us in the downside cases, we get 100 cents on the dollar back, maybe even more than 100 cents on the dollar, but our base case might be a 15 (% return), not a 25.” Goldman Sachs projects private infrastructure assets under management worldwide will triple to $3 trillion by 2035, and the Trump Administration's move to cut back on government infrastructure funding could boost interest in privatization in the U.S. There’s even a chance that a Congress looking for revenue sources to offset the cost of Trump’s tax cuts could limit the tax exempt benefits of bonds. That municipal bond market is crucial. In Australia, a severe recession in the early 1990s prompted states to start selling off assets like toll roads and airports. But in the U.S., governmental authorities, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are able to sell tax-exempt bonds secured by future revenues—so even when New York City teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the 1970s, LaGuardia and JFK Airport weren’t sold off. That’s why when Dorrell arrived in the U.S., the area was mostly ignored by Wall Street. Still, Dorrell’s team did identify some attractive U.S. assets, buying up private airport terminals, energy suppliers and electric grids not owned by municipalities. Later, in the mid-2000s, major U.S. investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley launched similar divisions. Dorrell joined Macquarie’s mergers and acquisitions group in 1998 straight out of the University of New South Wales, but noticed much of his desk’s transaction flow came from advising Macquarie’s own funds buying infrastructure assets. After three years of that, with an itch to go abroad, he raised his hand to move to New York. One of Macquarie’s early U.S. deals was its $238 million acquisition in 2004 of Atlantic Aviation, which owns fixed-based operator (FBO) terminals, or airport terminals for private jets. If big, international airports weren’t for sale, this was the next-best thing, and it was underappreciated—Dorrell says they bought it for six times cash flow, while today similar assets would go for 15 to 20 times cash flow. He was instrumental in rolling up a slew of FBOs and adding runways and upgrading the terminals. Today, Atlantic Aviation operates more than 100 such terminals. “You charge landing fees and service fees, and if demand keeps rising, your business is going to get better,” says Murray Bleach, the former CEO of Macquarie North America and Dorrell’s boss at the time. “That’s a traditional infrastructure business—you can predict the income flows for a long time.” Macquarie sold Atlantic Aviation to KKR in 2021 for $4.5 billion, nearly 20 times its purchase price. By then, Dorrell had long since moved on. After a decade at Macquarie, he and colleague Trent Vichie wanted to start their own fund, and after a lunch with Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman decided to partner with the private equity giant. That was in October 2008. Rotten timing. Blackstone’s stock fell by more than 50% before the end of that year—bad news for Dorrell, who received $3 million in stock on his start date to cover the portion of his Macquarie bonus he had to return. His two and a half years at Blackstone were an unsuccessful slog through the crisis, and in 2011, Blackstone let him and Vichie spin out the business and start over. About that time, Dorrell was biking up Mont Ventoux in the French Alps, where the top of the mountain has been deforested and looks like a moonscape. He hit on Stonepeak as a fitting name. One of its first deals was a $175 million equity investment to support the construction of San Diego’s Carlsbad Desalination Plant, sourced through Dorrell’s longtime relationship with Poseidon Resources, the project’s developer. A 30-year water purchase agreement with the San Diego County Water Authority to provide around 10% of the county’s drinking water ensured a baseline of attractive returns. The plant was up and running in 2015. “They bought their water from the Metropolitan Water Association in the north and also the Colorado River, which often ran dry… it’s a win-win, because they’ve solved their challenge,” says Luke Taylor, who was promoted to co-president of Stonepeak along with Jack Howell last year. (Vichie left Stonepeak in 2020 and founded EverWind, a green energy development business in Canada.) In 2019, Stonepeak sold its interest in the Carlsbad project to Aberdeen Standard Investments, generating an annualized return more than double its target 12% return. Stonepeak was also early into “digital infrastructure,” buying a majority stake in Cologix in 2017 with co-investors for $1.2 billion. In 2022, it raised another $3 billion from both new and existing investors to recapitalize the business and buy out some earlier investors. Based in Denver, Cologix is the largest private carrier “hotel” business in the U.S.—carrier hotels serve as hubs for interconnection, for example connecting your home broadband provider to a data center owned by Amazon. Now, artificial intelligence firms are hungry for hyperscale data centers, which have the ability to scale up as demand increases. It’s a field Stonepeak is entering selectively, and only when it has long-term contracts in hand to ensure a return on investment, Howell explains. Cologix has formed a hyperscale division called Scalelogix which has seven current or planned data centers in locations like Ashburn, Virginia, and Columbus, Ohio. “There are two ways to get into hyperscales if you're not already in that game. One way is you go and buy a big existing hyperscale platform… The negative of doing it that way is that you're paying a very big premium,” says Dorrell. “The other way to do it, which we prefer, is to build your own data centers from scratch. It’s probably going to take you five years to get that flywheel going, but the benefit of that is you got into it so much more cheaply.” The U.S. market looks a lot different than when Dorrell got here more than two decades ago. American investors, who once dismissed infrastructure as government work, now can’t get enough of it. Private equity giants KKR, Brookfield and EQT have all raised infrastructure funds, while Blackrock bought Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion last year. “There’s no shortage of opportunity. There’s also no shortage of capital chasing those opportunities,” says Dorrell.

Title: TikTok deal derailed as China pushes back on Trump tariffs

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. US President Donald Trump delayed enforcement of the TikTok sale-or-ban order for 75 additional days last Friday, one day before it was set to take effect. The extension follows Trump’s earlier tariff announcement that reportedly disrupted a pending deal to transfer the app’s US operations to American owners. ByteDance later claimed on Weibo that the company is still in talks with the US government and has not yet reached any agreement. Why it matters: The delay highlights the ongoing uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future in the US and the broader geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has linked the deal with tariff negotiations, adding a new layer of complexity and making clear this is not a simple tech transaction but a bargaining chip in US-China trade relations. Details: Trump announced the delay on his social platform, Truth Social, stating that his administration has been working hard to secure an agreement to “save TikTok” and has “made significant progress,” but the TikTok deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed.” The delay will allow TikTok to operate for another 75 days, pushing its deadline for a sale or closure in the US to mid-June. Context: Last year, former US President Joe Biden enacted a law that forced ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company based in China, to sell its stake in the app or face a ban in the US over national security concerns. The law was scheduled to take effect in January, but Trump announced a delay in its enforcement, hoping to negotiate a deal to keep the app operational. Since then, Trump has stated that numerous buyers have shown “great interest” in acquiring TikTok. TikTok has tried several approaches to resolve the stand-off over US national security concerns, including establishing a Transparency Center, creating a dedicated US data security company, USDS, to manage American user data, and implementing two projects – “Clover” for data segregation and “Texas” for data security – each costing about $1 billion annually. The company has also hired executives with American backgrounds and reached an agreement with Oracle, which will serve as TikTok’s “trusted technology provider” in the US, according to the agreement, and whereby Oracle is authorized to conduct security reviews of TikTok’s US source code. ByteDance has repeatedly stressed that its data storage is localized, with US user data managed by Oracle, and that there is no evidence of security risks, though this defense has gained little traction among US politicians.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs see sharp $103 million outflow as market reacts to US-China war

Unwavering risk-off sentiment sent Bitcoin ETFs spiralling with no inflows in sight. On April 7, total spot Bitcoin ETF outflows reached $103.9 million, with no funds reporting inflows. Ark (ARKB) saw a $4.7 million outflow, Invesco (BTCO) shed $12.9 million, Valkyrie (HODL) and WTree (BTCW) each lost around $6 million, and Grayscale’s GBTC led with a $74 million outflow. Meanwhile, BlackRock (IBIT), Fidelity (FBTC), Bitwise (BITB), Franklin (EZBC), and Grayscale’s other Bitcoin ETFs showed no changes. By comparison, April 4 recorded $64.9 million in ETF outflows, primarily from Bitwise, Ark, and WisdomTree. Over the past week, only April 2 saw positive inflows at $218.7 million, driven by Fidelity, Bitwise, and Ark, indicating periods of stronger buying interest amid otherwise frequent net outflows. These Bitcoin ETF flows come as the crypto market contends with ongoing trade tensions. Bitcoin experienced significant volatility on Monday, triggering $1 billion in liquidations. The entire crypto market went red after concerns about US trade relations with China. A false report on CNBC based on unconfirmed data from X that the Trump administration was planning a 90-day tariff pause caused a brief rally, pushing Bitcoin past $80,000. However, BTC quickly corrected to $77,000. The broader market saw even higher losses. Within minutes, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) shed nearly $10 and wiped out approximately $2 trillion in value from the broader index. Spot Bitcoin ETFs weren’t immune to this volatility, and the overwhelming risk-off sentiment led to $103.9 million in outflows. If volatility continues into the week, we can expect to see even higher outflows as institutions and professional investors adjust their positions.

Title: Banks and FinTechs Navigate Market Mayhem Amid Escalating Tariff Fears

Highlights Trump's recent tariff announcements have intensified recession fears, shaking investor confidence in banking and FinTech sectors. Despite steep year-to-date declines, fintechs like Affirm, PayPal, and Block staged notable rebounds, hinting at investor optimism amid uncertainty. Volatile markets and economic anxieties have stalled FinTech IPOs, with high-profile companies Klarna and Chime postponing their public listings. As the economy continues to reel from President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, speculation about their impact on the banking and FinTech sectors has reached a fever pitch. The once-promising but cautious outlook for the U.S. economy is now being derailed by growing recession fears, casting a shadow over the entire financial services industry, including the FinTech sector. The stock market has been a clear indicator of the turmoil. FinTech stocks, particularly those in the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) space, have faced significant challenges since the tariffs were announced but staged a rally late Monday (April 7). Affirm’s stock has dropped by 44% year-to-date, although its $32 close on Friday rebounded to $38 by the time the market closed Monday. Other FinTechs showed a similar pattern of rebounding on Monday, indicating that investors saw utility in their business models during what many economists are calling a recession waiting to happen, if it hasn’t happened already. Still other major FinTech stocks defied the market’s 300-point drop, with PayPal rising from $56 to $58.37 and Block opening at $46 and rising to $50.47. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that many business leaders believe the U.S. economy is already in a significant downturn. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York, according to CNBC. “One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already.” Where do FinTechs fit in the larger picture? Analysts remain cautious about FinTech growth prospects, citing economic uncertainty and regulatory pressures. Despite this, there is optimism about the sector’s long-term potential, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as a robust employment market and receding inflation. However, that outlook is clouded by the current economic turmoil. The FinTech IPO market has also been affected, with Klarna recently putting its public listing on ice, signaling a chill in FinTech IPOs. Chime also postponed its IPO. Analysts suggest that the volatile market conditions and fears of a global recession are deterring companies from going public, as investors become more risk-averse. As IPOX CEO Josef Schuster noted: “Even with the improved market sentiment we’ve seen, investors are going to continue scrutinizing deals carefully.” Banking stocks were also hit hard as the sector grappled with the broader market downturn. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index experienced significant volatility, reflecting concerns about the economic impact of tariffs and potential recession risks. Major banks like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have seen their shares decline substantially, with Bank of America’s stock dropping 21.8% year-to-date. Regional banks, in particular, are feeling the pain. As Bloomberg reported on Monday, the KBW Regional Banking Index slumped 13% following the tariff announcements, with banks like Western Alliance Bancorp and East West Bancorp experiencing double-digit losses. These institutions are not directly impacted by tariffs but are vulnerable to economic slowdowns, which can reduce loan growth, lower fee income and increase credit costs. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, highlighted the challenges facing the banking sector in his annual shareholder letter. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote. He noted that the economy was already weakening before the recent tariff announcement, adding that these policies are “one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” The impact of tariffs extends beyond the financial sector, affecting consumers and businesses alike. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence reveals that Americans’ financial confidence had already been shaken even before the latest tariff announcement. Most consumers are reducing spending, either by buying fewer things or opting for cheaper products. This pullback is linked to concerns about persistent inflation and a possible recession, even before the full impact of these policies has been felt. In the business world, uncertainty is also prevalent.

Making Money host Charles Payne discusses Wall Streets interpretation of President Donald Trumps tariffs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the stock market could see declines deepen by another 20% amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday. Tariffs are expected to make a wide variety of products more expensive, exacerbating inflationary pressures that have been persistent in recent months. Despite turmoil in the market, Fink said that weakness does create a buying opportunity over the long run despite the potential for further declines. "I would say in the long run, this is more of a buying opportunity than it is a selling opportunity. That doesn't mean we can't fall another 20% from here, too," Fink said. BLACKROCK CEO FINK'S LETTER TO INVESTORS DUMPS DEI, TOUTS EXPANSION OF MARKET ACCESS BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said CEOs he talks to think the U.S. has already entered a recession. (Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) "The economy is weakening as we speak," Fink said, adding that he sees the economy slowing further in the coming months with inflation likely to be elevated. Given his concerns about inflation, Fink said he sees no chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates four or five times this year due to the outlook for inflation, which could be made more challenging as tariffs take effect and foreign governments retaliate. Trump's tariff announcement on April 2 caused markets to plunge in the ensuing days, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all down more than 9% in the past five trading days and more than 10% over the last month.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images / Getty Images) Fink also discussed BlackRock's bid to buy a pair of ports at the Panama Canal along with dozens of other global ports from Hong Kong-based firm CK Hutchison. He said the deal faces nine more months of regulatory review from the Chinese government, which has been critical of the transaction, which would see BlackRock acquire the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at the Panama Canal plus 43 ports in 23 other countries.

Title: Hydrocarbons: Signals of further investment interest in the Greek market

The planet will need investments in natural gas and oil in the coming period to fill the large gaps left behind by the commitment to green development, which led to disinvestment in fossil fuels and a contraction in production. This message was conveyed by Fatih Birol, Director-General of the International Energy Agency, at the CERA Week global exhibition a few weeks ago in Houston, saying that these investments are necessary to address the major shortages observed in the market, which may even cause supply problems. In this international environment of a return to fossil fuel investments, Greece is also seeking to utilize its national energy resources and claim its energy autonomy. The interest of two international giants has already been registered, which aims to proceed with increased pace in the next phase of planning for the extractions, with EDEYEP‘s estimates indicating that the country may attract interest from other investors as well. The state-owned hydrocarbon and energy resources research company recently granted Exxon Mobil a new one-year extension for exploration west of Crete, while yesterday the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources signed the ministerial decision accepting Chevron‘s interest submitted for the South of Crete 1 and South of Crete 2 offshore blocks. It should be noted that Chevron has invested over 5 million euros to purchase all the data (geological and geophysical data) that are in areas that have not been licensed and do not have commercial restrictions. This data becomes accessible to anyone who wants to buy and study it, which is what the American company did to make the decision to invest in our country. In fact, Greece is taking advantage of the international trend brought by Trump‘s re-election to the White House, which wants the revival of investment interest in hydrocarbons. Greece has made it clear that its interest is focused on natural gas, but it could not turn a blind eye to oil either if interesting deposits emerge during the research, according to competent sources who are in a position to know the priorities and the next steps. “It is difficult to say that we have forgotten about oil. What we can say is that we are focusing on natural gas because these investments have a long-term perspective,” say competent sources. And they add that this is also related to quantities. “It would be difficult to tell investors who have spent huge sums on exploration that they cannot get their investments back. It is something we do not consider very likely without closing the door,” the same sources report, estimating that there could be further investment interest in the Greek market. It is worth noting, however, that another large multinational oil and gas company, the Asian Petronas from Malaysia, had been interested in Greece in the past, which had even passed all the technical checks in the country to proceed, something that was ultimately overturned by the change in its strategy. Today, market executives confirm the international investment interest in fossil fuels and cite Blackrock as an example, which recently declared that it is determined to invest in the sector. With the acceptance of Chevron’s interest, the next step is for Greece to determine the exact coordinates of the area, the type of contract and the announcement of an international tender which, based on what the institutional framework provides, will remain open for 90 days so that it can attract other investment interest, if any.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:Stock Market What happens on Wall Street, the heart of the US financial markets, has real impacts for so-called Main Street America. (f-l-e-x: www.flickr.com) Financial markets are often skittish, swinging between extreme optimism and outright panic — a phenomenon we've witnessed in dramatic fashion in the past few weeks. In fact, there are a couple of old adages that brilliantly describe market behaviour. The first is that stock market gains are built upon a wall of worry. And the other is that stocks go up by the stairs and down by the fireman's pole. That second one explains why you only ever hear of "billions wiped off markets" and not the billions slowly wiped on. So, should we pay any notice at all to the shenanigans that routinely rock and roil our world? The short answer is yes. That's primarily because the arcane world of stocks, bonds, currencies and derivatives trading — while generally unfathomable to most of us — can have profound real-world effects. What's more, those effects now have a much quicker transmission process into our everyday lives than they once did. Donald Trump and key advisers such as Peter Navarro have been trying to draw a distinction between what they call Wall Street and Main Street. The message is that there's no need to worry, everything will work out just fine in the end, and that the current meltdown is just wealthy traders chucking a tantrum. Here's what Ed Yardeni, one of Wall Street's most prominent analysts, had to say about that: "On Saturday morning, I nearly gagged on my bagel listening to a CNN interview with Peter Navarro. "The president's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing declared that the tariffs are aimed at benefiting Main Street, not Wall Street. "Other senior officials in the Trump administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have said the same." He went on. "I have news for them: Wall Street is Main Street. Yardeni's last point is extremely important. Gone are the days when ordinary people simply stashed their cash in a bank account. Back in the 1960s and 70s, you could get decent returns with absolutely no risk. But as interest rates have fallen, more people have taken to the stock market, either buying shares directly in companies through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or through investment vehicles. Around half of Australians' superannuation balances are invested in global and local stocks, meaning the tariff-induced market ructions are hitting super savings. Here's why experts say it's not time to panic. According to the most recent survey by the Australian Securities Exchange, 51 per cent of Australians have direct exposure to the stock market. Given the difficulties many younger Australians have in buying a house, a growing number have opted to put their savings into stocks. And then there's superannuation — our retirement funds overwhelmingly reach into the high-octane world of stocks. Australia's superannuation savings have grown to $4.2 trillion. And between them, our big super funds own about a quarter of everything listed on the ASX. When markets move, we notice. There's a phenomenon economists call the "wealth effect" — when we feel wealthy, we spend. When things turn ugly, we snap the wallets shut. It's a rule that applies even if there is no material change in the amount of cash in our pockets. It's become so entrenched, even the Reserve Bank of Australia factors it into its forecasts and its interest rate decisions. The new US tariffs have wreaked havoc on global markets but there could be a silver lining for Australian homeowners, with the big four banks changing their bets on when the RBA could deliver the next rate cut. What would make you feel wealthy? When you're paying off a house and the value of it suddenly surges — as we've witnessed during the past 30 years — home owners tend to be more relaxed about spending, even if on credit. If things turn sour, and real estate prices drop, a large number of households may become worried that the value of their home is worth only barely more than their mortgage. In those circumstances, they're more likely to pull their heads in when it comes to spending. The same goes for the stock market. If it's booming and you own stocks, you'll feel richer and start to spend, even if you don't sell any shares. Consumer spending is the biggest component of our gross domestic product (GDP). When people spend, companies earn bigger profits and are more likely to hire extra workers. But if markets crash, there's a noticeable drop in spending as investors concentrate more on trying to rebuild their lost wealth. And that's when things can turn ugly. The current market sell-offs similarities to the global financial crisis are uncanny and unnerving. Lower spending, businesses going broke, workers being laid off — if the trend becomes entrenched, we end up in recession. And that's one of the big concerns right now, that the violent market shake-out could shatter consumer confidence and result in less spending. Of course, that's on top of the brutal impact of the tariffs themselves. Tariffs ultimately are paid by the businesses and consumers of the country imposing them, meaning prices rise. Those higher prices ordinarily would mean consumers buy less, which would result in an economic slowdown, possibly even a recession. Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, one of the world's biggest investment institutions, expressed those fears on Monday. "When you see a 20 per cent market decline in three days, obviously it has significant impacts and the ripple effects of the potential of tariffs is going to be longstanding," he said.

Title: Contract for Hong Kong company to operate Panama Canal ports had irregularities, audit finds

Panama’s comptroller authority says an audit found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal and it would request an investigation into the authorization of the contract to a Hong Kong company PANAMA CITY -- Panama’s comptroller authority said Monday an audit found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal and it would request an investigation into the authorization of the contract to a Hong Kong company. Comptroller-General Anel Flores said the audit found some payment defaults, accounting miscalculations and some “shadow” operation of companies that the Hong Kong company originally denied, causing Panama around $300 million in lost revenue. The release of the audit of Panama Ports Company, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate subsidiary that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration alleges Chinese interference in the canal's operations, which Panamanian authorities have denied. It also happens the same day the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives to the Central American country to participate in a subregional security conference. “There are many violations that will have to be explained,” the Panamanian comptroller said. He added that the audit’s results will be sent to Panama’s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports and has the power to terminate a contract. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings conglomerate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Panama Ports Company won a concession in 1997 to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. Trump has threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians more than two decades ago. Some days ago, while the audit was underway, CK Hutchison said it has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’ operations of the ports did not mean a Chinese control over the canal. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Bitcoin Whipsaws On Fake Tariff Bombshell News

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Speculation over a purported White House plan to pause tariffs for ninety days on all countries except China sent markets into a frenzy earlier today, triggering abrupt price reversals across equities, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In a quick-fire series of conflicting updates, the rumor initially floated at around 10:10 AM ET, sparked momentum in risk assets, and was eventually deemed “fake news” by the White House. The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) described the chronology on X, noting: “What just happened? At 10:10 AM ET, rumors emerged that the White House was considering a ‘90-day tariff pause.’ At 10:15 AM ET, CNBC reported that Trump is considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for ALL countries except for China. By 10:18 AM ET, the S&P 500 had added over +$3 TRILLION in market cap from its low.” However, only seven minutes later, at 10:25 AM ET, reports emerged that the White House was ‘unaware’ of Trump considering a 90-day pause. “At 10:26 AM ET, CNBC reports that the 90-day tariff pause headlines were incorrect. At 10:34 AM ET, the White House officially called the tariff pause headlines ‘fake news.’ By 10:40 AM ET, the S&P 500 erased -$2.5 TRILLION of market cap from its high, 22 minutes prior. Never in history have we seen something like this,” The Kobeissi Letter writes. The mere suggestion of a temporary reprieve from tariffs managed to shift sentiment rapidly in both equity and crypto markets. BTC, which was trading around $75,805 at the time, soared by roughly 7.2% to surpass $81,200 within half an hour. Once confirmation arrived that no such pause was planned, the gains evaporated almost as fast as they had arrived, pulling Bitcoin back to roughly $77,560. The abrupt turn of events unleashed a wave of commentary among crypto observers. Pentoshi (@Pentosh1) remarked that “The fake news tweet showed there’s a lot of sidelined capital at least for relief rally and the risk is to the upside on any positive news at least temporarily.” Will Clemente III cautioned: “Bear take: Liquidity is bad and this volatility might break something. Bull take: This headline was the cointelegraph intern BTC ETF headline but for equities.” Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, remarked that “Bitcoin’s current price drawdown is about to become the largest of the current cycle,” illustrating his point with a chart that showed BTC’s correction reaching -26.62%, matching the scale of August 2024’s correction. Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) invoked BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s observation that another 20% market drop is not out of the question, saying: “That’s the thing. Under normal circumstances, probability of such scenarios or things such as stagflation are so low you can just brush them off. Trump opened up the left tail => anything is possible. We are one headline away from a 7% candle in either direction.” Podcast host Felix Jauvin (@fejau_inc) agrees: “What’s so crazy about this crash vs other is its entirely self-willed and could be reversed in an instant on one tweet. Has there ever been anything like that?” In the midst of the turmoil, European Union Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed a willingness to seek solutions, stating, “Europe is ready to negotiate with the US,” including the possibility of zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods.
