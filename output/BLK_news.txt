The cryptocurrency sector remains weak as bearish sentiments prevail. Indeed, recent price drops, muted trading activities, and worries about short-term recoveries have seen many investors adopt a defensive bias. Exchange-traded funds flow data reflects this uncertainty, with Bitcoin recording massive withdrawals as altcoin products hold steady. Let us find out more. BTC spot ETFs had a rough session on Monday, with net outflows totaling $151 million, according to SoSoValue. That signals deteriorated interest in these financial products, which have played a key role in institutional crypto adoption. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out as it posted positive ETF flows of $15.49 million on Monday amidst the broader retreat. On the other hand, BlackRock has struggled lately, with iShares’ outflows surpassing $2.2 billion so far in November. Meanwhile, the mixed ETF outflows come as the Bitcoin price experiences notable downward pressure. The bellwether crypto is trading at $88,190, down from late last month’s high above $115,500. While investors remain more conservative about Bitcoin, Ethereum thrived. Data shows Ether ETFs attracted $96.67 million in inflows yesterday, with BlackRock’s ETHA dominating at $92.61 million. Ethereum seems to thrive as Bitcoin struggles, as narratives like the latest attacks on Strategy by JPMorgan magnified uncertainty in BTC-based financial products. Institutions are seemingly migrating to Ethereum, possibly indicating renewed trust in its unique role in powering scaling solutions, decentralized apps (dApps), and support for new infrastructure. ETH is changing hands at $2,925 after gaining 3% the past 24 hours. It lost more than 2% the past week. Solana held its ground, attracting net inflows of $57.99 million on November 24. The altcoin has seen positive ETF flows since its debut, highlighting steady institutional demand. For instance, Bitwise’s Solana spot exchange-traded fund surpassed $500 million AUM last week. Solana experienced amplified institutional interest due to its robust network that prioritizes scalability, speed, and security. The team spent the past years rewriting Solana’s reputation, darkened by previous network outages. Now, the blockchain exhibits a thriving developer community, booming app usage, and Solana-based tokens. With these factors, Solana has carved a unique lane in the blockchain industry. SOL is trading at $138 after soaring 5% in the last 24 hours. The altcoin lost nearly 30% of its value over the past month. Meanwhile, Solana inflow confirms investors looking beyond price performance while prioritizing long-term potential. Meanwhile, the latest ETF flow statistics highlight a split market. Investors are now exploring crypto offerings beyond Bitcoin. Institutional investors are no longer treating all cryptocurrencies the same. They’re now evaluating every project based on solid catalysts, narratives, and momentum.

Title: What happened to crypto market today – Mild recovery, but where is smart money?

Rebound on bid support, smart money still on the sidelines. Despite a mild rebound, extreme fear shows that broader capital hasn’t entered the crypto market today, keeping smart money cautious. Bullish signs like rising whale holdings and institutional interest in DOGE/XRP ETFs indicate the market still has upside potential. The crypto market today registered a mild rebound. Bitcoin [BTC] retested $88,000, sparking debate over whether it has bottomed or if selling pressure is still weighing on the market. Ethereum [ETH] followed, climbing back above $2,800. All in all, has the market turned bullish? On the macro side, nearly $50 billion flowed into the crypto market over the last 24 hours. Notably, $30 billion of that went straight into Bitcoin. That’s 60% of inflows, a sign that traders are still favoring BTC over altcoins, keeping this cycle BTC-led. The result? The Altcoin Season Index slipped by 3 points to 39. In short, the minor rebound of the crypto market today isn’t broad-based. The inflows seemed to be too concentrated, making it premature to call a market bottom yet, with the TOTAL index already down 0.38% intraday. Source: TradingView (TOTAL/USDT) Simply put, the overall market participation has been cautious. BlackRock, for example, has been selling aggressively, moving 2,822 BTC and 36k ETH into Coinbase Prime. On the ETF side, inflows for both BTC and ETH have been flat, showing that big money isn’t jumping in yet. Reinforcing this, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up just 2 points to 12. However, it’s still in “extreme” fear, matching market positioning, with 95% of 24-hour liquidations in the crypto market today coming from longs. Despite bearish signals though, the crypto market today did see some signs of optimism. On the institutional front, Grayscale’s Dogecoin [DOGE] and Ripple [XRP] ETFs grabbed attention, reinforcing confidence in digital assets. Backing this trend, a prominent analyst challenged the idea of a market top. For one, 560k BTC flowed off CEXs, pushing reserves to an eight-year low. Meanwhile, whales holding over 10k BTC hit a five-month high – A sign that even in a risk-off environment, buying pressure didn’t quite disappear. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In short, the crypto market today jumped on bid support. Alas, with institutional catalysts still missing, inflows concentrated in BTC, fear at extreme levels, and the Altcoin Season Index slipping, broader capital hasn’t entered yet. This is keeping smart money on the sidelines for now. So, while the crypto market today sparked some hope, it’s too early to call a bottom. The bright side – Bullish signals may be still intact, driving the rebound, with a market top nowhere in sight.

Title: Ondo turns to Figure’s stablecoin with $25M investment to back tokenized fund

Time Published: 2025-11-24T18:37:20Z

The investment broadens Ondo Finance’s onchain Treasury reserves and comes amid a renewed push into crypto-backed lending across fintechs, lenders and exchanges. Ondo Finance bought $25 million worth of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized US Treasurys fund. The company said Monday that YLDS will be added to a reserves portfolio that already includes tokenized Treasury products from major asset managers, including funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Designed for institutional investors, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) offers onchain exposure to Treasurys with 24/7 redemptions and an estimated annual return of 3.68%. The tokenized fund had about $777 million in total value locked (TVL) as of this writing. Figure runs lending and capital-markets infrastructure on the Provenance blockchain, and has originated more than $19 billion in loans across home-equity lines, mortgage products, and crypto-backed credit. The deal follows Figure’s completion of its Nasdaq IPO earlier this year. According to DefiLlama data, its YLDS stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $100 million. Ondo Finance is a US-based platform founded in 2021 that tokenizes traditional financial assets. In October, the company expanded its tokenized asset lineup to BNB Chain, adding more than 100 tokenized Wall Street stocks and exchange-traded funds onchain. On Wednesday, the platform received regulatory approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) to offer tokenized stocks in Europe. Figure’s stock price was up nearly 4% in early trading on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Ondo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq’s tokenized securities plan Crypto-backed lending is gaining traction globally, and the trend has accelerated in 2025 as more lenders revive and expand crypto-collateralized loan products. In July, Block Earner introduced Bitcoin-backed home loans in Australia, offering borrowers cash worth up to half a property’s value, with the crypto collateral safeguarded by Fireblocks. On Tuesday, stablecoin issuer Tether announced an investment in Ledn, a platform that provides Bitcoin-backed consumer loans. In the third quarter, Ledn reported originating over $390 million in BTC-backed loans. Centralized exchanges are also expanding into this space and broadening their offerings beyond Bitcoin (BTC). On Thursday, Coinbase rolled out Ether-backed loans for US customers, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC against their Ether (ETH) holdings. Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have handled about $1.28 billion in loan originations since launching earlier this year, according to Dune data.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Wall Street funds, including BlackRock , have been cutting MicroStrategy exposure because the original “high-beta Bitcoin proxy” trade has broken down and the risk/reward on MSTR now looks worse than just owning Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs directly. A mix of aggressive dilution, leverage, governance concerns, and looming index/mandate issues has turned what was a clean proxy into something closer to a complex, quasi-closed-end Bitcoin fund with rising structural risks.

Title: Arthur Hayes Forecasts BTC Drop Below $80K Ahead of Fed QT Halt
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/arthur-hayes-forecasts-btc-drop-below-80k-ahead-of-fed-qt-halt/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T16:08:11Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin may dip below $80K before the Fed ends QT on Dec 1. Market liquidity shows early signs of improvement. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement. Hayes believes that this could probably lead to a Bitcoin BTC $87 595 24h volatility: 0.3% Market cap: $1.75 T Vol. 24h: $65.32 B price recovery, while staying confident that liquidity conditions would improve after the US Federal Reserve ends quantitative tightening (QT) on December 1. Crypto industry veteran Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin may continue to trade below the $90,000 level in the near term. He also flagged the possibility of one final BTC price move toward the low-$80,000 range. However, he believes the $80,000 level is likely to hold as support. minor improvements in $ liq:– fed qt stops dec 1, this wed will prob be last fall in b/s– us banks increased lending in nov we chop below $90k, maybe one more stab down into low $80k's but i think $80k holds. might start nibbling, but leave the bazooka until the new year — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 24, 2025 Despite the pullback, Hayes indicated he is considering small accumulation but plans to delay larger purchases until early next year. Hayes says macro liquidity trends are showing early signs of improvement, while highlighting two key developments. The first is that the U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to halt quantitative tightening on December 1. The other big improvement is that U.S. banks increased lending activity in November. Both hint at greater liquidity, which could benefit risk-on assets like BTC and digital assets. In a similar prediction, market research firm Swissblock noted a sharp decline in its “Risk-Off Signal,” indicating that the most intense phase of selling may have passed. The firm added that any remaining weakness is likely to appear as a smaller, secondary wave, potentially signaling seller exhaustion. This ultimately signals a shift towards buying momentum ahead. As per data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded US$1.94 billion in outflows last week, extending the four-week total to US$4.92 billion. This marks the third-largest continuous outflow period since 2018. Bitcoin accounted for the largest share, with US$1.27 billion exiting the asset during the week, amid the BTC price correction. However, the report noted a partial reversal on Friday, when the asset saw US$225 million in inflows. Last week, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF saw record outflows, leading the pack. The early trading hours on Monday, November 24, show that the fund continues to bleed further. BlackRock just deposited another 2,822 $BTC($243.59M) and 36,283 $ETH($101.72M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/cAFKd0xDCY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 24, 2025 Ethereum ETH $2 933 24h volatility: 1.2% Market cap: $354.37 B Vol. 24h: $22.78 B also faced significant pressure, with US$589 million withdrawn.

In early 2021, an army of retail traders made massive bets on meme stocks and briefly melted down the market. Trading volume swelled to such a huge extent that popular brokerage Robinhood had to halt buy orders for stocks like GameStop for a few days in order to escape a liquidity crisis. At the time, the situation led to claims of a conspiracy, but the reason for the meltdown was more mundane: Wall Street’s creaky infrastructure could not settle trades fast enough. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and others called for an overhaul, and since then there has already been progress, as stock trades now settle a day sooner than in 2021. But the financial industry is also pushing ahead with a more radical solution: turning stocks into digital assets that can be traded and settled instantly on a blockchain. It is not just crypto firms and fintech players leading this charge for “tokenization.” Big banks like J.P. Morgan are also using blockchains to facilitate trades in certain assets and, in doing so, transforming the financial ecosystem more broadly. Already, tokenization—which Tenev has described as a “freight train” poised to eat Wall Street—has brought fundamental changes to how stocks and other assets are traded. The potential upsides to tokenization are huge, but significant questions remain over how to implement it. Meanwhile, some fear the coming train could undermine some protections for individual “retail” investors and destabilize a U.S. equities market whose reliability has for decades been the envy of the world. The tokenization wave isn’t the first push to overhaul Wall Street’s under-the-hood operations. In the 1970s, traders confronted what became known as the “paperwork crisis,” which saw stock markets, drowning in orders, shut down mid-week simply to keep up with recordkeeping. Repeated work stoppages finally led to a computer-based solution. “Once upon a time there were leather-bound journals that said who owns all the stock,” explains Robert Leshner, a former economist who now runs the tokenization firm Superstate. “Then, people said, ‘This is too hard, let’s not update anymore,’ so they decided to create a legal fiction that assigned ownership of all the stock to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation,” or DTCC. The DTCC regime, which has been in place for decades, means it’s no longer necessary to record every single share transfer. Instead, the clearinghouse keeps track of the stock held by different brokerages on behalf of their customers and settles up transactions between those brokerages the next business day. Under this system, the brokerages nominally own the stock, but all the rights that attach to it—dividends, voting privileges, and so on—remain with the customers. The system has worked pretty well over the decades, and for those who insist on doing things the old-fashioned way, DTCC means they can still demand physical copies of their shares. (This option is popular with “GameStop truthers,” who believe reverting to paper will thwart a Wall Street conspiracy against retail investors.) Now, though, the current DTCC system of “T+1”—in which the clearinghouse closes out trades the next business day by reconciling accounts among brokerages—has come to feel outdated in an age when so much business is conducted instantly and around the clock. This has prompted companies like Leshner’s Superstate to offer a faster alternative. The startup is working with companies to issue versions of their shares that trade on a blockchain, an arrangement under which the firms don’t have to rely on intermediaries to hold or track their stock. It also means stock trades can be settled instantly, while allowing firms to interact with their shareholders more directly. Outside the U.S., tokenized assets are already helping investors avoid big trading commissions and invest in private companies like SpaceX Other firms are approaching tokenization in a different fashion. Robinhood, for example, doesn’t help firms tokenize their stocks, but instead takes stocks available on the open market and offers them in a blockchain “wrapper” as a sort of derivative. These offerings are currently available only in Europe, where stock owners can buy and sell the “Stock Tokens” alongside assets like Bitcoin. Retail investors unfamiliar with tokenization may be surprised, and possibly alarmed, to discover that a company they own is trading in the crypto-verse. For now, at least, it’s not something to worry about.Currently, even tokenization boosters say the new blockchain system will exist alongside the old one rather than replace it. So why do all this in the first place? For the average investor who trades only from time to time, the arrival of tokenized assets won’t mean much. Active traders, though, will appreciate the move to blockchain, since it opens the door for more trading after hours and on weekends. The new regime will also be appealing to institutional investors, since it will free up collateral that might otherwise be tied up waiting for settlement. “Imagine you’re a hedge fund and want to buy $1 million of Tesla stock,” says Johann Kerbrat, SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “You buy it on Friday, so you don’t have the money anymore, but you don’t get the shares in your account until Monday. So for three days, you can’t do anything.” It’s not just stocks being tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, working with Superstate’s tokenization rival Securitize, offers access to money-market funds and U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, and has already grown to $2 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile,J.P. Morgan is offering tokenized versions of private equity assets on its in-house Kinexys blockchain, in part because the process makes capital calls easier to track and manage. This is likely just the beginning. Rob Hadick, a partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, notes that other realms of finance like credit and fixed income are still conducted primarily in pre-digital fashion, with some transactions still made official by means of a fax. A switch to tokenization could enable such transactions to settle faster and more reliably. Hadick says it will also produce savings for banks and brokerages since it will reduce the ranks of back-office staff and disrupt specialized middlemen who handle tasks like loan origination and servicing fees. Meanwhile, for traders of all sorts, tokenized assets will be easier to move across brokerages or post as collateral. It is still early days, especially in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the green light to tokenized equities. As of mid-November, the total value of such assets worldwide was about $660 million, according to research site RWA.xyz; the most popular ones include tokenized versions of index-tracking ETFs and Big Tech stocks such as Tesla, Nvidia, and Alphabet. But that nascent state hasn’t stopped brokerages from pushing forward, including crypto shop Kraken, whose tokenized versions of select U.S. stocks are doing a brisk trade in markets like Brazil and South Africa, where traders still pay hefty commissions that can amount to 10% or more, even as such fees have largely been eliminated in the U.S. Robinhood, meanwhile, got its hands on shares of privately held OpenAI and SpaceX, and has given away tokenized versions of them to European customers. As for the DTCC, it would be easy to assume the clearinghouse opposes the tokenization wave. Quite the opposite: According to two sources familiar with the company, the outfit is eager to move into blockchain, partly because it offers a potential way to expand into private markets. Asked for comment, the DTCC did not provide details but did suggest it is embracing the technology. “DTCC believes in the power and potential of tokenization to evolve and modernize market infrastructure. We are actively working to enable capabilities that further our products and services,” said Brian Steele, DTCC’s president of clearing and securities services. Not everyone is convinced a rush to tokenization is a good thing. Those urging caution include Citadel Securities, which has asked the SEC to adopt a go-slow approach. According to a source close to the firm, the trading giant fears that some crypto-aligned firms want to use the rulemaking process around tokenization to gain exemptions from long-standing consumer protection obligations. The person also expressed concern that a rapid shift could undermine trust in a U.S. equities market that is the biggest in the world and has been fine-tuned for decades. This concern may not be unfounded. Already, there have been notable discrepancies between the prices of traditional shares of a company’s stock and the prices of tokenized versions offered by the likes of Kraken. Meanwhile, it’s unclear if every firm offering tokenized equities has put in place adequate guardrails when it comes to custody and fiduciary obligations to the customer. What happens, for instance, in the event of a crypto firm going bankrupt while holding tokenized shares of a customer’s stock? And while every financial institution appears to view blockchain as the technology of the future, they may not agree as to which blockchain. Robinhood, among others, is relying on the open-source Ethereum chain to build out its tokenization business, while J.P. Morgan appears wedded to its own proprietary chain. According to Hadick, the venture capitalist, this situation could slow adoption, since, he says, other big firms like Goldman Sachs will be reluctant to rely on a blockchain controlled by a rival. Hadick adds, though, that any impasse is unlikely to last long, since “one thing blockchains do well is coordinate trust.” This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline: “Get ready to own a tokenized portfolio.” This article is part of Fortune’s 2025 Investor’s Guide.

MAGA Liz Wolfe | 11.24.2025 9:30 AM Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. "I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more," the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video: My message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1 — Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025 Greene struck predictably populist America First notes ("Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests") and mapped her disagreements with the president ("H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Until recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a "ranting lunatic." The Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. "I don't see political party lines," said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs. "I don't know what happened to Marjorie," said Trump recently. "Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think." Many of her constituents are still behind her. "I feel like she has stood her ground," Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of "unwavering support" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. "She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times. Scenes from New York: "Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again," argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. "In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'" Q: Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist? MAMDANI: I've spoken about-- TRUMP: That's okay. You can just say yes.

Title: Average rents at almost €4,000 a month in Ireland’s priciest area

Landlords in Foxrock, Co Dublin, are commanding the highest average rents in the State at almost €4,000 a month, latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows. Renting a home in the south Dublin neighbourhood in the first quarter of this year would set a household back an average of €3,718 a month, said the CSO. Areas in south Dublin had the top 10 highest rents at the start of the year, with Goatstown in second place (€3,104 per month), followed by Dalkey, Killiney, Glenageary, Sandymount, Booterstown, Blackrock, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook, where average rents were €2,547. Outside Dublin the highest rents were in Greystones and Delgany, both in Co Wicklow (€2,331 and €2,077 per month), Bishopstown, Co Cork (€2,043) and Barna, Co Galway (€1,961). Across local authority housing, there was a 6 per cent increase in rents on average over the 12 months to September 2025. The rental figures, drawn from Residential Tenancies Board statistics, are among a wealth of information collated on the CSO’s housing information hub, including property prices, housing commencements and completions, planning permissions and vacant dwellings numbers. Property prices continued to increase this year compared with last, though by almost twice as much outside Dublin (9.4 per cent) as in the capital (5.3 per cent). On new homes, the number of dwellings granted planning permission was down 13 per cent – from 8,513 units in the third quarter of last year to 7,447 in 2025. However, the number of dwelling completions was up 13 per cent in the first three quarters of the year, standing at 24,325, compared with the same period in 2024. There were 177,600 people working in the construction industry. Among these, 67 per cent mainly worked on new housing developments or renovations. Average hourly labour costs for the sector were €34.22 in third quarter of this year, up from €30.85 in the second quarter of last year. Data shows that home heating fuels of choice are changing. As of the third quarter this year the most common main heating fuel across all dwellings was gas (35 per cent), followed by heating oil and electricity. For homes built since 2015 however, the most common heating fuel was electricity. Homes constructed from 2020 to the third quarter of this year were 93 per cent electrically heated, with 6 per cent using gas and less than 1 per cent using oil. Statistics on building energy ratings (BERs) show Kildare had the highest proportion of A-rated homes (28 per cent), followed by Meath (27 per cent) and Dublin county (27 per cent), while the lowest were in Leitrim and Cork city (both 5 per cent). The highest proportions of G-rated dwellings were in counties Roscommon and Leitrim (11 per cent). [ ‘I don’t think Balbriggan was ready for this amount of people’: The challenges facing a Dublin commuter townOpens in new window ] In the Dublin postal districts, the highest proportions of A-rated homes were in Dublin 18 which includes Foxrock, Sandyford and Stepaside (43 per cent), Dublin 13 including Sutton and Howth (31 per cent), and Dublin 20 including Chapelizod and Palmerstown (28 per cent). The lowest level of A ratings in the capital was 7 per cent in Dublin 7, which includes Cabra, Phibsborough and Smithfield. In the last three months of 2023, the estimated national vacancy rate was 3.3 per cent based on low to zero electricity consumption in a dwelling. The local authorities with the highest vacancy rates this period were Leitrim (8.5 per cent), Roscommon (6.5 per cent) and Mayo (6.4 per cent).

Title: Crypto is getting punched in the face again—but this is no 2022

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. It’s getting ugly out there. On Friday, Bitcoin’s latest swoon saw it fall to $82,000, marking a drop of around 32% from its all-time high of $126,000. That high came just last month, but it now feels like a distant memory as exchanges liquidate over-leveraged traders, and retail buyers curse the day a cousin gave them that tip about Bonk coin. So just how much lower will prices drop? There’s a good chance that $82,000 is not the bottom. While prices have rallied in the last few days, with Bitcoin trading around $86,000 on Monday morning, it’s easy to envision scenarios where it drops to $70,000 or lower. A jolt of dour macro-economic news or a major scandal (more on that in a second), and we could be right back in Crypto Winter. As for how we got here, it’s pretty clear that Oct. 10 was the catalyst for the current malaise. That was the day that saw around $19 billion of forced liquidations—underscoring the perils that go with allowing crypto cowboys to leverage their positions by as much as 100x. That wipeout, in turn, spooked the many institutional investors that rushed into the sector amid the euphoria that came with President Donald Trump’s favorable regulatory policies. It turned out that it was just as easy for them to rush out again. The crypto industry’s painful financial month, one of its worst on record, is also bad for its already-tarnished reputation. Longtime haters will be keen to jump in with the familiar narrative that crypto is little more than a nest of fools and swindlers, and that it’s the Sam Bankman-Fried era all over again. That view, however, is mistaken. The crypto collapse of 2022, which saw Bitcoin fall as low as $16,000, was indeed touched off by a wave of fraud. The villains included not only Bankman-Fried, but figures like stablecoin scammer Do Kwon and Alex Mashinsky, who ran a “trusted” centralized platform for crypto deposits. Conversely, there is no major scandal driving crypto’s current woes—though we could, of course, see some nasty stuff get exposed if prices keep falling. All of this, though, can make it easy to overlook just how much bigger the crypto industry is today, and how much its underlying infrastructure has matured. Sure, some institutional investors have gotten cold feet about buying tokens, but there are a lot of very big names—think BlackRock and now Citadel Securities—which have made clear they are in for the long haul. The fact of the matter is that blockchain technology is simply superior to the legacy software that most of the financial system relies on, and Wall Street is ready for an upgrade. This process is just beginning, and it will ensure ongoing adoption of marquee crypto projects like Ethereum and Solana. It also won’t be long until DeFi systems become interwoven with the broader financial system. As my lawyer pal Marvin Ammori noted, the daily trading volume on the DeFi exchange Uniswap is equal to a month of trading volume on Kalshi, which is being treated as the hottest thing in town. The bottom line here is that crypto is taking its lumps right now, but things are not as bad as they seem. The downturn will serve to wash some of the worst grifters out of the industry, and force those left to step up and prove they are building something of value. This will happen but it could be a while before we see Bitcoin at $126,000 again. Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Another TradFi convert: Citadel Securities, the market making giant owned by mega-billionaire Ken Griffin, is investing $200 million into Kraken. The deal suggests Citadel, which had previously avoided crypto, sees a future in tokenization. (Fortune) SPACs smacked: A bid by Pomp to take his DAT public through a reverse merger got rebuffed when the partner vehicle called off the deal on the grounds it was bad for shareholders. Other would-be crypto SPACs are also facing skepticism—a far cry from 2021 when the gimmick was widely used to enrich insiders at the expense of retail investors. (Bloomberg) Jamie debanks Jack: Strike CEO Jack Mallers complained on Twitter that JPMorgan Chase terminated his accounts over unspecified “concerning activity,” leading crypto figures Bo Hines to complain that the outspoken Bitcoin maxi had been debanked. (Decrypt) Dirty money bonanza: A major global news investigation found at least $28 billion worth of criminal funds from pig butchers, North Korean hackers and others have flowed into Binance, OKX and other exchanges in the last two years, in part from ask-no-question storefronts. (New York Times) DePIN drone network: The sector known as decentralized physical infrastructure has been in the dog house since the Helium debacle. Now a drone-tracking startup wants to build out its network by selling $949 sensors and paying out a new type of token for contributing to its network. Sure, but why not just use stablecoins instead? (Fortune) Former JPM exec and noted ‘permabull’ Tom Lee takes the main character crown this week for his bullish or perhaps delusional assurances that everything is great, even as his leading Ethereum DAT is badly underwater. Points for staying on message, Tom. The timeline is suddenly full of McDonald’s memes—a mainstay of bear markets as crypto bros joke about being so ruined they have to sling fries. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Saudi Aramco Weighs Raising Billions Of Dollars From Its Biggest Disposals Yet

Saudi Aramco is considering plans to raise billions of dollars by selling a range of assets, people familiar with the matter said, deals that could rank as its most significant disposals ever. The firm is weighing the sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals as part of the plans, the people said, declining to be identified as the information is confidential. Banks have been asked to pitch for roles on feasibility studies for the disposals, which could fetch more than $10 billion, they said. Aramco is eying options including raising fresh equity from the deal, the people said. It could also pursue a structure similar to the recent $11 billion lease transaction with a group led by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners for assets linked to the Jafurah gas project, they said. That sale drew interest from firms around the world and bankers have since pitched several asset disposal plans given increasing demand from investors, one of the people said. Aramco’s terminals business is seen as a lucrative asset and the company could kick off a formal sales process as soon as early next year, the person said. At the same time, the oil giant is considering selling part of its real estate portfolio, some of the people said. Those assets will also likely be worth billions of dollars and will be seen as attractive at a time when the kingdom is advancing plans to allow foreign ownership. Discussions are at an early stage and no final decisions have been made. Representatives for Aramco didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Aramco’s main oil storage and export infrastructure is located at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and the company has similar terminals on the Red Sea. Internationally, the firm owns stakes in product terminals in the Netherlands and leases crude as well as product storage at main trade hubs in Egypt and at Okinawa in Japan. Oil prices have dropped by roughly a fifth this year and while that decline has somewhat been tempered by higher output, Aramco has delayed some projects and looked to sell assets to free up cash for investments. The deals now being considered would mark a step up from previous transactions that were focused on stakes in pipeline infrastructure. The world’s biggest oil exporter is a lynchpin of the Saudi economy. Revenue from energy sales and the firm’s hefty dividend payouts help support the kingdom’s expensive economic revamp, some elements of which have been hamstrung by growing costs. Meanwhile, Aramco is continuing to invest in big-ticket projects like Jafurah, which is set to start production this year and reach full capacity in 2030.

Title: 6 Affordable ETFS for Dividend Aristocrats

Company dividends are a crucial part of a stock’s total return. These ETFs track firms with strong records of quarterly payouts. The Daily Upside Staff squad@thedailyupside.com The old proverb that warns against judging a book by its cover dates at least to ancient Rome, and it applies to subjects far beyond its literal meaning, including investments. It’s easy for retail investors to grow mesmerized by the surface-level performance of hourly, daily or even annual, ups and downs of the market. While those shifts tell more than the cover story, it’s still only part of the story, and dividends can be another critical indicator of, and contributor to, value. Over the past century, payments comprising a portion of cash proceeds from operations have made up 31% of the S&P 500’s total return on a pro-forma basis, according to S&P Global Research. (The statistic includes hypothetical returns for some periods, since the index itself wasn’t created until 1957.) During some decades, such as the 1940s and 1970s, dividends have made up more than half of returns, and thanks to the miracles of compounding, they can drive investors’ gains exponentially higher. Compound for Pound Including dividends, the S&P 500’s return from January 1930 to February 2025 would have been 9,584 points, compared with just 278 points excluding the payouts, according to the data. Investors seeking to take advantage of such multiples don’t have to find high-dividend stocks on their own: A number of exchange-traded funds offer simplified access. They’re not all created equal, however. The following list highlights six funds that pair attractive price-to-earning ratios with holdings known for dividend quality, ranked from lowest to highest. While there’s only one ETF on the market that focuses solely on dividend aristocrats, companies that have raised dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, each of the funds offers access to firms with a strong payout record: Digital asset treasury companies are grappling with the law of diminishing returns in the midst of a cryptocurrency swoon. What’s next? Despite concerns ahead of the busiest season for retailers, projections show Americans are ready to open their wallets. Nvidia faced “the tough task of meeting high earnings expectations and high skepticism around AI capex,” per analysts at Bank of America. Bitcoin has so far fallen 20% from its 2025 peak this cycle; in previous bear markets, it fell as much as 30% to 40%. The cult hero/curiosity has launched a social media broadside against the AI trade that has fueled this year’s market rally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick warned of an equities drawdown on Tuesday at a summit in Hong Kong. Metsera on Tuesday called Novo Nordisk’s new $10 billion offer “superior” to rival Pfizer’s bid of $8 billion. The company has been one of the top beneficiaries of Trump administration policies, with US revenue climbing 68% year-over-year in Q2. Still in the “early innings of its growth story,” Robinhood has morphed from an app with crowdsourced stock advice to a financial ecosystem. Life is notoriously tough for those on the bottom rung of the Wall Street ladder, where weeks can stretch up to 100 hours. Disclosures by two regional lenders last week set off a mini-panic about bad loans on the books of small and medium cap banks. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Crypto treasuries facing $130 billion value reckoning as ETFs reshape market

EFT impact and "crypto-per-share" focus redefine corporate treasury strategies in the crypto market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investors long paid premiums for Digital Asset Treasury firms, seeing them as practical substitutes for holding Bitcoin when direct access was limited. That approach worked when regulated channels were scarce and corporate balance sheets offered the closest approximation to holding the asset itself. But according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, the conditions that once supported those valuations have fundamentally changed. In a valuation framework released on Nov. 23, Hougan argued that the $130 billion sector now faces a structural shift. While the forces pushing DATs below the value of their crypto holdings, illiquidity, operating costs, and execution risk, are constant across the model, the factors that can lift valuations above parity are limited and uncertain. The natural state of a passive treasury, he wrote, is a discount. Hougan’s analysis challenges the assumptions that fueled the rise of companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet Inc., which built investment cases around holding large quantities of Bitcoin. His model treats spot-value parity as the starting point and subtracts three predictable valuation drags. The first is illiquidity. Bitcoin held inside a corporation cannot be redeemed directly by shareholders, and the friction between ownership and access typically results in a discount. Hougan described this gap as the price investors assign to delayed or constrained delivery of the underlying asset. The second is operating expense. Public companies incur recurring costs, including compensation, audits, custody arrangements, and legal services. Those expenses reduce net asset value on a continuous basis, meaning a dollar of Bitcoin held by a corporation is inherently worth less than a dollar held directly. The third is execution risk. Investors must account for the possibility that management will misallocate capital, misjudge markets, or face regulatory setbacks. Because the probability is non-zero, markets generally factor this risk into pricing. Hougan wrote: “Most of the reasons they should trade at a discount are certain and most of the reasons they might trade at a premium are uncertain…Expenses and risk compound over time.” Taken together, these factors form the baseline markdown that applies to most DAT structures before any upside levers are considered. The downward pressure on DAT valuations has intensified with the expansion of spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds. Before ETF approvals, corporate treasuries served as the primary entry point for institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure without the custody complexity. That scarcity allowed some DAT stocks to trade well above their underlying holdings. The introduction of spot ETFs removed that structural advantage. BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and other issuers now offer low-fee products that track Bitcoin and ETH directly, with intraday liquidity and daily creations and redemptions. Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth, called spot ETFs “DAT killers,” arguing that they closed the regulatory arbitrage that once justified premium pricing. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that ETFs perform the same function as DATs “with good tracking,” providing cleaner exposure while avoiding the overhead of a corporate structure. He acknowledged that some institutions can hold only equities or bonds, which gives companies like MicroStrategy residual appeal. Still, he noted that this group is “not enough for a bunch of them to thrive.” With the premium model eroding, Hougan argues that a DAT’s valuation now depends on its ability to increase crypto per share. Only four strategies reliably support that objective: issuing debt to buy more crypto, lending assets for yield, using options strategies, and acquiring assets at a discount. Issuing debt is historically the most powerful tool, particularly when credit markets are favorable and Bitcoin is appreciating. If the asset consistently outperforms the interest burden, shareholders can achieve accretive gains. But the strategy relies on timing, balance-sheet strength, and access to capital markets. Lending, structured products, and options generate incremental returns but introduce counterparty or strategy risk. Mergers and acquisitions can increase scale, lowering financing costs and expanding the set of transactions a DAT can pursue. Hougan said “scale matters” because larger firms can access cheaper capital and better deal flow. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley expects these pressures to accelerate consolidation. “We’re in the early innings of what DATs will become,” he said, predicting that surviving firms will evolve into operating companies that buy private crypto businesses and generate revenue rather than relying solely on treasury appreciation. Considering this, Hougan concluded: “Going forward, I think there will be more differentiation. A few will execute well and trade at a premium, and many will execute poorly and trade at a discount. This model is one way to think about which is which.” The move toward more disciplined valuation coincides with losses across Bitcoin treasury stocks. Research from 10X Research estimates that retail investors lost about $17 billion in recent months as markets repriced corporate holdings. The firm attributed these losses to the collapse of what it described as “financial alchemy,” where share issuance created the appearance of expanding upside until volatility erased the effect. Data from CryptoRank indicates sector-wide dispersion. Treasuries with high operating costs, limited scale, or large sell-side overhangs have underperformed, while firms focused on crypto-per-share expansion have been more resilient. Taken together, these shifts suggest that DATs must now compete directly with ETFs on cost, liquidity, and transparency. The period in which corporate balance sheets commanded automatic premiums is no longer supported by market structure. For the largest players, the challenge is proving they operate businesses rather than functioning as static balance-sheet vehicles. Firms that cannot offset expense drag or grow crypto-per-share are likely to trade at structural discounts, while those adopting active strategies may retain a valuation advantage. As ETFs capture a larger share of institutional flows, the market is sending a clear signal: simply holding Bitcoin is no longer enough. A DAT must demonstrate it can generate value beyond its treasury, or its equity will reflect the underlying arithmetic. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature” — Max Planck Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with an essay by SEPP director David Legates rebutting a claim that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. TWTW discusses a version of uncertainty proposed by John Ridgway. TWTW discusses Ross McKitrick’s paper of a statistically acceptable way of climate fingerprinting. Then, TWTW discusses an essay and a speech by two commentators on UK energy policy. TWTW closes with an effort by the UNFCCC to impose censorship. ********************* General Patterns v. Specific Details: NOAA research scientist Nadir Jeevanjee claims that today’s complex global climate models accurately forecast climate. As evidence, he offers five forecasts for which the early simple models in a lab of the U.S. Weather Bureau were accurate. The laboratory became the NOAA-financed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton. Jeevanjee claims that the report by five independent scientists (John Christy, Ph.D., Judith Curry, Ph.D., Steven Koonin, Ph.D., Ross McKitrick, Ph.D., Roy Spencer, Ph.D.) published by the Department of Energy in July 2025 claimed that the complexity of current global climate models as the primary reason why the models cannot be trusted. Jeevanjee gave five major examples why current models can be trusted. Writing for the Cornwall Alliance, climatologist David Legates rebutted each example. As posted in WUWT, Legates states [the graph is not shown here but is in the text, boldface added]: Okay, let’s revisit history—because those who can’t remember history correctly are destined to get it wrong. First, we need to get one fact correct. The recent Department of Energy report did not simply cite the complexity of climate models as the primary reason they cannot be trusted. It goes into detail as to why current climate models cannot be trusted: namely, they cannot reproduce current conditions. For example, models are not capable of determining the equilibrium climate sensitivity to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. As shown in this graph from the DOE report, they tend to ‘run hot,’ or overstate surface warming. [graph not shown here] They also overstate warming of the tropical troposphere, and their simulation of stratospheric cooling is inconsistent. With regards to the tropical troposphere, the excessive warming was noted as a problem in the first United States National Climate Assessment and has been noted in every Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report since. This problem has become more extreme over time—i.e., simulations from later models, despite decades of ‘improvements’ costing billions of dollars, deviate farther from observations than earlier models—and its spatial extent now encompasses the entire globe. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. It concludes, ‘it is this track record of success that gives us confidence in interpreting the changes we’re seeing now, as well as predicting changes to come.’ It then lists five forecasts the early models made that underscore how well even those early models could reproduce Earth’s climate. Now, let’s give credit where credit is due, but let’s not reward models for getting the basics of climate correct. In other words, models should not be praised for figuring out that the Poles are cold and the Equator is warm. They should not be given credit for simulating the Hadley Cell circulation or demonstrating that oceans have a moderating effect on climate, for examples. These basic premises of climate are obvious and must have been a product of the simulation; otherwise, the models would have been discarded before they were even published. So, let’s test the article’s evaluation of the models. Forecast number 1: early models correctly simulated surface global warming from increased carbon dioxide. Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise. Way back in 1896, Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927) showed that an increase in carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures. The question always has been, and still is, how much should the temperature rise from, say, a doubling of carbon dioxide? Early models argued that the temperature rise would be between 2.0 and 3.5 degrees Celsius. These numbers are actually closer to reality than estimates provided by later model simulations, but they are still higher than data-driven estimates using historical and paleoclimate data. Verdict? Early models would have been discarded if they had simulated cooling or had no effect. That they simulated warming from increased greenhouse gases is no proof of their reliability. Forecast number 2: the models predicted stratospheric cooling from adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This should also have been relatively obvious. If outgoing terrestrial radiation is being intercepted by more carbon dioxide at the surface, and some of it is radiated back to the surface, then less will reach the stratosphere and, consequently, the stratosphere should cool. Again, the question that demands an answer is, ‘How much cooling?’—and even current climate models cannot simulate this correctly or consistently. Forecast number 3: Arctic amplification. The Conversation suggests that it was surprising that the early models accurately predicted that rising carbon dioxide concentrations would warm the Arctic more than the Tropics. But that was no surprise at all. Given a warming planet, the Arctic will warm faster than the Equator due to six factors. Therefore, a greater warming of the Arctic was obvious to climatologists even before the first climate model was created. That models simulate it is no big feat. Forecast number 4: land-ocean contrast. The article notes that the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ‘led to a slew of insights, including the observation that land generally warms more than ocean, by a factor of about 1.5.’ While this may sound impressive to the uninitiated, climatologists have long known the moderating effect of the oceans, again due to their high specific heat. Consider San Diego and Dallas, at about the same latitude of 33 degrees north. The annual temperature range in San Diego is about 8 degrees Celsius, while that in Dallas is about 22 degrees—a factor of almost three. Extending any transect to both coasts indicates that the annual temperature range—and the diurnal temperature range, for that matter—increases with distance from the coast. To anyone who understands the Earth’s climate, the central Plains have a much greater temperature range than either coast, for example. So, why would this have been a novel finding back in 1979? Any competent climatologist would have known this, so it must have been a basic component of any climate model worth its salt at the time. Forecast number 5: delayed warming of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. This issue arises from the supposedly novel fact that the Arctic has a greater warming signal than that of the Southern Ocean. But why is that surprising? The change in albedo is not as great in Antarctica, since there is little land area exposed by melting snow and ice, while there is much in the Arctic. Sea ice dynamics differ considerably in the Southern Hemisphere, and the loss of sea ice isn’t as dramatic to warming Antarctica. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is bounded by a hemisphere of ocean, which has a moderating effect on the climate as mentioned earlier. Thus, important contributions to Arctic warming are not present in the Southern Ocean, and so we would have expected the Southern Ocean to be different from the Arctic. The take-home message? If early climate models missed any of these supposed climate novelties, climate modeling wouldn’t have gotten off the ground. What early climate modeling showed was that the basics of climate could be replicated with simple mathematical approximations. But that’s the basics. The details are that climate is still very complex, and while the general patterns can be simulated accurately, specific details as to how climate varies spatially and how it is likely to change under various scenarios are still a far-off challenge. The article concludes: ‘Climate models have their limitations, of course. For instance, they cannot predict regional climate change as well as people would like. But the fact that climate science, like any field, has significant unknowns should not blind us to what we do know.’ I agree, but I would also note that we were not blind to these facts before the advent of climate models. Syukuro Manabe deserves credit for demonstrating that the basics of climate can be reproduced with a rudimentary computer program run on early computers. But the fact remains that current model simulations still deviate significantly from real-world observations. And let’s not lose sight of the fact that early climatologists understood quite a bit about how the Earth’s climate works. Yes, there were climatologists before the climate modelers, and they knew an awful lot about the Earth’s climate. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Uncertainty: As David Legates writes above, the global climate models are highly inconsistent and generally greatly overestimate the warming of the atmosphere. Modelers often dismiss criticism of the inconsistency and the overestimate as the result of “initial conditions.” If the initial conditions are accurate, part of the inconsistency in modeling results can be attributed to initial conditions, but the overestimates may be from the use of the wrong data to detect the greenhouse effect. In two essays posted on Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. and one in Climate Scepticism (English spelling) John Ridgway addresses the issues of uncertainty. In the second essay posted in Climate Etc. “Natural Selection of Bad Science. Part II,” Ridgway discusses “Distinguishing Two Dimensions of Uncertainty” by Craig Fox and Gülden Ülkümen. The issues arise from the fact that modeling is not measurement and the efforts to attach probability estimates on a range of modeling results are without any foundation in classical probability and statistics. For example, if modelers state the results are a of range of 1.5 – 4.5°C, they don’t have a sound statistical basis for attaching probabilities to these estimates. In a long post on Curry’s website, Ridgway address this issue and efforts to minimize it. He states: “…the problem didn’t go away, and we now live in a world where it is common practice for climate scientists to confuse epistemic and aleatory uncertainty by trying to treat the spread of model outputs as if dealing with a measurement problem that can be characterized using probability distributions. It’s possible that some climate scientists are simply unaware of the issue, but many others deliberately ignore it because they recognize the expedience of pretending that the epistemic uncertainties involved can be analyzed as if they were aleatory.” [Boldface added.] Here Ridgway introduces terms that may be from philosophy: “epistemic uncertainties” and “aleatory uncertainties.” Epistemic uncertainty arises for a lack of knowledge (incomplete understanding in a model) and possibly could be resolved by gathering more data or better data. Aleatoric uncertainty arises because of the unpredictable, random nature of the physical system (randomness and noise). This uncertainty cannot be resolved by more and better data. The distinction is useful because it may be helpful to address issues that arise when global climate modelers dismiss criticisms of the inconsistency of their work as resulting from “initial conditions.” For example, turbulence is a vexing problem in fluid dynamics that no one has solved. Turbulence can be considered an aleatory uncertainty, it is random. In climate modeling, turbulence will produce different results with different initial conditions. However, the use of surface-air temperature data for modeling is not an aleatory uncertainty. It is the wrong data to use if one is forecasting the influence of greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere. Further, surface-air data is subject to many other human influences that have no relationship with greenhouse gases, such as the urban heat island effect, roadways, runways, landscape changes, etc. The variation between surface-air temperature trends and atmospheric temperature trends cannot be dismissed as aleatory uncertainty, random. The differences are epistemic, lacking appropriate knowledge. Yet the appropriate knowledge exists but is ignored by the global climate modeling community. There is no justification for saying the difference is the result of initial conditions. Under Problem number 1: The converted meteorologist in “More on the Uncertainty Monster” Ridgway writes: “’Internal variability, part of the natural variability of the climate system, can be estimated from high-resolution simulators, but it is only a tiny part of total uncertainty. Over centurial scales, it is negligible compared to our combined uncertainty of the behavior of the icesheets, and the marine and terrestrial biosphere.’ As a consequence, the road to improved forecasting is markedly different for the two challenges. For meteorology, improvement is traditionally gained by using simulations of greater fidelity and granularity, powered by extra computer and physical perturbation ensembles of increasing size. For climate science, the solution lies more in gaining a greater understanding of the complexities and feedbacks involved and how they operate in the long term. The distinction is essentially that which exists between variability and incertitude, and hence between the aleatory and epistemic approaches. However, there is always a danger that an individual steeped in the traditions of the former may not be able to fully adjust when engaged in the latter. If Monte Carlo simulations and similar stochastic sampling techniques have proved immensely effective within their realm, the temptation might be to believe that the realm of the epistemic could be similarly tamed. One individual who may fit this description is Professor Tim Palmer, an academic who has done as much as anyone in pioneering and finessing the techniques that underpin modern-day weather forecasting. In his book, The Primacy of Doubt, these successes are described in chapters such as ‘Chaos, Chaos Everywhere,’ ‘The Geometry of Chaos,’ ‘Noisy, Million-Dollar Butterflies’ and ‘The Two Roads to Monte Carlo.’ However, in the chapter ‘Climate Change,’ he states the following when discussing climate change multi-model ensembles: ‘This provides a natural ‘ensemble of opportunity’ to study climate change. It is an example of the so-called multi-model ensemble mentioned in Chapter 5. Each model differs from the others in the precise computational techniques used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, and, more importantly, in the parameterization formulae for unresolved processes.’ There is nothing in the above to suggest that the aleatory sampling techniques he had described in Chapter 5 (Monte Carlo simulation) are anything other than fully applicable to the ensembles he now describes. And yet, Chapter 5 was predominantly about the modelling of variability, whereas now we have moved on to matters of incertitude, as characterized by models of varied structure. Just to reinforce the suspicion that Palmer sees nothing wrong with the adoption of aleatory methods to treat such epistemic uncertainty, on page 121 he reproduces a histogram showing the various estimates of climate sensitivity resulting from an ensemble of differently structured models. Over this he fits a probability distribution curve, seemingly unconcerned that this takes no account of the histogram’s decidedly non-stochastic representation of the space of possible model structures. This is precisely the normative practice to which I have referred above, and yet there is no hint in his book that he sees it as a pragmatic (albeit sub-optimal) expedient, or as a probabilistic treatment adopted only for the benefit of the policymakers. Indeed, he goes on to justify its legitimacy by reference to the concept of the ‘wisdom of the crowds.’ But this is a concept that only applies when the crowd acts entirely independently and is statistically representative. Of course, neither of these conditions apply to the currently available ‘crowd’ of climate models.” Ridgway identifies a major problem with the ensemble method advocated by Tim Palmer and widely used today – the method mixes different types of uncertainties some of which can be resolved with better data while others cannot. Additionally, Palmer writes some ideas of what his technique can resolve that are farfetched. Ridgway writes: “Armed with an ensemble of such models, Palmer sees great potential in tackling the epistemic uncertainties appertaining to our shared future: ‘Of course, such a digital ensemble twin would not only be able to tackle the socioeconomic problems of climate geoengineering, it should be able to provide credible estimates of future migration, future conflict, future health risks, future food supplies, the future health of the oceans and so on.’ Of course? It is far from obvious to me that a reliable ‘model of global society’ can be created by extending a stochastic model designed to forecast the outcome of a system’s variability.” Under “Problem number 2: The denial of subjectivity” Ridgway writes about “Personalist” interpretation of uncertainty that has no bearing in physical science. Physical science deals with verifiable, objective properties independent from one’s individual beliefs. The essays are useful in identifying types of uncertainties, some of which may reduce with more data or the use of appropriate data. Other uncertainties, such as turbulence, probably cannot be reduced even with better and faster computers. The knowledge does not exist. Additionally, our understanding of the formation and dissipation of clouds is lacking.

Earlier, Allen and Tett (1999) claimed that the work satisfied the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem and the estimates are BLUE, [the Best (minimum variance), Linear, Unbiased, Estimator] for the calculation of the coefficient of the desired variable. Writing in the same Journal, Climate Dynamics, Ross McKitrick (2022) showed that the method did not produce BLUE results; the results were not unbiased and consistent estimates of the desired coefficient. A major problem is the lack of consistency of the error term, heteroscedasticity. In discussing Ross McKitrick’s latest work, John Robson writes: “A lot of observers including us have long suspected that the IPCC’s knack for always finding CO2 responsible for everything was probably an artifact of dodgy statistical practice rather than real-world effects. [Ross] McKitrick’s new analysis confirms our suspicions and adds to the evidence that in the real world outside climate models CO2 is not the control knob on global climate and natural variability matters a lot more than we’ve been told. And confirms our suspicions that far from being ‘settled,’ rigorous and, oh yeah, ‘simple,’ climate science neglects basic tools of the trade from the statistical to the testing of hypotheses to try to disprove them not to confirm them at all costs.’ See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* In the Mire: In “Fixing the electricity system” Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch addressed a main problem in the UK – the high and increasing cost of electricity to consumers and industry. His essay begins with [boldface added]: “The UK has the highest industrial electricity prices in the developed world, despite paying only average prices for gas. Independent research shows that years of high energy costs have made the cost-of-living voters’ top concern, fueling public anger and political polarization. Yet even sceptics of the renewables agenda often misunderstand the core problem. Cutting subsidies alone will not lower prices. As Octopus Energy and E.ON told Parliament’s Energy Security and Net Zero Committee, even if gas prices halved or fell to zero, electricity bills would still rise. But why? The reason lies in so-called ‘non-commodity costs’ – the cost of managing a grid rather than of generating the power. Because renewables are weather-dependent, spatially diffuse, and often located far from where power is needed, and moreover because they undermine the economics of the gas-fired fleet – vital for when the wind is not blowing – these costs are soaring. Energy experts, including Professors Dieter Helm and Gordon Hughes, have argued that such system costs are now the main driver of bills and – unlike with thermal power systems – will keep rising as more renewables are added. Cancelling subsidies might bring short-term relief, but, as long as intermittent generation grows, balancing and capacity market costs will escalate. Britain cannot reduce the cost of living, revive productivity, or restore economic growth without fixing its electricity system. To do this, UK politicians must confront not only subsidies, but the physical and contractual structures that make energy permanently expensive.” Energy consultant Kathryn Porter had a similar, grim question “How do we keep the lights on with 12 GW net firm capacity at risk of retirement by 2030?” in a speech to the Institution of Power Engineers. Paul Homewood summarizes key points with: “A total of 56 GW, facing peak winter demand of 48 GW. That capacity cannot be guaranteed 24/7, so 50 GW is more realistic. Moreover that 7 GW of batteries, plus 2.7 GW of pumped storage can only supply for an hour or so – enough to meet peak demand, but worthless for longer periods. As a result, we are already totally dependent on imported power at the times when wind power cannot meet demand. But the real value of Kathryn’s analysis is that she has identified how much gas power capacity we could potentially lose in the next few years. Not only is 12 GW at risk of closure by 2030, but another 6 GW could go by 2035.” See links under Questioning European Green. ********************* Literacy Through Censorship: The 30th Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) concluded November 21, a new threat has emerged to modern civilization – UN censorship. Jo Nova links to a November 12 UN press release that states: “The Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change today launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, establishing shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues. The Declaration commits signatories to promote the integrity of information related to climate change at international, national, and local levels, in line with international human rights law and the principles of the Paris Agreement. Drafted in collaboration with civil society members of the Global Initiative Advisory Group, the Declaration has been endorsed by ten countries so far – Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, and Uruguay. ‘Climate change is no longer a threat of the future; it is a tragedy of the present,’ said President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Belém. ‘We live in an era in which obscurantists reject scientific evidence and attack institutions. It is time to deliver yet another defeat to denialism.’” Charles Rotter has additional views on the subsequent: “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change.” See links under Censorship. ********************* Number of the Week: ~4.5 mm/year v. 1-2 mm/year. A paper in Nature Communications, Earth & Environment states: Over the past three decades, satellites have provided continuous, accurate measurements of sea level on near-global scales. Here, we show that since satellites began observing sea surface heights in 1993 until the end of 2023, global mean sea level has risen by 111 mm. In addition, the rate of global mean sea level rise over those three decades has increased from ~2.1 mm/year in 1993 to ~4.5 mm/year in 2023. If this trajectory of sea level rise continues over the next three decades, sea levels will increase by an additional 169 mm globally, comparable to mid-range sea level projections from the IPCC AR6. The reported satellite estimates are inconsistent with tidal gauge measurements taken at geological stable locations. Ole Humlum reports: “Tide gauges along coasts indicate a typical global sea level increase of about 1-2 mm/yr. Coastal sea level change rate last 100 year has essentially been stable, but with periodic variations.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science.

Problems in the Orthodoxy Are climate-obsessed elites losing their grip over global politics? Bill Gates appears to be spearheading a new push towards a Malthusian ‘One Health’ agenda instead of global temperature concerns amid a sudden shift in the climate change narrative. By James Corbett, Lifesite, Nov 18, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Overheating no longer cool By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Zeke Hausfather was until recently a reliable media go-to for doom-and-gloom climate quotations who posted stuff like “This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist – absolutely gobsmackingly bananas”, and wrote stuff like: “the further we push the climate beyond where it has been for the past few million years, the greater and more unpredictable the risks become.” But now he sneers at such flimflam… Warmists Feel a Growing Chill By Tony Thomas, Climate Scepticism, Nov 19, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] The modelers’ outputs “run hot”, with forecasts well exceeding actual warming for the past two decades. And the long-term scenarios to which models’ forecasts are tailored are also fanciful, though that doesn’t stop them being extolled by tens of thousands of academic researchers. Models v. Observations New satellite study reveals a widespread transition zone in the sky, challenging climate models By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Nov 18, 2025 Link to paper: Global Assessment of the Cloud-Aerosol Transition Zone Using CALIPSO By Jaume Ruiz de Morales, et al., Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, Nov 17, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Discussed in last week’s TWTW, Anthony Sadar brought up that climate models fail to capture divergence of the layers in the atmosphere.] Changing Weather Heatwaves in a net zero World By Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, et al., Environmental Research, Nov 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: We address this by examining heatwave projections from millennial-scale simulations run with the Australian Earth System Model, ACCESS-ESM1-5.

Torrential rains return to Southern California, prompting flash flood warnings before moving east By AP, The Hill, Nov 21, 2025 Is Rainfall In Wales More Extreme? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 18, 2025 See two links immediately below Monmouth Floods–Then & Now By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 21, 2025 [SEPP Comment: A history of flooding, alleviated by dredging.] Storm Claudia By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 21, 2025 Monmouth (Wales) has always been particularly vulnerable to flooding, because it sits at the confluence of three rivers, the Wye, Monnow, and Trothy. Its history is littered with floods every bit as bad as this week’s. It might seem a daft place to build a town, but the Normans built the castle and town specifically because of those three rivers, allowing them to exert control over the river crossings. Since then, it continued to thrive because of its communication links. #HaveItBothWays: Drought in the UK By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Whether the UK gets wetter or drier in the future, you can rest assured that climate science predicted it and you’re to blame either way.

Lowering Standards The BBC: My Part In Its Downfall By Iain Macwhirter, The Daily Sceptic, Nov 14, 2025 As critical friends like the former BBC politics presenter Andrew Marr and the former defence correspondent Mark Urban have pointed out, there is now a generation of activist-minded graduates running BBC programs who think that they should, like broadcasters in wartime, be taking sides. They think the BBC should be promoting social justice, opposing environmental catastrophe and depriving anti-immigrant populists of the oxygen of publicity. Only they cannot do this and still be the BBC proper. Iain Macwhirter, a former BBC political correspondent and TV presenter, is a columnist for the Times and the author of Disunited Kingdom. Oh heh heh that transition By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 The International Energy Agency [IEA], which does seem to have become the International Anti-Energy Agency recently, has the good grace to admit that zealotry had overwhelmed judgement. Well, they didn’t put it that way. EXCLUSIVE: New Freedom of Information Request and the UK Met Office has to Rewrite its Temperature Explanations Again By Chris Morrison, The Daily Sceptic, Nov 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] The UK Met Office’s excuses for its invented temperature data from non-existent stations get more fanciful by the day. Explanation after explanation fails to live up to rigorous examination, with statutory Freedom of Information (FOI) requests leading to frequent rewriting and new things to believe before breakfast. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? Drought Misinformation By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Nov 18, 2025 They took a picture of one of the lake flanks, which is always dry during this season—even during a normal year.

From Eschenbach: If you want to monitor the AMOC, measure it directly. Don’t use proxy tea leaves from a noisy, complex region, filtered through biased models, and call it a “superior fingerprint.” Climate Scientists Claim That Global Warming Is Going To Cause A New Ice Age? By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Nov 18, 2025 [H/t S.J. Cvrk] One thing that is true is that global cooling would be more dangerous to the Earth than global warming. The most recent Ice Age was a devastating event that is projected to have killed up to 150,000 non-microbe species. On a grand scale of Earth-time, we have barely exited that disaster which ended 11,000 years ago. When Climate Modeling Becomes Climate Mythmaking: “Sea-Level Rise Causes More Cold Snaps” By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Nov 15, 2025 Link to paper: Intensification of extreme cold events in East Asia in response to global mean sea-level rise By Caoyi Dong, Nature Communications, Sep 30, 2025 From Rotter: The paper reveals that each simulation is run for 2200 model years: “All experiments were run for 2200 model years, with analyses focusing on the last 200 years of the model output.” One can appreciate the computational commitment, but the physical justification is less clear.

By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Nov 15, 2025 So, they have actually calculated that the attempt to reach “net zero” emissions on the statutorily-mandated schedule will cost consumers an extra $42 billion per year by 2040. They don’t give us numbers for other years, but presumably other years would be comparable. So, figure, $42 billion per year. Let’s say that that is slightly different from wind and solar being “cheaper” than our existing fossil fuel infrastructure. The true source of civilization’s future is energy wisdom By Ronald Stein, Armando Cavanha, & Yoshihiro Muronaka, America Out Loud News, Nov 17, 2025 For an engineer, the distinction between efficiency and saving is fundamental. Efficiency is a design challenge: achieving a task with the minimum input through better engineering. Saving, on the other hand, is often a behavioral practice: using less through habit or restraint. Non-Green Jobs Wirtschaftlicher Selbstmord [Economic Suicide] By Willis Eschenbach, WUWT, Nov 20, 2025 Adjusted for population size, that’s as if in six months every single factory worker in North Carolina lost their job. The Germans thought they could run a post-industrial society on hope, regulations, and a few clouds of solar panels—but you can’t repeal the laws of economics, any more than you can run a steel mill on good intentions. Now the bill is coming due. Funding Issues An unhealthy fixation By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 It is to some people, apparently. The same ones who think it’s all fun and games for some otherwise undistinguished politician to redo the Industrial Revolution and get it better this time… until someone loses a pension fund. The Political Games Continue A momentary outbreak of sensibleness in Australia By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Nov 21, 2025 A new day dawns Downunder For the first time in years, the Opposition doesn’t sound like a schoolgirl (well, not all the time). And, suddenly the government has realized they shouldn’t go burning $2 billion on a COP31 All of this pain has achieved nothing. When the Coalition left office, emissions were 28 per cent below 2005 levels. Today they are just 28.7 per cent below 2005 levels. Labor talks tough on climate but has delivered virtually no emissions reductions and higher costs. This is abject policy failure.

There is only one answer to the problem of looming blackouts – begin immediately on a large-scale rollout of new CCGT power stations. If we do that, of course, there is no economic value in building any further wind and solar capacity, so AR7 and future CfD rounds need to be cancelled.

They’ve sent a Special Rapporteur, Astrid Puentes Riano, to join three cases in Federal Courts in an amicus curiae role. She is here to cast a spell and see if she gets lucky and scores some shake-down-money in reparations. It was only a few months ago the International Court of Climate Justice (ICJ) declared that nice weather was a “human right”, thus supposedly allowing the whole world to sue everyone else, ad infinitum for bad weather. Energy Issues — US Rising Electricity Prices: The Missing Link By Jonathan Lesser, Real Clear Energy, Nov 20, 2025 The reality is that many factors are contributing to rising electricity rates, especially the rapid increases that households and businesses have experienced over the last five years. But the various studies have overlooked a key factor: the changing mix of generating resources, as traditional fossil fuel and nuclear plants have been replaced by wind and solar ones. When Energy Is Done Right, a Rising Tide Will Lift All Boats By Gary Abernathy, Real Clear Energy, Nov 18, 2025 As China launches an AI Manhattan Project, US AI Support is buckling under High Energy Prices By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 Developing the technology alone is not enough. The USA didn’t start the current AI push. The University of Toronto developed the critical breakthrough which made the current AI revolution possible in 2012. But aside from some Canadian islands of research excellence, Canada is not a serious player in the AI race. Canada’s obsession with green energy and moribund economy gave the USA the edge – an edge the USA is now in danger of losing to China.

It would replace a Biden administration-era plan that proposed just three offshore lease sales, all in the Gulf of Mexico, between the years 2024 and 2029. Nuclear Energy and Fears A Nuclear Resurgence, But Major Obstacles Remain By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, Nov 20, 2025 Artificial intelligence needs 24-hour, 7-day, always-on power, which intermittent wind and solar can’t provide.

The future of solar now depends on innovation, transparency, and adaptability to thrive no matter what policies are put in our way. Renewable energy is cheaper and healthier – so why isn’t it replacing fossil fuels faster? By Jay Gulledge, The Conversation, Nov 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] A decade ago, the cheapest way to meet growing demand for electricity was to build more coal or natural gas power plants. Not anymore. Solar and wind power aren’t just better for the climate; they’re also less expensive today than fossil fuels at utility scale, and they’re less harmful to people’s health. Yet renewable energy projects face headwinds, including in the world’s fast-growing developing countries. I study energy and climate solutions and their impact on society, and I see ways to overcome those challenges and expand renewable energy – but it will require international cooperation.

What do Americans die from, and what do the New York Times, Washington Post, and Fox News report on? By Hannah Ritchie, Tuna Acisu, and Edouard Mathieu, Our World in Data, Oct 6, 2025 From Dinerstein: The data exposes a sobering truth: the media landscape no longer reflects the statistical reality of the world but the emotional reality of what captures attention. Headlines reflect not the greatest dangers to our lives, but the strongest reactions of our hearts When the media amplifies the rare and sensational, it warps our collective sense of risk, steering fear and policy toward the exceptional instead of the everyday. From Hype to Evidence: Rethinking Microplastic Pollution in Our Foods By Chuck Dinerstein, MD, ACSH, Nov 17, 2025 Public concern about microplastics has grown rapidly—often outpacing the evidence. The European Food Safety Agency’s comprehensive review shows that while microplastics can indeed be released from food contact materials, the quantities are far lower than many early studies suggested, and most data on nanoplastics are still unreliable or missing altogether. Much of the apparent risk has been amplified by inconsistent testing methods, contamination, and the misidentification of non-plastic residues as plastic particles. This does not mean we should dismiss the issue. It means we should keep it in proportion. The science to date tells us that microplastic release from everyday packaging is a real but limited phenomenon, not a looming public health crisis. A healthy dose of reality By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 19, 2025 Like those at the Globe & Mail who just wrote “For the health of Canadians, the health care sector must decarbonize now”. Right, that’s the priority. Millions of Canadians have no family doctor, and the population faces some of the world’s longest waits for essential surgeries. Other News that May Be of Interest The Congressional Minerals Mandate By Rich Nolan, Real Clear Energy, Nov 17, 2025 Why the chemtrail conspiracy theory lingers and grows – and why Tucker Carlson is talking about it By Calum Lister Matheson, The Conversation, Nov 14, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Conspiracies are dramatic and exciting, with clear lines of good and evil, whereas real life is boring and sometimes scary. The chemtrail theory is ultimately prideful. It’s a way for theorists to feel powerful and smart when they face things beyond their comprehension and control. Conspiracy theories come and go but responding to them in the long-term means finding better ways to embrace uncertainty, ambiguity and our own limits alongside a new embrace of the tools we do have; logic, evidence and even humility. BELOW THE BOTTOM LINE Satellite-Borne Mirrors Would Light Up the Skies at Night to Boost Solar Power By Bonner Russell Cohen, Real Clear Energy, Nov 19, 2025 The orbital dynamics of rapidly moving satellites — orbiting the Earth at a speed of 4.7 miles per second — further undermine the efficiency of “sunlight on demand.” “To a static location on the ground, as computed by astronomers Michael J. I. Brown and Matt Kenworthy, that means each satellite will be within 1000 km [621 miles] of a given location on the ground for no more than 210 seconds (or 3.5 minutes) per orbit,” Siegel adds. “And you’d need thousands of them, all reflecting sunlight to the same location on the ground, to generate any power at all.” COP30 On Fire!

They say clean energy isn’t just a climate issue, it’s a public health one. Friday Funny: COPs 1-30 – A perfect record of failure By Anthony Watts, WUWT, Nov 21, 2025 ARTICLES NO ARTICLES THIS WEEK Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe “Yes, but this was obvious long before the first models were created. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and thus the more of it added to the atmosphere, the higher surface temperature should rise.” Conclusion by inference. About as basic a violation of the scientific method as is possible, Sorry David, but in Immediately conceding the central ground of the dispute, the plot has been lost Some here may not forgive me the analogy, but what was done here is as though an atheist in a dispute began with, ‘yeah, the bible is true, but …’ One should study David Dibbell’s video showing the ERA5 Reanalysis Energy Conversion in the Atmosphere, to gain the critical view of increased carbon dioxide. Spoiler alert: the energetic impact of all emitted CO2 is about 10% of the width of the zero-tick, in a energy-dynamic traversing (+/-)10,000 W/m^2. The climatological effect of CO2 is revealed to be indistinguishable from zero. And climate model uncertainty? The physical theory deployed in climate models is critically deficient. A model tuned to speciously reproduce a warming trend will successfully extrapolate the future trend so long as the trend continues. Empirical extrapolations are not predictions in any scientific sense. As Chris Essex long ago noted, tuned parameters are ad hoc conservation laws that have no basis in physics. They impose climate stasis. Ad hoc laws and deficient theory make both simulations of future climate and air temperature projections themselves physically meaningless, no matter model statistical skill in extrapolation. The models are utterly unreliable – a fact already known. Pace David, but in hard ball, one doesn’t concede a home run. Thanks, Pat – I had the exact same issue with Dave’s analysis of ‘Forecast number 1’ last week: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/11/19/just-how-good-were-the-early-climate-models/#comment-4133138 Thanks right back, Frank. So far as I can see, your view is dead-on. But the article asserts that early climate model forecasts about global warming were correct decades before the forecasts could be evaluated. That is much like claiming that a Volkswagen has an acceleration identical to a Ferrari. It is a qualitative assessment recognizing that both can gain speed over time, but purposely ignores that the quantitative increases over time are very dissimilar. Qualitatively, they share a positive slope; however, quantitatively the accelerations are very different. Alarmists commonly wave their arms around to attract attention, but then fail to provide measurements to support their claims. It is said that mathematics is the language of science. Innumerate claims supported only by poorly-defined ‘lawyer words’ demonstrate that the claims are not supported by science. Something cannot be right and wrong at the same time. One or the other must be right, not both at the same time. The defining characteristic of a change like warming is the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time, which is the instantaneous change defined as the slope or the tangent to the temperature function at a particular time. I would submit that “early climate model forecasts” were not correct. Some were so wrong quantitatively as to be absurd. To claim that they all were correct suggests that those making such a claim never took a calculus class. The collection of early forecasts, all being quite different, serves to prove that nobody knew what they were talking about, even as late as 1988 when Hansen produced several different scenarios, all giving different results based on different assumptions. The only conclusion justified by the qualitative claims is that Earth has been warming for about 20,000 years and will probably continue to for at least a similar length of time. However, quantitatively, warming 1 degree C over the next century is not the same as warming 10 or 20 degrees in the same amount of time. It is sophistry to suggest that they are the same. Xeno’s Paradox has similarly been proven to be illogical by calculus. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Title: Let the dancing begin, Pope Alexios (the Infallible), his poor comrades, the Left’s vaudeville, the shop windows and the media

Full Content:
Hello, today we have a journalistic celebration because, whichever way you look at it, we realized from our leader Alexis’ book, which has just come out piping hot, that in the end God does exist and of course so does the Virgin Mary. Apart from the fact that even Tsipras invoked Him in difficult moments (in Mati), we also understood it ourselves from the way we survived after the SYRIZA five-year period. So what the wise people say — “Holy Mary, help” and “God protect us” — somehow… exists, hidden as a wish deep in time, and perhaps it even holds true. To be honest with you, I leafed through the book Ithaca and I’m conveying to you whatever I understood subjectively. Tsipras, it is certain, did not write this book to apologize for anything, or almost anything. If one considers that the pivotal point of his term was the referendum, the negotiation, and its outcome — yet another memorandum worth 80–100 billion euros — for this Tsipras does not seem to repent at all. On the contrary, he considers it the correct political move which benefited the country. Meaning that if you asked him today whether he would do it again, or whether he would “take” the alternative solution the Europeans were offering him from the spring of 2015, he would obviously answer in the affirmative. Nor did I read him admitting mistakes in other critical issues, except for Zoe and Varoufakis, with whom, however, he untangled things early, since the summer of 2015. The one he utterly humiliates, clearly intentionally, is poor Kasselakis, although he does not accept that he “foisted” him onto SYRIZA. And really, if you sit and write that Tyler was asking Betty how they would raise his children with Stefanos when they go to the Maximos Mansion… you understand! Novartis-families Generally speaking I didn’t see him admit to having made a mistake, not even in the historical Novartis frame-up. There he says that “we shouldn’t have taken politicians to their natural judge but to a Preliminary Committee,” as if the Justice system were more controlled compared to the parliamentary majority he fully controlled. Even in his… attempt to make a supposed self-critique about the constant attacks on Mitsotakis’ family, he gives a completely ridiculous explanation regarding his wife, Mareva. Mitsotakis, he says, swept us away into mistakes with his communication mechanisms, resulting in “a state of siege and under the sway of anger, we adopted a tactic of highlighting scandals that concerned not only Mitsotakis but also the business activity of his wife…”. The truth of course is that he cultivated an entire media system to attack families, journalists, political opponents, etc., from the first to the last day of his term. These things of course sometimes go wrong in life — not to say almost always — and today his opponents will be enjoying his misfortunes with popcorn. Small first conclusion Nevertheless the book is very interesting because it is living history, and it will be read whether it enrages you or makes you happy because you are on the Left and nostalgically remember how lovely things were with Dritsas, Tasia, Filis, Zoe in her… right mind, and the rest of the crazy gang who brought us one step before the drachma. The book will get enormous publicity, it will raise limitless dust and disputes on both sides. It will… inevitably also assist the deeply wounded relationship of Samaras with ND, and ultimately it will benefit — gift, once again — Mitsotakis. And lastly: newspapers and shop windows Naturally I will return more analytically after I study the leader’s book, but I want to close today’s commentary with something I read that touches me in the job I’ve done for 40 years. Tsipras recounts his famous meeting with Psycharis in a mutual friend’s house, shortly before taking power. The late Stavros, after starting off with the theory that they had to come to an understanding because DOL always belonged to the… Democratic Camp, told him that at that time (DOL) was facing major financial problems, obviously implying that the new SYRIZA regime could help them. Then Tsipras, according to his own narrative, countered that they (DOL) were politically attacking them, etc. And Psycharis replied with the line: “Look, Alexis… newspapers are like shop-window displays. One time they have summer clothes, one time winter clothes. The shop is the same. The display changes.” What Psycharis told him — in truth, in a very digestible and vivid way — was, is, and I think will be the norm between power and the media, regardless of whether the (transaction) did not flourish at the time. With exceptions, of course, that stand out… Cabinet meeting The Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday was moved to Wednesday afternoon, as the funeral of Nikos Hardalias’ father intervenes. It has several items, from Justice issues regarding inheritances and Environmental provisions concerning spatial planning, and generally K.M. will give the final guidelines to the ministers for the year’s end. A party with a pulse There may not have been many local derbies in ND’s Prefectural and Local Organizations, but Piraeus headquarters mobilized strongly yesterday and counted its members ahead of the elections. The mechanism warmed up a bit; 122,000 people entered the process to pay and register, and indeed at a time when internal party matters are not at their peak. What they retain in ND is that the mechanism showed vital signs ahead of the congress to be held after Easter and of course ahead of the elections. Not to mention that the numbers for ND’s Prefectural elections are larger than the internal elections for the Presidency in other parties. Geopolitical stress tests are coming to the banks The SSM is attempting a closer approach regarding geopolitical risks for European banks. And because measurements in this case cannot be precise, it is virtually impossible for corresponding forecasts to be made. They would cost billions anyway. But although the approach seems somewhat lighter, in the end it becomes an additional headache for the banks. As far as our country is concerned, even without being in a red-hot zone, it constitutes a geopolitical area of increased priority for supervisors. Thus supervision is insistently asking Greek banks as well to “stress” similar data in the exercises they conduct, such as ICAAP for example, which is the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. This is an internal procedure banks apply to assess how resilient they are to adverse scenarios and how effective their risk-management processes are. To prove the point, JP Morgan’s Managing Director Kian Abouhossein raised the issue on Friday at the firm’s London road show, “interrogating” Pedro Machado, member of the ECB Supervisory Board. And he, among other things, answered that the thematic stress test for banks in 2026 will be an “inverse” exercise evaluating geopolitical-risk scenarios separately for each bank and their potential impact on each bank’s solvency. After all, this is the first priority of the SSM for the period 2026-2028: how banks will continue to strengthen their financial resilience in the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Overall, discussions with banks, as he said, regarding the management of geopolitical risks continue and include the whole range: identifying these risks and of course taking the necessary actions to make banks more resilient to precisely these conditions. Signatures within the week for Ethniki Insurance The transaction for Ethniki Insurance is expected to be completed within the week. This means that the final signatures will be placed so that Piraeus Bank acquires 100% of the insurance company. And since the “what comes next” is always interesting, developments in the insurance scene around the country’s leading insurance company are expected. It is considered almost certain that sooner or later Ethniki Insurance will cooperate exclusively with its new shareholder. The above developments themselves set in motion the corresponding moves by National Bank to find a new insurance partner. Signing the agreement this week sets a milestone in that direction. The evolution at the level of bancassurance for all parties involved will become known in 2026. The ECB asks for more capital buffers from Revolut The SSM released the results of the stress test on Pillar 2 capital buffer requirements for all major European banks, and the Greek ones have among the lowest requirements, below 3%. National Bank at 2.50%, Eurobank at 2.75%, Piraeus and Alpha at 2.90%. The requirements relate to how banks operate, how they comply with SSM rules and controls. The logic is that those who do not comply are more vulnerable and therefore more capital requirements are imposed on them. There were also banks that saw an increase in their Pillar 2 required capital, such as Revolut, which became a systemic bank last year, but for next year its Pillar 2 capital requirement increased by 80 basis points to 4.50%, the highest among the 105 banks. Turnover party today at the Stock Exchange It is not unlikely that the value of transactions in today’s stock-market session will reach even 1 billion euros, due to the MSCI index rebalancing. We will have an explosive increase in turnover in the Metlen Energy & Metals stock, which is leaving the MSCI Greece Standard to join MSCI Europe, and in addition we have the entry of Viohalco and Cenergy Holdings into the Small Cap. The game professionals have played lately was classic: pressure on the stocks that are leaving MSCI until the rebalancing is completed, and an upward push on the stocks entering the MSCI indices so they are bought at high prices on rebalancing day. All this in a market that is yielding three times more than any other European market (General Index +40.28%, Banking Index +79.67%, FTSE 25 +46.08%) and with heavyweight stocks (e.g. Alpha Bank +123%, Piraeus +82%, National Bank +70%) that are flooding foreign investors’ portfolios with profits as they close out for 2025, right after Black Friday. AKTOR Group ready for a retail bond The AKTOR Group is preparing to issue a series of bonds worth 200 million euros, with a five-year duration, in order to borrow from savers at an interest rate close to 4%. At the beginning of the year, AKTOR had completed a 200-million-euro share capital increase, which was oversubscribed, to finance investments amounting to 2 billion euros. AKTOR is closely observing the success of retail bonds in the Greek market, especially after Greece’s upgrade to investment grade. The 4% for a five-year horizon for a group with a backlog that will reach 6 billion in 2025 sounds attractive. Over the past month, AKTOR Group’s stock has gained more than 11%, and its market capitalization is moving towards the target of 2 billion euros (today €1.89 billion). The difficult equation of the capital increase at ADMIE Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ recent reference from Singapore to the possibility of a capital increase at ADMIE confirms the activity surrounding the capital reinforcement of the operator. The aim is to ensure funding for the large ten-year development program worth 6 billion euros without losing state control, with the state retaining its statutory minority, meaning it must remain at 34%. The government team is fully aware that the ambitious grid interconnection program of the coming years—almost 6 billion euros—cannot move forward solely with own funds and European resources. The entry of new investors is now considered the only way, provided that public control is not undermined. In the background, American pressure appears to play a decisive role in the shareholding developments. Diplomatic sources report that Washington and Athens have repeatedly discussed reducing Chinese influence over energy infrastructure. And it is no coincidence that among the contenders for ADMIE (besides Italian TERNA, which had been mentioned in the past), BlackRock has recently appeared, with market observers speaking of “multi-layered American activity.” Opposite these dynamics stands the Chinese giant State Grid, which with its 24% stake and enhanced rights acquired in 2017 remains a key factor. Sources familiar with the discussions claim that the Chinese do not desire conflict but request a “clear picture” of what the new shareholding structure will entail. The high quorum required for the capital increase essentially makes their consent necessary. According to information, the Maximos Mansion seeks to complete the process within the new year so that the investment momentum is not lost and uncertainty in the markets is not prolonged. The question is whether a formula can be achieved that keeps the State above 34%, brings in the American capital sought by the allies, and leaves China without reason to react. The backstage chatter says that a solution exists but requires delicate handling. The Sarantis era in Ioannina The new era of Hellenic Dairies at Dodoni formally begins. After the approval of the deal by the Competition Commission, the acquisition was completed, and already since last Friday the company’s board was radically reshaped. Thus, Chairman of the Ioannina dairy industry becomes Stelios Sarantis, son of Michalis; CEO is Giorgos Sarantis, son of Takis; Vice-Chairman and head of market supervision matters is Mr. Athanasoulas Georgios; and Deputy CEO is Mr. Konstantinos Chytas. Mr. Vlachos Nikolaos also participates in the board as a member. According to the Sarantis brothers, Dodoni’s integration into the Hellenic Dairies group will be accompanied by a series of investments. We shall see… “Byzantino” returns to The Ilisian A new gastronomic arrival—marking the first “opening” of the new destination to the general public—is in its final stage, namely the Japanese restaurant at “The Ilisian,” at the former Hilton Athens which closed in January 2022. The new restaurant, expected to become the city’s new gastronomic hotspot ahead of Christmas, has its entrance on Michalakopoulou Street, is housed in the new extension built onto the iconic property, and will overlook the impressive indoor pool of the new destination. At “The Ilisian,” the private members-only House of NYNN club has been operating since the summer, but now the destination is gradually opening to everyone—Athenians and visitors—as part of the major investment being carried out in the former Hilton building by the Konstantakopoulos–Olayan duo. The Japanese restaurant, with its impressive marble entrance on Michalakopoulou, is the first of the nine dining venues that “The Ilisian” will host, expected to open before the new year. From 2026 onward, the remaining venues will gradually follow: The emblematic Galaxy Bar on the top floor will be reintroduced as “The Galaxy Dispensary,” with a large collection of wines and premium spirits, and next to it “The Galaxy Supper Club,” a luxurious space that will elevate haute cuisine in Athens. Similarly, the “Byzantino” restaurant—a constant value from the past—will return in 2026 with a renewed appearance, while a Lounge Café Bar will operate from early morning until late at night in the hotel lobby. Optimism for 2026 early bookings Based on early bookings for the 2026 season, Greek tourism appears to be moving positively, although—according to many in the sector last weekend at Xenia—it is currently running on “autopilot.” Nearly 85% of hotels, which are small and medium-sized businesses, “cannot secure financing, and access to capital is the exception,” said Giannis Chatzis, president of the Hellenic Hoteliers Federation, during the 13th general assembly of the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels last Saturday. Tourism stakeholders are awaiting on Wednesday the Ministry of Tourism’s event for the sector, attended also by the Prime Minister, and whether Kyriakos Mitsotakis will make announcements. Note that according to data from the Bank of Greece announced last Friday regarding the travel balance, even though September “slowed down” compared to last year—with 3.42 billion euros in revenue this year versus 3.55 billion last year during the same month—the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion euros for the first time, specifically reaching 20.13 billion euros, up 9% compared to the 18.47 billion in the January–September 2024 period. Wall Street is tightening for shipping companies The latest developments on Wall Street for shipping companies show that the game is changing—and in a way that resembles a silent shift rather than a dramatic maneuver. At the annual Marine Money Ship Finance Forum, the message was clear: the market for listed shipping companies in the U.S. has shrunk by nearly half over a decade, the result of a dual “cut” from mergers and privatizations. And even if the framework seems strictly technocratic, the essence is simple: companies that remain public have two choices—either grow or leave the exchange. The pressure stems not only from low valuations or compliance costs, but also from the fact that institutional investors are looking elsewhere. With less appetite for smaller shipping firms, well-established family-owned groups often choose to depart and return to the safety of private equity. Yet, even as the American market “tightens,” Greek shipping continues to maintain a notable presence with 31 listed companies. This is not only a matter of numbers but of stability in a market that is becoming increasingly selective. Greek shipowners, through smaller listings or larger structures, maintain their footprint, consistently seizing opportunities in public markets. At the same time, the major players who remain listed—especially in the tanker sector—now function as the “flagships” of Wall Street: large market caps, high liquidity, and greater support from the investment community. It is an environment where scale becomes a strategic advantage and where, in the future, we may see only a few strong players per sector. Aramco, the Americans, and Greece in the background Aramco’s recent moves in the U.S. are not simply business announcements; they indicate that the energy game around LNG is entering a new phase, with implications stretching from the Gulf to the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. Aramco, traditionally oil-focused, has begun systematically expanding its presence in natural gas, signing agreements with American producers such as MidOcean (Lake Charles LNG) and Commonwealth LNG in Louisiana. These are projects totaling more than 25 mtpa, a scale capable of influencing future power dynamics in the global LNG market. Saudi Arabia is attempting to diversify its energy identity at a time when Europe and Asia seek stable LNG suppliers following the disruption caused by the war in Ukraine. With more than 200 mtpa of new projects entering the market by 2030, whoever locks in strategic positions now will determine the future rules of the game. Moreover, strengthening U.S. production through foreign investment boosts America’s role as an energy superpower. This carries political weight in the Middle East, where Washington wants to maintain influence, and in the Eastern Mediterranean, where energy developments (Cyprus, Israel, Egypt) are at a critical point. And it opens a cycle of competition and opportunity for countries like Greece, which sees LNG taking a central role in its infrastructure—from Alexandroupoli to Revithoussa—making it a hub for flows toward the Balkans. Aristides and the… Pittas Fund While the major players in containerships worry about the orderbook-mountain coming toward 2027, Aristides Pittas seems to be following a different strategy — one Wall Street describes with a single phrase: “locking in the upside before the music stops.” In the last quarter, the head of the U.S.-listed Euroseas did something reminiscent of a hedge fund manager in “protect the portfolio from any possible storm” mode. Four newbuild vessels that haven’t even hit the water yet secured four-year charters at $35,500 per day, and a fifth one, already at sea, locked in close to $33,500. Some in New York would call it “building my yield before the correction begins.” He believes the big wave of new capacity will pressure the mega-ships, but not the feeder containerships. In other words, he is positioning himself in a segment that is shrinking — therefore becoming increasingly scarce and, consequently, more profitable for those who already have exposure there. At the brokers’ tables, people comment that Pittas “closed his 2026 books before they even opened.” With already 70% coverage of the 2026 operating days, the model looks more like a tech company locking in recurring revenue than a classic shipping company playing spot-to-spot. The best quarter for HELEX and Bouzna’s plans This afternoon, after the close of the session, HELEX will announce its Q3 results. Information converges toward the estimate that net profit for the third quarter will easily exceed €8 million — making this HELEX’s best quarter in the past 12 years. The HELEX share, at €5.96, trades at a discount of about -8% relative to its now-parent company, Euronext. For his part, Stéphane Bouzna has been giving interviews to international media in recent days, explaining Euronext’s broader plan. Of particular interest was his interview with CNBC, where — after praising the reform momentum of the Greek economy and reiterating plans to create a new technology and support hub in Athens now that the Athens Stock Exchange will migrate to Euronext’s advanced Optiq trading platform — he spoke about the broader strategy. Euronext is ready to contribute to the next level of market integration in Europe, creating a deeper liquidity pool for financing European entrepreneurship. He spoke about his contacts with the London Stock Exchange but did not hide that he also held discussions with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, explaining that it would be interesting for Deutsche Börse if it were willing to sell — in response to Chancellor Merz’s call for the creation of a pan-European stock exchange. The Trojan horse of… socialism in… golden California In California, 200 billionaires have been counted, with combined wealth estimated at $2 trillion.California’s budget is on the edge of a cliff, especially after President Trump’s federal government decision to cut healthcare spending by at least $30 billion. Suddenly, someone threw out the idea: Let’s impose an extraordinary one-off 5% levy on the wealth of California’s 200 billionaires so we can all live better. The Medicaid cuts threaten 145,000 jobs in the healthcare sector. The truth is that today, 1% of California taxpayers pay over 40% of the state’s income taxes. If yet another — “extraordinary, but who can be sure?” — 5% tax is imposed, how will the 200 billionaires react? Some will choose relocation to “friendlier” states such as Florida, Texas, or Nevada. Others will transfer ownership rights to trusts or offshore structures. Some will suspend planned investments in California, and others will reduce philanthropic and institutional funding. Triggered by the victory of the “socialist” Mamdani in New York, the debate is hot on California’s TV networks. The proposal faces constitutional obstacles, while previous similar initiatives were abandoned. California governor Gavin Newsom strongly opposes it. The healthcare workers’ union ignores him and pushes the vote forward. Ray Dalio no longer believes in bitcoin Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, gave an interview to CNBC and revealed that he now holds only 1% of his portfolio in bitcoin. It is a position that resembles more a safety valve than an investment conviction. Dalio argued that bitcoin will never become a reserve currency for major countries because, after spectacular developments in quantum computing, the cryptocurrency can be detected, controlled, and — most importantly — compromised. That’s why Dalio again believes in gold. The truth is that in the past Dalio said quite the opposite about bitcoin (“it has proven its value… it hasn’t been hacked… it has stood the test of time”). But now that bitcoin’s exchange rate is collapsing, and after Google’s presentation of its quantum supercomputer, Dalio’s stance has changed dramatically… Yesterday, the bitcoin price had plunged to as low as $84,600 before recovering later above $86,700.

Title: Irish designer Rashhiiid: ‘My hats are talking points now – these things make me happy’

It all began with a hat, handmade from fake fur with a silk lining. Rachel Maguire was in her final year studying fashion at the Grafton Academy when she decided to make “one big bold hat” during Covid, and was taken aback when suddenly everyone who saw her wearing it wanted one too. “I felt it expressed me and made me feel better, and was a way of coming through Covid. People broke the two-metre rule to touch it. My hats are talking points now – these things make me happy, so I want to make other people feel empowered through my clothing,” she says when we meet in Blackrock in Dublin, a few weeks after her thrilling debut show in the Douglas Hyde Gallery. In the four years since she launched her label Rashhiiid (the name comes from a childhood nickname), Maguire, who is now 27, has shown extraordinary resilience and determination, demonstrating how a wild imagination can create desirable clothing. Her designs – expressive, zany and often daring – have attracted the attention of superstars like Doja Cat, who has endorsed not just her hats, but her coats and bags too, and commissioned a custom-made denim outfit. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion wore her faux Mongolian lamb boot covers performing in Boston. Her floor-length fake fur bubble coats in bright blue or pink are similar scene stealers. Her hats, her best sellers, continue to make statements. With titles like Grand Dollar Bill, Tower of Fantasy, Silver Bucket or Rainbow Racoon, they form dramatic furry frames around the face. Last year she moved to Paris, bought the best industrial sewing machine she could find, and along with two Irish interns in her studio, she completed orders, “working and doing photo shoots”, with a French PR company helping with promotion. In August, when Paris shut down, she took off for Guangzhou in China, a key area in textile manufacturing, checked into a three-star hotel in the city. “I spent the whole month there – no one spoke English, there was no internet, but I found a family-run factory making for luxury European brands that was good quality. I was lonely, with noodles for breakfast every day, and I was sewing from Monday to Sunday through the week to create my own custom pieces from fabrics I could source there. It was a dream come true.” The long grey/green dress she is wearing from her new collection is an example of the fabrics she found – a soft jersey suede which she has embellished with patch pockets. She came home laden down with pieces handmade from quality fabrics for her first collection, recalling the hotel room with fabric samples strewn all over the floor – “it looked like a drug den”. Her tireless use of social media to promote her work has ensured a following of 35,000 on Instagram. With her porcelain skin and long auburn hair, she is the best walking advertisement for her own designs. “I love using other models, but when I [model] it myself, it gets such a good response,” she says. Her debut streetwear show “I Survived Myself” in the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin in September, billed as “blending bold fashion design, personal expression and cultural influence”, was a tour de force. The long unisex faux fur coats, printed suits with faux fur trim, lace dresses, ruffle skirts, cargo pants, camouflage and pop art prints delivered great impact. Woolly mammoth coats or sexy skintight bodysuits with Davy Crockett-style headgear created a look of feral femininity with occasional bondage accents. Fake fur duffle bags, furry boots and couples connected by fur ropes were par for the course. Sections of the show called Strength and Rebirth were references to her previous mental health struggles; statement print leggings were composed of personal messages, and another outfit was a patchwork of newspaper headlines. “I am truly passionate about what I love and what I do, and that saved my life,” she says. “Money will come in due course, but it will come in the right way. I am not going to churn out T-shirts that are going to a landfill dump. My clothing tells a story about who I am.” Maguire comes from an interesting background: her father is a solicitor turned winemaker of Les Deux Cols, co-owner of 64 Wines in Glasthule in Dublin; her mother, Lucy Gaffney, is a well-known businesswoman and equality advocate. Both are great supporters of her work. She is very clear about priorities. “I want to stay making and in my own world – I would never get out of bed if I was scrolling all day. I want to stay unique and get inspired by real things, not what’s on my phone.” Plans include arranging events where customers can view the collection first-hand – “I like that idea of interaction – I want to build a community and talk to people through my clothing.” Visit www.rashhiiid.com or follow her on Instagram @rashhiiid © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Patchy bus service ‘demoralising’ for residents in south Dublin suburb
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/11/24/patchy-bus-service-demoralising-for-residents-in-south-dublin-suburb/
Time Published: 2025-11-24T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Residents of a south Dublin suburb say the area is being “left behind” and “forgotten by those that make the decisions” due to infrequent and unreliable bus services, despite its recent population growth. Cristina Gheorghe, originally from Romania, has lived in the Kilternan area, in the foothills of the Dublin mountains about 1.5km from Carrickmines and 6km from Bray, since 2009. She described the issues as “demoralising and sad”. To access the city centre by bus, the area has the 118, which runs only once a day from Kilternan to Eden Quay at 7.45am from Monday to Friday with no return service, and the 44 bus from Enniskerry to Dublin City University, running about once every hour. She takes public transport to work in the city centre but if it doesn’t come, she says, she can’t wait an hour on the next bus and has to get a taxi or a lift to the Luas stop, which is two kilometres away. “How can we have independent kids and grandparents – when we have to jump in the car?” “It has a massive impact, you’re left with no solution. Everyone here drives but it’s not good for the environment.” Local Fine Gael councillor Pierce Dargan sees it as a “failing” that the Luas is not supported by bus routes. He also said not everyone can take the Luas, depending on where their destination is. He said the routes in the area had “always been an issue” but the situation had become “more severe” when BusConnects changed the routes earlier this year. “There are more houses being built here than almost anywhere else in the country ... the population has increased by so much and we don’t see any more routes being announced or frequency increased.” [ ‘It’s a crazy set-up’: residents who lost out in bus changes protest against new routesOpens in new window ] He said the 63 bus route, which directly linked Kilternan with the large town of Dún Laoghaire, had been split into two routes, the L26 and the L27. He said people need to travel to Dún Laoghaire for work, school or any county council services. Barry Mason, who lives in Kilternan, takes the L26, which is scheduled to run every half an hour, to work in Blackrock. “The situation is frustrating. More often than not I’m complaining about it. My daughter calls the L26 my arch-nemesis,” he said. Mason uses the service in the morning on his way to work but said “as the day progresses it gets worse”. He said there were at least 20 other people from the area who travel to Blackrock for work and more rely on it to catch connecting services such as the L27 to Dún Laoghaire or the Luas. In the evening, he waits for the 4.25pm bus to get home. Last week the bus arrived on time only once, he said. He said there was no direct bus to Bray. “If there was a bus that could go to Bray via Shankill, it would connect Kilternan and surrounding areas to the Dart,” he said. “As it currently stands it feels as we have been left very short of alternatives and heavily reliant on the L26, which ghosts people.” Brian Vaughan, who lives in nearby Carrickmines, is considering moving to Bray as there is no direct route to Bray for his twin daughters and at least 10 others from the area, where they attend their nearest Gaelscoil secondary school. “It’s very hard for them to get around. It’s 15 minutes by car but it’s almost impossible for them to get to school.” He said the family had to buy a second car as they cannot rely on public transport. “It’s difficult on my daughters and people of the same age in the area. We’re spending a lot of time in the car and on petrol when we shouldn’t have to.” A spokeswoman for the National Transport Authority said it “regularly reviews services” across the Transport for Ireland network to “ensure they meet passenger needs and values feedback from local communities”. “Concerns regarding services, direct connections from Kilternan and overall reliability will be taken into account as part of ongoing service reviews.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Regardless of whether it’s sunny, windy or raining, or possibly even all three at once, a stop at Blackrock Cottage is a must when in Salthill. Open for daytime breakfast and lunch and weekend dinners, chef Michael McManus’s goal is to create memories. Try his elevated classics such salmon with brown bread or seafood chowder, or go for one his Asian-inspired hits. The new covered and heated outdoor area is a welcome addition for walkers and pet-owners. JC Takashi Miyazaki’s casual Japanese restaurant puts a strong focus on sustainable ingredients, but always in a fun and relaxed manner. It’s rare that a chef surrenders a Michelin star, but making that decision has allowed Ichigo Ichie to become a Cork nexus for interesting and tasty food, served with a choice range of natural wines. Star billing goes to the handmade buckwheat noodles, served hot and cold in various dishes. JC Izz is more than a cafe – it’s a vibrant meeting of Cork and Palestinian culture, bursting with hospitality and bold, aromatic dishes. Highlights from chef Eman Aburabi include the popular taster plate of hummus, babaganoush, zingy tabbouleh and warm manaeesh. Don’t skip the Musakhan – roast chicken with sumac and spices baked on bread. AD A Chinese grill house where the skewers are the big draw: cumin-dusted duck tongue, mahogany-skinned quail, and spicy lamb with a smoking fat cap. The sides are no afterthought either: crisp chilli-oil potatoes, bubbling corn-and-cheese, and oyster grilled with garlic and glass noodles. Pair it all with beer, which comes by the pint or in giant self-pour pots. Read our review here. CH Tokyo native and classically trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu is the man behind Matsui Ramen, a real-deal weekend ramen joint tucked away in a Kildare GAA club. Try prawn tuskemen, chilled thick noodles with a rich and savoury prawn broth, or warm up with tantanmen, a creamy and sesame child broth with thin noodles and minced pork. And if you fancy getting your hands on authentic Japanese knives to up your kitchen game, Ken is the man to ask. JC Scéal Cafe’s bright and modern interior with windows overlooking the marina is the perfect backdrop for its laser sharp and utterly moreish viennoiserie and speciality coffee. Shelves are stacked with sourdough loaves, which cut open to reveal glossy bubbly interiors. Owners Charlotte Leonard-Kane and Shane Palmer have generated a cult following from their time in Dublin 8, many of whom gladly make the pilgrimage to Greystones for their flaky pastry fix. This autumn has seen the publication of the Scéal cookbook, showing exactly how it’s all done. JC This slick diningroom is a clever mash-up of the Big Fan crew, Hidden Agenda promoters and Whiplash beer – so you’re set for great food, tunes and drinks. The food does tend to steal the show, though; chefs Alex Zhang and Chun Li bring traditional Chinese cooking techniques together with top Irish produce for lip-smacking, umami-rich dumplings, bao and Xiao Chi. Comfy seats are a big bonus, that is, until the music pulls you up for a dance. Read our review here. AD Tang now has four Dublin locations, including its newest on Windmill Lane. Its familiar Middle Eastern-inspired salads and wraps remain wildly popular, alongside queue-worthy brunch dishes, elevated since chef Keith Coleman (ex-Fumbally and Fia) became executive chef. It serves dinner on Thursday and Friday, moving from its Cumberland Place terrace to indoors on Abbey Street for the winter. Expect more vibrant, colourful plates of Middle Eastern favourites and a lively drinks list. Read our review here. AD Long a tourist town, Killarney has steadily established a quality food and drink scene in recent years. Nowhere embodies this more than Tango, a combination Argentinian parrilla and Neapolitan pizza restaurant from Facundo Rodulfo and Pamela Neumann. A lover of fire and grill, Rodulfo marries his heritage and experiences in beef empanadas, choripan sausage sandwiches and oozing grilled provolone cheese. Look out for Tango’s first cookbook or attend a masterclass to learn the tricks for yourself. JC Breakfast is now served in this restored 1820s coach house, where three fires burn all day. Lunch and dinner bring confit duck croquettes with butternut squash purée, croque monsieur with house-baked ham and Comté, and Kilmore Quay monkfish with charred baby gem. Next door, you’ll find Roundwood Stores bakery offers more casual options. CH Our pizza obsession owes much to brothers Ronan and Eugene Greaney, whose Dough Bros business continues to thrive. This year they opened Lil’ Bros slice shop on Eyre Square, but Middle Street remains the best place to experience their craft – quirky, creative Neapolitan pizzas showcasing top Irish artisan ingredients, cooked fresh and fast in a wood-fired oven. They also offer a stellar list of soft drinks, local beers and quaffable wines. AD © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SECI pulls up Rajasthan discom for reneging on power sale pact; BlackRock, IFC, KKR-backed project developers in a tizzy

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. A standoff between state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India (SECI) and Rajasthan Urja Vikas and IT Services Ltd (RUVITL) over a power sale agreement has raised concerns about the adverse impact on investors’ interest in India’s green energy trajectory. The dispute centres around a 630 MW SECI contract from firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) projects, which will use energy storage to supply round-the-clock electricity. SECI has objected to the distribution company RUVITL’s move to back out of the agreement, arguing that the power sale agreement (PSA) is legally binding, according to documents reviewed by Mint and two people aware of the development. “RUVITL cannot unilaterally withdraw the procurement of the 630 MW capacity after three and half months from the date of signing the PSA. The PSA is a legally binding document, and any withdrawal at this stage may have regulatory and contractual implications," according to a 9 October SECI communication to RUVITL. Analysts say the standoff may shake investor confidence, given that India will need to invest $1.3 trillion in non-fossil power generation capacity by 2035 to meet India's energy transition goal and to stay on track to meet net zero by 2070. This latest setback also comes in the backdrop of union power ministry directing the SECI, NTPC Ltd, NHPC Ltd, and SJVN Ltd to cancel the awarded contracts by the end of this month wherein it’s not feasible to sign power purchase agreements (PPAs) and PSAs, as reported by Mint earlier. Many discoms have chosen to wait for lower tariffs rather than sign PSAs straightaway, holding up the whole process. Rating agency Icra said on Thursday that only 5.8 GW of renewable capacity has been awarded in the first eight months of FY26. India awarded 47.3 GW in FY24 and 40.6 GW in FY25. Unsigned PPA capacity remains at about 40-45 GW as of date, according to Icra. The 630 MW bid was called by SECI to initially meet the seasonal and time-specific power demand of Delhi power distribution companies (discoms) – BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) – which didn’t sign the PSA due to regulatory delay; post which SECI offered the power to other discoms, including RUVITL. The e-auction for the FDRE was held on 25 July, with the letter of awards (LoAs) issued to the successful bidders on 7 August. The lowest discovered tariff through the e-auction was ₹4.98 per unit. "This is simply not acceptable in any rules-based system and will have a bearing on investor's interest in India' green energy space," said a chief executive officer of one of the power generation companies that has the LoA for the tender. SECI is an intermediary in the renewable energy chain, and has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for this contract with project developers —BlackRock’ Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) owned Vena Energy Aura Private Ltd, International Finance Corp. (IFC) and KKR-backed Hero Future Energies’ (HFE) Hero Solar Energy Private Ltd, JSW Group’ JSW Neo Energy Ltd, New York-based I Squared Capital-backed Hexa Climate Solutions Private Ltd and KKR-backed Serentica India Renewables Private Ltd. It has also signed PSA with Rajasthan’ power distribution company (discom) RUVITL, in this case. India’s installed renewable energy capacity is around 197 GW, and solar and wind account for 129.92 GW and 53.60 GW, respectively. Interestingly, Rajasthan is the state with the highest installed green energy capacity at 40.40 GW. “The real concern is spillover. If one state feels it can get away with reopening a concluded contract, others will eventually test the limits. That’s how a one-off becomes a habit. And once doubt enters the system, it lingers for years, no matter how many reassurances follow," said Sanjay Aggarwal, former President of Fortum India and presently advisor for Fortum Holdings BV. "India can absorb an aberration. What it cannot absorb is a pattern — especially one built on the mistaken belief that investors will always come back, no matter what." “Capital has options. Credibility is how you stay on the shortlist," added Aggarwal, who was also the global head of Solar for the Finnish state-run energy utility. Spokespersons for Global Infrastructure Partners, I Squared Capital, JSW Group and Sanjeev Aggarwal, founder and chairman, Hexa Climate Solutions declined comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of SECI, RUVITL, Rajasthan government, ministries of new and renewable energy and power, Vena Energy, Hero Future Energies, Serentica India Renewables Private Ltd and global investors KKR, and International Finance Corporation on Wednesday night remained unanswered. Queries emailed to spokesperson for BRPL and BYPL on late Wednesday also remained unanswered. The stand-offRUVITL, in a 26 September communication to SECI, which was reviewed by Mint, said, some facts emerged after signing of the PSA and weren’t disclosed earlier by SECI. These include non-disclosure that the bidding was conducted as a state-specific bid tailored to meet Delhi’s power demand pattern, Delhi’s refusal to accept the allocation, and deviation by SECI from the tariff adoption process. “In light of the above, the matter was deliberated in detail during the recent Board meeting of RUVITL. After considering all relevant facts and prevailing circumstances, the Board has taken a decision not to proceed further with the procurement of power from the 630 MW ISTS FDRE Projects," the RUVITL communication said. Meanwhile, SECI in its 9 October communication said it "received a letter from RUVITL after three months of signing the PSA, citing some reasons, i.e. Delhi demand pattern, Approval process of CERC, etc, and not to proceed with the procurement." Before signing the agreement with SECI, RUVITL is expected to check the matching demand profile, seasonal demand, and all other aspects, SECI said. “So, not to proceed with the procurement mentioning the reasons are afterthought and contrary to the terms and condition of signed PSA." It said RUVITL had confirmed on 10 June 2025 that it would offtake the power after due diligence, and that all relevant documents, including the request for selection, PPAs, PSA and CERC tariff order, were shared before the PSA was signed on 30 June 2025.

SECI has maintained full transparency throughout the entire process," the SECI communication said. Given that a PSA is legally enforceable, SECI can approach the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) or a State Electricity Regulatory Commision (SERC) for its adoption. In the event of a default by RUVITL, there are also financial consequences wherein SECI can terminate the PSA and claim damages from RUVITL, which can be equivalent to 24 months of charges for the contracted capacity (calculated at 80% demand fulfilment ratio or DFR). For any legal adjudication, it can go to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel) and also has the recourse to challenge an Aptel order in the Supreme Court. SECI does not bear the counterparty risk. Recalling earlier issuesThe controversial move by the solar resource-endowed state of Rajasthan is not a one-off event in the Indian green energy space. The sector has gone through similar trials and tribulations and faced investor criticism over the earlier attempt by then Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to renegotiate clean energy tariffs. The Punjab government led by then chief minister Amarinder Singh had also tried to renegotiate clean energy contracts, with the Punjab State Power Corp. Ltd (PSPCL) seeking a discount. Analysts remain hopeful about India’s green energy space. Icra’s outlook for the renewable sector remains stable, led by strong policy support, superior tariff competitiveness and sustainability initiatives by large commercial and industrial customers. "However, challenges remain on the execution front, including land and transmission infrastructure, delays in signing PPAs, exposure to equipment prices and distribution utility finances," Icra said in a note on 20 November. RUVITL, in a 26 September communication to SECI, which was reviewed by Mint, said, some facts emerged after signing of the PSA and weren’t disclosed earlier by SECI.

She brought a lot of life into our garden, it’s the people who make a community & with the mark she left on us she’ll always be a part of ours.” Mrs Gallagher was also a much valued member of the SHEP Community Choir. A representative of the choir posted that Stella was a member “since the very beginning” and loved being part of that community. “She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie. She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others. Advertisement “She was also a very committed and generous supporter of the choir’s fundraising initiatives. She was much loved and will be very much missed. May her gentle and kind soul be at peace.” A fellow choir member said that Stella was a “kind, thoughtful, gentle lady who always had time for a chat” with another member describing her as “ beautiful both inside and out.” Her former coworkers in Eli Lilly in Kinsale noted her “kind caring nature” as well as her competency as an engineer. One person who worked alongside her for many years said that it was a “pleasure and privilege to have worked with her” whilst another stated that they had learned a lot from her “both in engineering and in life.” Another person spoke of their fond memories of working with Stella in Pegasus Engineering in the late 1980′s at the start of their respective careers. Mrs Gallagher, nee Griffin, was also fondly remembered by parents whose children attended St Anthony’s NS in Ballinlough at the same time as her sons. A classmate of hers in secondary school remembered her “ warm, kind, gentle and unassuming” friend. Mrs Gallagher’s kind nature was present from the very start of her life with an old classmate from primary school who had not seen her for decades recalling her gentleness. Meanwhile, the funeral will take place on Tuesday of Mrs Gallagher whose husband Brian was also seriously injured in the stabbing incident. Her death notice reads that she is survived by her husband Brian and her children Ciara, Conor and Mark. She is also “sadly missed” by her brother Denis, parents in law Val and Geraldine, brothers in law Alan and Mark, sisters in law Erika, Ann, Michele and Mary, nephews nieces, extended family and friends. The “much loved mother,” will lie in repose at the Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork from 5pm to 6pm tomorrow. Her requiem mass will take place on Tuesday at 11am in the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Ballinlough. The mass will be live streamed. Burial will follow at St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock in Cork city. Meanwhile, David Gallagher, with an address at Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough in Cork has been charged with the murder of his mother, and with assault causing harm to his father, close to the family home in Ballinlough last Monday night.

Title: Why did Wall Street just dump $5.4 billion in Strategy MSTR stock?

MicroStrategy’s role as Bitcoin proxy is fading as Wall Street shifts to a more direct exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For a while, owning Bitcoin was professionally awkward. Big asset managers couldn’t touch it, compliance teams didn’t know what to do with it, and internal mandates typically banned the direct custody of anything that looked like a bearer instrument. But equities? Equities were fine. That’s how MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based enterprise software firm, became the most traded Bitcoin proxy in the US equity market. After CEO Michael Saylor pivoted the entire company into a Bitcoin holding vehicle in 2020, institutional desks began buying MSTR not for its software solutions, but for its balance sheet. The trade was about finding a liquid, listed, regulator-recognized asset that let you get Bitcoin exposure on your books without the hassle of actually holding it. That trade worked for four years. Saylor issued convertible notes, bought billions in BTC, and amplified shareholder exposure well beyond spot. MSTR became the shadow ETF that Wall Street wasn’t allowed to buy. And the demand was real: at one point, MSTR traded at a 2× premium to its net Bitcoin per share. The company leaned into it. “We’re a leveraged long Bitcoin operating company,” Saylor said in 2021. Some analysts even stopped modeling software revenue altogether when analyzing MicroStrategy’s performance. Many allocators treated MSTR as a synthetic Bitcoin play. The logic was: direct Bitcoin access remained constrained, but here was a stock whose fortunes were tightly linked to Bitcoin’s. That arrangement worked until it didn’t. Between the end of Q2 and the end of Q3 2025, institutional portfolios decreased their marked paper exposure in MSTR by approximately $5.38 billion, based on aggregated filings (from ~$36.32 billion to ~$30.94 billion). That represents a drop of ≈14.8% in institutional paper value held. This wasn’t a markdown. Bitcoin remained relatively steady throughout the quarter at around $95,000, even peaking above its new ATH of $125,000 at one point. MSTR traded mostly sideways during the period, hovering near $175. This kind of price stability effectively rules out forced selling and deleveraging as primary drivers. There was no wipeout event to blame this on. This means the exposure vanished because institutions actively took it off. Major fund managers, including Capital International, Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity, each trimmed over $1 billion in exposure or close to it. The reduction spans the institutional ladder, not just fringe players. In aggregate terms, it’s a 14.8% reduction in value across the board. That may not sound catastrophic, but in dollar terms it is meaningful, and structurally it marks a pivot. A $5.3 billion reduction needs context. On the one hand, it’s large. Even for Wall Street, where hundreds of billions of dollars change hands every day, it’s enough to move the needle. On the other hand, it’s modest relative to total institutional holdings of MSTR, which topped $31 billion at the end of Q3. Imagine a fund with $100 billion in assets deciding to retreat by $15 billion from a trade; the move is visible, but the exposure remains. That’s the state of MSTR: still widely held, still relevant, but no longer unique or immune. Expressed differently: if you owned $100 of institutional MSTR exposure at the end of Q2, you would hold about $85.20 at the end of Q3. If you held $1 billion, you would be down to ~$852 million in exposure. The drop matters because it signals shifting conviction. But the trade is far from vanished. It looks more like institutions quietly exploring alternatives. Historical context reinforces the point. In 2021, when Bitcoin hit earlier peaks and volatility reigned, MSTR boasted premiums of nearly 2× its net Bitcoin holdings per share. That gap has since compressed. In that light, the Q3 reduction marks a transition from scarcity-driven premium to choose-your-route flexibility. In Q4, the table has changed. Bitcoin has retreated from recent highs. Another pause or pullback in Bitcoin may present a test for MSTR’s remaining holders. Bitcoin remaining below $90,000 for a while would expose the leverage embedded in MSTR: corporate debt, equity dilution risk, and software results overshadowed by treasury holdings. However, if Bitcoin finds support at $100,000 or higher, MSTR could retain its appeal as a Bitcoin-enhanced vehicle. If Bitcoin moves higher again, companies might decide to reverse course and increase MSTR exposure. On the flip side, touching $80,000 will likely prompt an even larger reduction in MSTR exposure. Either scenario suggests Q4 filings could show a reduction or a return to previous levels of MSTR exposure, but most likely no increase compared to Q2. This change matters for more than just the companies involved. It marks a milestone in how mature Bitcoin exposure has become. For a while, MSTR served as a workaround for Wall Street. Now, that pathway has become mainstream with both institutions and retail active in MSTR trading. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and other regulated custody solutions mean large portfolios can now hold BTC without the equity-wrapper compromise. As institutional strategies evolve, assets like MSTR stop being essential and start being optional. The implication is twofold for retail. First, the fact that institutions are rethinking the proxy trade is validation that Bitcoin access has entered a new phase. If allocators feel comfortable holding Bitcoin directly, that signals deeper structural acceptance. Second, MSTR likely shifts in role: rather than being the go-to way to hold Bitcoin, it may become a tactical hedge or leveraged play. MSTR is still enormous. More than $30 billion in institutional market exposure remained at the end of Q3. The company is far from redundant, but its monopoly on institutional Bitcoin access is over. For investors who still believe in Bitcoin long-term and are comfortable with corporate wrapper risk, MSTR remains a viable option. For those seeking pure Bitcoin exposure without the corporate overlay, the path has broadened. The proxy era has transformed. The 14.8% reduction in institutional value held in MSTR matters because it reflects a change in mindset, not a mass exodus. For Bitcoin, it’s a marker of maturation. For MSTR, it’s a pivot in role. For the market, it’s the quiet next act in the story of institutional crypto adoption.

Title: XRP ETFs Could See Aggressive Accumulation – Here Are The Numbers

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP has entered a new phase in its growth as Spot XRP ETFs begin trading across the United States. The excitement surrounding institutional access to XRP has grown quickly in recent weeks, especially as filings and inflow reports hint at rising interest from funds preparing to scale their exposure. A market commentator known as Chad Steingraber presented a projection showing just how intense ETF accumulation could become if issuers adopt an acquisition strategy similar to what was seen in Bitcoin ETFs. The estimates outline an aggressive period of accumulation that could reduce XRP’s available supply far faster than many expect, and here are the numbers. Steingraber’s first scenario examines a modest but steady accumulation model where 12 Spot XRP ETF issuers acquire an average of 3million XRP per day. His projection is based on focusing on the average rather than trying to predict which fund accumulates the most, because the combined impact is what ultimately matters for XRP’s market price. Under this setup, daily inflows would reach up to 36 million XRP. Over a standard five-day trading week, that accumulation would climb to 160 million XRP. Over the course of a month, the amount absorbed by ETFs would increase to 720 million XRP. By the end of a full year, this single projection implies that as much as 8.64 billion XRP could be removed from public circulation and locked into ETFs. Of course, these numbers only take into account the possibility of consecutive net inflow days and no net outflow days. Although these figures are hypothetical, the pace aligns with the early patterns seen in Bitcoin ETFs, where strong averages across issuers created a sustained demand for Bitcoin. In another post, Steingraber offered a more forceful accumulation model using the activity of Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF as a benchmark. Data shows that the Bitwise XRP ETF received inflows of about 5.82 million XRP in its first trading day. In this second scenario, the projected daily acquisition rate is doubled to about 6 million XRP per issuer. If 12 funds follow this pattern, the combined accumulation could hit 72 million XRP every day. Extending the same five-day cycle, the weekly total would rise toward 360 million XRP, while monthly totals would reach approximately 1.44 billion XRP. Over a full year, this more aggressive model ends with 17.28 billion XRP absorbed into ETF products. “The entire XRP public supply will be gone UNLESS THE PRICE GOES ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH,” Steingraber said. The projections serve as a wake-up call on how quickly XRP’s supply ecosystem might change once ETF inflows stabilize and larger issuers like Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares and WisdomTree get in on the action. However, BlackRock, which oversees the largest Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is yet to make any move on a Spot XRP ETF. The company had confirmed in August that it has no immediate plans to file for one.

Title: Financial advisors who ignore Bitcoin ditched by young wealthy Americans

The Great Wealth Transfer has a new filter test for advisors: if you don’t speak crypto, you don’t get the account. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Younger, wealthier Americans seem to be rewriting the house rules of wealth management. They like broad equity indices. They park cash in T-bills. They still buy real estate and private deals. But they also expect to see Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other digital assets on the same dashboard as everything else. For them, crypto is a normal slice of a portfolio. For many of their advisors, though, it’s still a compliance headache and a career risk. That gap between young investors and advisors is there, and it’s getting wider every day. Zerohash’s new “Crypto and the Future of Wealth” report surveyed 500 investors aged 18–40 in the US with household incomes ranging from $100,000 to over $1 million. Most of them already work with a financial advisor or private wealth manager. Yet when it comes to crypto, a big chunk runs a separate stack of apps, exchanges, and wallets because their advisory firm either can’t or won’t touch it. Tens of trillions will flow from older Americans to younger heirs and charities over the next two decades. The people set to receive that capital already treat a 5–20% crypto allocation as usual, and they’re now benchmarking advisors on whether they can underwrite that reality without blowing up fiduciary duty, tax planning, or basic cybersecurity. The decision younger wealthy clients have to make is simple: if you won’t manage the part of my portfolio I care most about, I’ll find someone who will. The numbers from Zerohash’s survey are blunt: around 61% percent of affluent 18–40-year-olds already hold crypto. That share climbs to 69% among the highest earners in the sample, and most don’t see crypto as a fun lottery. Among high-income investors, 58% put 11–20% of their portfolios into digital assets. For all of them, crypto sits in the same mental bucket as real estate and core equity funds, not as a side bet. The study notes that 43% of young investors allocate 5–10% of their portfolios to crypto, 27% allocate 11–20%, and 11% allocate more than 20%. Zerohash also adds that 84% of crypto holders plan to increase those allocations over the next year. Those are the numbers for the demand side. On the supply side, the advisory channel is basically a ghost town. The survey showed 76% of crypto holders invest independently, outside their brokerage or wealth management firm. Only 24% hold crypto through an advisor at all. These are not your BTC maximalists living in cold storage; these are people who already pay a basis-point fee for advice and still feel they have to run a separate portfolio in another browser tab. Their money is already moving, as 35% percent of all affluent investors in the sample say they have shifted assets away from advisors who do not offer crypto. Among the top-earning group on $500,000 to over $1 million, that share jumps to 51%. More than half of those who left moved between $250,000 and $1 million per head. And yet, the same dataset shows how easy it would be for wealth managers to keep these clients. About 64% of respondents say they would stay with an advisor longer or bring more assets across if that advisor provided crypto access; 63% say they would feel more comfortable investing through an advisor if digital assets sat on the same portfolio dashboard as their stocks and bonds. The main takeaway is that the bar for advisors is very, very low. The bar isn’t “become a crypto hedge fund,” but “recognize this asset class exists and can be held inside the same reporting stack.” Layer this on top of the Great Wealth Transfer, and the stakes get very large, very fast. Cerulli and RBC estimate that total wealth moving from older Americans to younger generations and charities will be in the $84–$124 trillion range through the 2040s. That wall of inheritance and business proceeds is drifting toward cohorts who already treat crypto as a regular part of their portfolio. If the demand is this clear, why do so many advisors still default to “we can’t touch that”? Part of the answer sits in product design. For a long time, the only way an advisory firm could get crypto exposure into a model portfolio was through weird closed-end funds, trust structures, or offshore vehicles nobody wanted to explain in a compliance exam. Even now, with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs out in the wild, many RIAs and broker-dealers treat those tickers as curiosities. Then there is the paperwork. Investment Policy Statements written in the past 10 years often lump Bitcoin into “prohibited speculative instruments” alongside penny stocks and options. Changing that language takes committee meetings, E&O reviews, and legal memos. The path of least resistance for a mid-level compliance officer is usually to write “not approved at this time.” Underneath that sits custody law. Under SEC rules, registered advisers need to hold client funds and securities with a “qualified custodian,” which usually means a bank, broker-dealer, or similar institution that meets strict safeguards. For years, crypto didn’t fit neatly into those boxes, and the coveted SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin 121) made life even more complicated by forcing public banks that held digital assets to record matching liabilities on their balance sheets. That logjam has started to clear. In early 2025, the SEC rolled out new guidance and no-action relief that made it easier for state-chartered trust companies to serve as qualified crypto custodians, effectively retiring SAB 121. The regulatory stack might still look like uncharted waters for many, but it no longer treats digital assets as radioactive waste. However, on the ground, a new cast of partners is rushing into the gap. Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers offers custody and trade execution through Fidelity Digital Assets, wired directly into the same Wealthscape interface that an RIA already uses for stocks and bonds. Eaglebrook Advisors runs model portfolios and SMAs focused on BTC and ETH for wealth managers, with portfolio reporting and billing wired into standard RIA systems. BitGo has built a platform aimed at wealth management that ties qualified custody to a TAMP-style overlay. Anchorage Digital pitches itself as a regulated digital asset custodian with reporting, reconciliation, and governance controls explicitly designed for RIAs. On paper, a mid-sized advisory shop could now bolt on a crypto sleeve with partners it already recognizes from the institutional world. But in practice, the pipes inside many firms are still stuck in the last cycle. OMS and PMS systems do not always know what to do with staking yield. The billing logic struggles with on-chain positions. The structural gap shows up in the Zerohash numbers around behavior: 76% of crypto holders in the survey buy and manage their digital assets independently. That means they already know how to move funds through exchanges, hardware wallets, and on-chain apps. For that cohort, advisors become essentially useless for buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other number of coins ranging from XRP to DOGE. Their value lies in tax, estate, and risk engineering for something the client has already done. This is where the “crypto-competent advisor” idea matters. A serious under-40 client today doesn’t care if their advisor can quote the Nakamoto consensus section of the Bitcoin whitepaper. They care about whether that advisor can: None of that is science fiction anymore. It’s just regular old financial advisor work. And it’s work that younger, wealthier investors have begun using as a scorecard. Zerohash’s survey shows a slow-motion run on legacy investment platforms. Start with the top-line: 35% of affluent investors in the 18–40 bracket have already moved assets away from advisors who do not provide crypto access. Among the highest-earning slice, that share is 51%. More than half of those who left had household incomes between $250,000 and $1 million. Put that into revenue terms. A $750,000 account billed at 1% is $7,500 per year. Lose ten of those relationships because you cannot stomach a 5–10% Bitcoin sleeve, and you have burned through the equivalent of a junior advisor’s salary. Lose fifty and you are into “we used to have an office in that city” territory. The path usually looks something like this: First, the client opens a self-directed account or a mobile app to get exposure while their advisor waffles. They buy the spot BTC ETF or a mix of coins on a mainstream exchange. Then, as that bucket grows and starts to feel real, they go shopping for someone who can treat it as part of a serious balance sheet. Crypto-focused RIAs and multi-family offices have picked up that brief, from DAiM in California to new arms like Abra Capital Management. Along the way, TikTok, YouTube, and Discord serve as the new discovery layer. A creator walks through how they run a 60/30/10 portfolio with T-bills, index ETFs, and a BTC/ETH sleeve. A podcast brings on a family office CIO who talks casually about budgeting 5% for digital assets. The message lands: if your advisor cannot even discuss this, others will. Culture becomes distribution. The golden aura around mahogany offices, golf club memberships, and brand-name wirehouses sits alongside a screen showing real-time P&L for a Coinbase or Binance account. For clients under 40, trust is starting to look like proof-of-reserves, qualified custody, hardware wallets, 2FA, and the ability to see everything in one portal, not just a logo they grew up seeing on CNBC. The Zerohash survey backs this up: 82% percent of respondents say that moves by names like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley into digital assets make them more at ease with crypto in advisory portfolios. This is brand halo used in a new way: not to sell the firm’s own stock-picking skill, but to validate a new asset class they already hold. The portfolio design underneath all this is boring in the best way. Most affluent young investors in the survey sit inside a barbell: treasuries and broad indices on one side, a 5–20% crypto sleeve on the other, and some private deals or real estate sprinkled in between. They are not trying to reinvent modern portfolio theory. They are just adding one more risk bucket, then asking why the person who manages everything else in their life cannot help them manage this one. On the policy side, it lists Bitcoin and Ethereum as permitted assets in the IPS, subject to a defined cap, with clear language on liquidity events, rebalancing bands, and concentration limits. On the product side, it offers a simple menu: spot ETFs for clients who care about convenience and easy tax reporting; direct coins with institutional custody for those who want on-chain access; minimal alt exposure, if any, and only in products that clear compliance checks. On the operations side, it chooses partners who plug into existing reporting and billing systems: perhaps Fidelity Crypto for custody and execution, Eaglebrook or Bitwise strategies inside model portfolios, Anchorage or BitGo for more advanced clients who need governance features and staking. And it works on cybersecurity: how to talk about hardware wallets, key backups, SIM-swap risk, and what happens if a client loses access. On the human side, it stops treating crypto questions as a nuisance and starts treating them as an early warning system. The client who quietly moves $500,000 to a self-directed platform because you refused even to discuss Bitcoin is telling you something. Not necessarily anything about their risk tolerance, but a lot about how replaceable they think you are. All of this sits atop that $80-plus trillion to $120-plus trillion wall of wealth slated to move from boomers to their heirs over the next two decades. The inheritors of that capital grew up in a world where spending and sending feel as normal as wiring a bank transfer, and they’re busy watching which advisors respect that reality. The window is open for Wall Street, but it will not stay open forever. The first wave of crypto-competent RIAs, family offices, and fintech platforms is already laying the groundwork for weaving Bitcoin and digital assets into plain-vanilla wealth management without blowing up fiduciary duty, tax planning, or cybersecurity. Everyone else can keep arguing about whether a 5–10% crypto sleeve belongs in a portfolio while their clients quietly walk their accounts out the door. The wealth transfer is happening either way. The question is who gets to book the AUM when it lands.

Title: Easygoing but disciplined - descriptions of Paul Costelloe’s clothes also applied to the man

Celebrated for dressing Princess Diana and creating the uniforms of British Airways staff, Paul Costelloe rose to become one of Ireland’s most successful fashion designers. In Ireland he has been associated with Dunnes Stores for the past 20 years for his collections of homewares, menswear and womenswear, a collaboration recently celebrated at his home in Monkstown. Following in the wake of Sybil Connolly who was the first to give Irish fashion an international profile, he established his name in Dublin as a young designer in 1979 having trained at the Grafton Academy followed by a period in Paris and Milan. His tailoring and early use of Donegal tweed and Irish linen made his name – breezy early dresses in the 1980s made from handkerchief linen were a sensation. That mix of tailoring and what is called flou with a strong colour sense continued to mark his style throughout his career along with a nostalgia for the freedom of the 1960s. He was also a gifted painter. Easygoing, low-key but disciplined were words used to describe his clothes, which could also accurately describe his personality. Forthright in his opinions which often generated controversy, he had a healthy disrespect for the rhetoric and hype surrounding the industry. His candour and lack of pretension made him popular with the British press. His real break came in London in 1983/84 when he was accepted as a member of a select group of British designers called the London Designer Collection, where he showed in London for the first time. That later became London Fashion Week, where he has shown for the past 40 years, most recently in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom where his collections were always the first on the schedule marking the opening of the week. The youngest of seven children of Willie Costelloe, a raincoat manufacturer who was the son of a Limerick publican and a member of the old IRA, his mother Catherine Curran was an American from New York. Paul grew up with a stylish mother and four sisters which certainly had an influence on him. Educated in Willow Park and Blackrock College, after leaving school he spent a year at the Grafton Academy before heading to Paris and a job with Jacques Esterel, the avant-garde French fashion designer. From Paris, he went to Milan, working at the department store La Rinascente. Then he took off for New York, which he recalled as the toughest part of his career, before returning to Ireland and setting up in business. His couture collections in London, shown twice yearly, demonstrated the freedom to design without commercial constraint as the clothes were only made to order and not produced for ready-to-wear sale. His last show, for winter 2025, was staged in Dublin’s City Hall in September, but he was unable to attend due to illness. He is survived by his wife Anne (née Cooper) and their seven children, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul Emmet, William, Nicholas and daughter Jessica. His son William, an artist like his father, has been increasingly involved in the business, as has his daughter Jessica, who is also a trained opera singer.

Title: Crypto CEO Says Bitcoin Was Never Meant To Be ‘Digital Gold’ – So What Is It?

A terse but provocative message by crypto CEO Jacob King has challenged the prevailing narrative around Bitcoin at a time when the asset’s price has reversed much of its 2025 gains. King contends that Bitcoin was never intended to function as a store of value or inflation hedge, two big labels widely used to describe Bitcoin in the past few years. Bitcoin’s price decline in recent weeks has revived long-standing questions about what the cryptocurrency was meant to represent. Much of the price surge earlier in the year has now been erased, and sentiment across the market has shifted into a defensive posture. In light of this, Jacob King released a pointed critique challenging the main arguments that investors have attached to Bitcoin over the past decade. King grounds his argument in the language of the Bitcoin whitepaper, which describes a peer-to-peer electronic cash system designed to facilitate direct online payments without intermediaries. He stresses that the whitepaper never discussed Bitcoin as a store of value, an inflation hedge, a geopolitical refuge, or any of the traits that dominate modern discourse. In King’s view, high fees, limited throughput, and declining real-world use pushed supporters to adopt new perspectives that kept enthusiasm alive, even if those narratives had no connection to what Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, outlined in 2008. Satoshi explicitly described Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer system for online payments. The idea of Bitcoin as a form of digital gold was manufactured by maximalists to attract fresh waves of retail buyers. King’s comments land at a moment when Bitcoin’s price action is playing out anything but stability. The leading cryptocurrency has dropped massively from its 2025 highs, reversing most of the year’s gains and sending shockwaves through the broader market. The decline led to liquidations, weakened sentiment across major altcoins, and raised new doubts about Bitcoin’s defensive qualities during periods of stress. King’s view on Bitcoin clashes directly with the views of some of the most influential voices in global finance. Michael Saylor has repeatedly described Bitcoin as the superior successor to gold, calling it “digital property.” Larry Fink of BlackRock took the idea mainstream when he said Bitcoin had become a hedge to overcome and address local fears, a phrase that suggested the asset was maturing into a global store of value. Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, has also embraced this viewpoint, stating that Bitcoin’s valuation could climb to the $200,000 to $250,000 range if it manages to capture 25% of gold’s market share. Earlier this year, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, noting that Bitcoin now acts as a legitimate competitor to gold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,130. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Tributes have been paid to mother-of-four Stella Gallagher who died following a fatal stabbing incident in Cork earlier this week. Details of her funeral arrangements have been announced for early next week. Ms Gallagher (59) and her husband Brian (63) were both injured in the attack near their home in Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough at around 9pm on Monday night. Both were rushed by ambulance to Cork University Hospital where Ms Gallagher later died. Mr Gallagher underwent emergency surgery for a number of knife wounds including a serious wound to his neckand he spent several days recuperating at CUH before he was discharged from the hospital. He is now recovering with his family. The couple regularly attended Togher Community Garden in Cork with their son David since their retirement. Togher Community Garden is a volunteer-led non-profit community garden in Cork with support from Green Spaces for Health and Cork City Council. Gardeners grow their own fruit and vegetables there. Paying tribute to Ms Gallagher in an online statement, the group said: “It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of our dear friend and fellow gardener, Stella. “Stella was a cherished and invaluable friend to us all in the Togher Community Garden family. Her absence will be deeply felt by everyone here. We especially remember her beautiful smile and the gentle person she was to everyone she met. Our garden will always hold memories of her kindness.” Ms Gallagher was also a member of the Cork Social Health Project (Shep) Choir. Its director, Jim Sheehan, said she was “much loved and greatly missed” in a message of sympathy posted on rip.ie “Stella was a member of the Shep Choir since the very beginning and loved being part of that community,” he said. “She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie. She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others.” A native of Ballinspittle in west Cork, Ms Gallagher qualified as a chemical engineer with a BSc from Cork Institute of Technology, now Munster Technological University, in the 1980s. She worked for US pharmaceutical giant Lilly at its plant in Dunderrow near Kinsale for over three decades. “Stella was a long-standing employee at Lilly Kinsale for over 30 years, and she retired from the company in 2023. Everyone at Lilly Kinsale sends their deepest condolences to the Gallagher family at this very sad time,” the company said in a statement. Ms Gallagher, who is survived by her husband Brian and adult children Ciara, David, Conor and Mark, will be buried in St Michael’s Cemetery, Blackrock following requiem mass at Our Lady Of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough at 11am on Tuesday.

Title: Crypto Investors Are Now Value Investors, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Why

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has pointed out a pivot from crypto speculation to value investing within the blockchain industry. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, has made a post in X suggesting that the current cryptocurrency price dip masks a shift to value investing. He claimed that this new era is driven by Traditional Finance (TradFi) integration, like tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). This comes as Bitcoin price falls to around $84,000 from its October peak of $126,000, and Ethereum (ETH) trades below $2,700. For the longest time, digital assets were synonymous with speculation, but CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the era is quietly coming to an end. On X, he claimed that the market is undergoing a necessary but under-appreciated transformation. In his words, “crypto investors are becoming value investors.” Young Ju pointed out that even as the prices are down, the fundamentals are the strongest they’ve been in the past seven years. In fact, he claims not to have seen fundamentals and price drift this far apart. crypto investors are now value investors https://t.co/oihgm3zh4i — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 22, 2025 Amid this outlook, there is more integration of TradFi with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). He cited the example of the former BlackRock IBIT team members who launched HelloTrade. Noteworthy, HelloTrade is a decentralized exchange that is designed for 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and bonds. Robinhood is also inching towards tokenized private shares, as earlier announced by its CEO, Vlad Tenev. Then there is Strategy, the popular business intelligence and software firm that has made Bitcoin acquisition a hobby. CryptoQuant CEO noted that all of this development suggests that the TradFi system is building infrastructure for a new financial world. Globally, there is a strong movement of tokenization in the TradFi system, marking a revolutionary pivot. During the Hong Kong FinTech Week, held earlier in November, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Chief Executive Eddie Yue unveiled a five-year tokenization plan. He described it as a core pillar for advancing the city’s financial sector. The roadmap includes more than 40 initiatives across four areas: data infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence (AI), resilience, and tokenization of finance. Also, SEGG Media unveiled a $300 million digital asset strategy that combines an 80/20 crypto treasury model with validator income and tokenized sports assets.
