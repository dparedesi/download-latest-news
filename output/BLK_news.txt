Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Stock Photo: apiguide/Shutterstock SINGAPORE, April 23 (Reuters) – Singapore’s PSA International is exploring the sale of its 20% stake in CK Hutchison‘s ports business, two people with knowledge of the matter said, joining the Hong Kong conglomerate in its controversial plans to sell. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison announced last month it would sell its 80% holding in the business which includes two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to a BlackRock-led consortium. The holding has an equity value of $14.2 billion. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as a “reclaiming” of the canal. Chinese state media, however, have criticized it as a betrayal of China’s interests and the country’s market regulator has launched an antitrust review. Whether PSA, a ports operator wholly owned by Singapore state investor Temasek, ultimately decides to sell will depend on whether CK Hutchison goes ahead with the transaction, the two people said. CK Hutchison and the BlackRock-led consortium have agreed to exclusive talks for 145 days. The people, who were not willing to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, declined to comment on a potential sale price for PSA’s stake. PSA declined to comment. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The deal between CK Hutchison and the BlackRock consortium encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $22.8 billion. Overall the Hong Kong conglomerate has interests in 53 ports. Ports in Hong Kong and mainland China were not included in the deal. PSA bought its 20% stake for $4.4 billion in 2006 and has looked at selling previously. Reuters reported in late 2022 that PSA weighed a potential sale. But the two sources said it put the process on hold months later after global shipping activity weakened. Outside of its stake in CK Hutchison, PSA has 70 terminals in 45 countries, including its two flagship ports in Singapore and Belgium, according to its website.

Wicklow Kieran had been visiting the city every weekend to find the Skoda, misplaced after a stag weekend Kieran has spent every weekend since April 4 traipsing the streets of Cork looking for his car. Photo: Tristan O'Connor We’ve all been there, you’ve parked your car and gone away, only to come back not to realise where it is. However, have you ever come back to find your car wasn’t parked in the same neighbourhood that you thought you’d parked it in? Or have you ever considered ringing a local radio station in an attempt to find your motor? That’s exactly what happened to Kieran, who lost his car in the suburbs of Cork City after attending a stag party almost three weeks ago. Driving down from his native Wicklow, Kieran parked his Carlow-registered Skoda Superb in a housing estate within a 30-minute walk from the city centre earlier this month but could not remember where he left it, admitting it has been a “nightmare” and “the stupidest thing I’ve ever done”. He was in regular contact with the gardaí, had visited the impound yard and returned to Cork every weekend since April 4 in an attempt to track down his car. “I had a stag party in Cork and I got into the city late at night and I couldn’t find anywhere to park in the city, I got fed up of it and I drove like, way out of the city towards the south of the city,” he told the Neil Prendeville Show on Cork’s RedFM. "I’m not too sure how far I drove out, but I parked up in an estate and since then, I haven’t laid an eye on the car since. I just can’t find the estate where I left the car.” Kieran said it was his “first time ever having a night out in Cork” and he had “great craic” but when it was time to return home on Sunday morning, he could not remember where his car was parked. He said he was rushing at the time and he struggled to recall any landmarks that could help him with his search. "One of the boys stayed back with me and we drove around Cork, we were the guts of five hours driving around Cork, through estates and looking for this car. I put so much hours into finding this car, it’s actually the stupidest thing I’ve ever done. It’s just been a nightmare,” he said. His recent trip to Cork last weekend took him through “59 estates exactly” on his search. Kieran has spent every weekend since April 4 traipsing the streets of Cork looking for his car. Photo: Tristan O'Connor Today's News in 90 seconds - 23rd April 2025 "I took a name of every estate we were in. We were the whole day doing it,” he said. Kieran said the gardaí were “really helpful and really nice about it”, adding that they were “very professional about it, in fairness to them” when asked whether they found it funny that he had misplaced his car. He worked through what he could remember on air and the roads he took during his walk, adding that it has been a “nightmare”. The Wicklow man said it would “be the dream” for a local resident listening to the programme to identify the car. "I could put this to bed and get on with my life,” he said, adding that he would be prepared to give them a €200 reward “just to say thanks” for their help. The distance between the Boreenmanna Road and Tory Top Road. Source: Google Maps "I’m going to trust the good people of Cork. It’s the least I could do if they could find it, I’d be so grateful.” He said he was “obviously getting a load of abuse about it” from his friends, but that they have also been “so good to him” and have offered him lifts while his car was missing. Listeners to the show found the vehicle within minutes of his plea going out on air, with local woman Susan Maguire spotting the Skoda on Tory Top Road in Ballyphehane. All’s well that ends well for the slightly confused Kieran, who will finally be reunited with his Skoda, 19 days later, albeit his challenge now is to remember how to get out of the city and back to Wicklow.

ARK 21Shares leads Bitcoin ETF inflow surge with $267 million on record-setting day. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States witnessed their largest single-day net inflow since President Donald Trump returned to office in January. According to data from SpotOnChain, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $912.7 million on April 22. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) led with $267 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $253 million, while BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) added $193 million. Meanwhile, IBIT also saw intense trading activity on the day. Bitcoin analyst TraderT reported that the fund saw over $4 billion in volume on the day, making it one of the most-traded ETFs in the US market. Market analysts attribute the spike to a shift in investor sentiment, driven by broader market volatility and evolving macroeconomic conditions. The strong inflows suggest that institutional and retail players are once again turning to Bitcoin as a store of value amid economic uncertainty. Ethereum-focused ETFs also posted a positive turnaround after nine consecutive sessions of weak or negative flows. On April 22, these funds recorded a combined $38.8 million in net inflows, according to SpotOnChain data. Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF (FETH) accounted for most of the inflow, attracting $32.7 million. It was followed by Bitwise’s ETHW, which saw $6.1 million inflow, while other Ethereum ETFs recorded zero flows. While Ethereum ETF inflows were modest compared to Bitcoin, the move marks a cautious return of investor confidence. ETH products have faced sustained outflows in recent weeks due to tightening liquidity and uncertain market signals. Still, the renewed buying interest hints at optimism over Ethereum’s future, especially as the network prepares for key upgrades. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Enterprises Onboard AI Teammates Faster With NVIDIA NeMo Tools to Scale Employee Productivity
URL: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nemo-enterprises-ai-teammates-employee-productivity/
Time Published: 2025-04-23T13:02:26Z

An AI agent is only as accurate, relevant and timely as the data that powers it. Now generally available, NVIDIA NeMo microservices are helping enterprise IT quickly build AI teammates that tap into data flywheels to scale employee productivity. The microservices provide an end-to-end developer platform for creating state-of-the-art agentic AI systems and continually optimizing them with data flywheels informed by inference and business data, as well as user preferences. With a data flywheel, enterprise IT can onboard AI agents as digital teammates. These agents can tap into user interactions and data generated during AI inference to continuously improve model performance — turning usage into insight and insight into action. Without a constant stream of high-quality inputs — from databases, user interactions or real-world signals — an agent’s understanding can weaken, making responses less reliable and agents less productive. Maintaining and improving the models that power AI agents in production requires three types of data: inference data to gather insights and adapt to evolving data patterns, up-to-date business data to provide intelligence, and user feedback data to advise if the model and application are performing as expected. NeMo microservices help developers tap into these three data types. NeMo microservices speed AI agent development with end-to-end tools for curating, customizing, evaluating and guardrailing the models that drive their agents. NVIDIA NeMo microservices — including NeMo Customizer, NeMo Evaluator and NeMo Guardrails — can be used alongside NeMo Retriever and NeMo Curator to ease enterprises’ experiences building, optimizing and scaling AI agents through custom enterprise data flywheels. For example: With NeMo microservices, developers can build data flywheels that boost AI agent accuracy and efficiency. Deployed through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, NeMo microservices are easy to operate and can run on any accelerated computing infrastructure, on premises or in the cloud, with enterprise-grade security, stability and support. The microservices have become generally available at a time when enterprises are building large-scale multi-agent systems, where hundreds of specialized agents — with distinct goals and workflows — collaborate to tackle complex tasks as digital teammates, working alongside employees to assist, augment and accelerate work across functions. This enterprise-wide impact positions AI agents as a trillion-dollar opportunity — with applications spanning automated fraud detection, shopping assistants, predictive machine maintenance and document review — and underscores the critical role data flywheels play in transforming business data into actionable insights. NVIDIA partners and industry pioneers are using NeMo microservices to build responsive AI agent platforms so that digital teammates can help get more done. Working with Arize and Quantiphi, AT&T has built an advanced AI-powered agent using NVIDIA NeMo, designed to process a knowledge base of nearly 10,000 documents, refreshed weekly. The scalable, high-performance AI agent is fine-tuned for three key business priorities: speed, cost efficiency and accuracy — all increasingly critical as adoption scales. AT&T boosted AI agent accuracy by up to 40% using NeMo Customizer and Evaluator by fine-tuning a Mistral 7B model to help deliver personalized services, prevent fraud and optimize network performance. BlackRock is working with NeMo microservices for agentic AI capabilities in its Aladdin tech platform, which unifies the investment management process through a common data language. Teaming with Galileo, Cisco’s Outshift team is using NVIDIA NeMo microservices to power a coding assistant that delivers 40% fewer tool selection errors and achieves up to 10x faster response times. Nasdaq is accelerating its Nasdaq Gen AI Platform with NeMo Retriever microservices and NVIDIA NIM microservices. NeMo Retriever enhanced the platform’s search capabilities, leading to up to 30% improved accuracy and response times, in addition to cost savings. NeMo microservices support a broad range of popular open models, including Llama, the Microsoft Phi family of small language models, Google Gemma, Mistral and Llama Nemotron Ultra, currently the top open model on scientific reasoning, coding and complex math benchmarks. Meta has tapped NVIDIA NeMo microservices through new connectors for Meta Llamastack. Users can access the same capabilities — including Customizer, Evaluator and Guardrails — via APIs, enabling them to run the full suite of agent-building workflows within their environment. “With Llamastack integration, agent builders can implement data flywheels powered by NeMo microservices,” said Raghotham Murthy, software engineer, GenAI, at Meta. “This allows them to continuously optimize models to improve accuracy, boost efficiency and reduce total cost of ownership.” Leading AI software providers such as Cloudera, Datadog, Dataiku, DataRobot, DataStax, SuperAnnotate, Weights & Biases and more have integrated NeMo microservices into their platforms. Developers can use NeMo microservices in popular AI frameworks including CrewAI, Haystack by deepset, LangChain, LlamaIndex and Llamastack. Enterprises can build data flywheels with NeMo Retriever microservices using NVIDIA AI Data Platform offerings from NVIDIA-Certified Storage partners including DDN, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, NetApp, Nutanix, Pure Storage, VAST Data and WEKA. Leading enterprise platforms including Amdocs, Cadence, Cohesity, SAP, ServiceNow and Synopsys are using NeMo Retriever microservices in their AI agent solutions. Enterprises can run AI agents on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure, networking and software from leading system providers including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. Consulting giants including Accenture, Deloitte and EY are building AI agent platforms for enterprises using NeMo microservices. Developers can download NeMo microservices from the NVIDIA NGC catalog. The microservices can be deployed as part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise with extended-life software branches for API stability, proactive security remediation and enterprise-grade support.

UPDATED 09:00 EDT / APRIL 23 2025 by Kyt Dotson Nvidia Corp. today announced the general availability of NeMo microservices, a set of tools designed to assist developers get artificial intelligence agents up faster by tapping into AI inference and information systems at scale. Agents have become a focal point for creating “digital teammates” capable of driving workforce productivity for knowledge and service workers by taking orders, discovering information and doing proactive work. Unlike AI chatbots, agents can take autonomous actions with little or no human oversight but they need data to make accurate and efficient decisions as part of their reasoning. This can be particularly true for proprietary knowledge, which might be locked behind company firewalls or when using rapidly changing real-time information. “Without a constant stream of high-quality inputs — from databases, user interactions or real-world signals — an agent’s understanding can weaken, making responses less reliable, which makes agents less productive,” said Joey Conway, senior director of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia. To help developers rapidly build and deploy agents, Nvidia is releasing NeMo microservices, including Customizer, Evaluator, Guardrails, Retriever and Curator. They are designed to ease enterprise AI engineers’ experience building agentic AI experiences when scaling and accessing data. Customizer assists with large language model fine-tuning by providing up to 1.8 times higher training throughput. It provides an application programming interface that allows developers to curate models rapidly so they can fit a dataset before they deploy it. Evaluator simplifies the evaluation of AI models and workflows based on custom and industry benchmarks with just five API calls. Guardrails runs atop an AI model or agent to keep it from behaving in a way that is either unsafe or out of bounds. It can provide additional compliance with 1.4x efficiency and only a half-second more latency. Retriever, announced at GTC 2025, allows developers to build agents that can extract data from systems and accurately process it, enabling them to build complex AI data pipelines such as retrieval-augmented generation. “NeMo microservices are easy to operate and can run on any accelerated computing infrastructure, both on-premises and the cloud, while providing enterprise-grade security, stability and support,” added Conway. Nvidia designed the NeMo tools so that developers with general AI knowledge can access them via API calls to get AI agents up and running. Right now enterprises are beginning to build complex multi-agent systems where hundreds of expert agents collaborate to achieve unified goals while working alongside human teammates. NeMo microservices support a large number of popular open AI models, including Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, Microsoft Phi family of small language models, Google LLC’s Gemma and Mistral. Nvidia’s Llama Nemotron Ultra, currently ranking as the top open model on scientific reasoning, coding and complex math benchmarks, is also accessible through the microservices. Numerous leading AI service providers, including Cloudera Inc., Datadog Inc., Dataiku, DataRobot Inc., DataStax Inc., SuperAnnotate AI Inc. and Weights & Biases Inc., have included NeMo microservices in their platforms. Developers can start using these microservices in their processes today through popular AI frameworks such as CrewAI, Haystack by Deepset, LangChain, LlamaIndex and Llamastack. Using the new NeMo microservices, Nvidia partners and tech companies have built AI agent platforms and onboarded digital teammates to get more work done. For example, AT&T Inc. used NeMo Customizer and Evaluator to increase AI agent accuracy by fine-tuning a Mistral 7B model for personalized services, preventing fraud and optimizing network performance. And BlackRock Inc. is working with the microservices in its Aladdin tech platform to unify investment management through a common data language.

Last week Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met with Trump at the White House. They reportedly discussed Ukraine, defense spending, economy, space, energy —specifically Italy importing more US liquefied natural gas— and of course the US tariffs looming over EU imports. One item that really stood out, however, was Meloni’s insight into her brand of nationalism. Here she is speaking during the meeting with the press in the Oval Office: “Someone calls me a Western nationalist , I don’t know if that’s the right word, but I know that when I talk about the West, I’m not talking primarily about geographical space , but about civilization.” She added: “The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together, and we will keep on working on that.” On its face, it is contradictory. Either one is nationalistic or it subscribes to the western order headquartered in Washington. Yet, Meloni has been at the lead of squaring this circle in Europe over the past few years. As the 2023 elections in Italy approached with Meloni leading the polls, international media was in an uproar over the return of fascism to Rome. It was commonly assumed that she would lead a short-lived government that sparred with the EU and NATO. That belief was reasonably based on Meloni’s past statements critical of the supranational organizations, as well as the worn path from other political insurgencies of both the left and the right. And yet Meloni is still here, now among the five most durable of the Republic: And the party she leads maintains a steadily comfortable cushion in Italian polls. Part of that rests on feckless, Obama-inspired Partitico Democratico and the other is an increasingly disenchanted electorate. But it’s also reflective of Meloni’s realization that real nationalism wouldn’t play in Washington and Brussels and that she was destined to lose any struggle with NATO and the EU. She has instead sought to lead the European flank of “Western nationalism.” Others might call it “civilizational Europe.” To Quinn Slobodian, Meloni would be yet another “bastard of neoliberalism.” While her Brothers of Italy party struggles to crack 30 percent at home, she has become an international darling. Following the New York Times —the US paper of record— announcement at the beginning of 2024 that Meloni “solidifie[d] her credentials” and “put the European establishment at ease” the media has lauded her. She has been bestowed with the coveted title of Europe’s “Trump whisperer.” She was also well-received by the Biden administration and is chummy with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Even the Atlantic Council, the liberal internationalist establishment’s think tank, crowned her with its “Global Citizen” award last year. Meloni’s Western nationalism is the reason she is embraced so enthusiastically. What are the tenets of that philosophy? Let’s take a look. Neoliberalism Meloni and others on the “new right” like Argentine President Javier Milei and Trump himself like to tout themselves as rebels against the grating virtue signalling of the Davos cabal. They might be in style, but in substance they are a continuation. If neoliberalism is markets before people, Meloni and others on the “new” usually say they are for the people, nationalism — in Melon’s case, Western nationalism. Yet they have virtually zero plans to elevate the people over finance and tech—and in many cases seek to further empower the latter. Meloni has made much of her desire for more Italian babies and a strengthening of the family, but her economic policies do the opposite. Indeed, Italian youth continue to emigrate en masse due to the lack of decent paying jobs at home. The Meloni government has been overseeing a wave of privatizations, including critical communications infrastructure to CIA-connected private equity, and plans for more of the state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato, Poste Italiane, Monte dei Paschi bank and energy giant Eni. The firesale is necessitated by more tax cuts for the wealthy, as well as more than billions of euros Rome has burned through in order to address the loss of pipeline gas from Russia, which includes buying more US LNG. In 2023, Meloni chose May Day to announce her government’s promotion of short-term worker contracts, as well as the abolition of Italy’s basic income program, which provided the unemployed with an average of 567 euros a month. Despite the program providing a mild stimulus to the economy, Meloni said its elimination will force people back to work. “Where is the slump in the economy and employment?” she asked. She failed to mention that roughly 40 percent of Italian workers earn less than 10 euros an hour in the country where real wages have done this: Italy’s real wage misery: inflation-adjusted wages in 2023 were 4.4% lower than in 1990. Even real wages in Greek performed a little better. pic.twitter.com/rRN9QE4JE7 — Philipp Heimberger (@heimbergecon) July 3, 2024 So what of Meloni’s stated desire to “make the West great again”? It appears the tools to accomplish the job are the same that have been used for the three-plus decades. The cure for Italy’s ills is always more wage suppression, more market-friendly reforms, more social spending cuts, and more privatization. The country has actually followed the EU’s neoliberal reform policy rulebook much more closely than Berlin or Paris, and the answer when it inevitably doesn’t work, is always to double down. Meloni has done nothing to change this, and has embraced a future in which Italy is a deindustrialized imperial military outpost that doubles as a sunny Mediterranean corporate resort owned by (mostly) American capital. Immigration that Serves Capital Meloni is anti-immigrant except for those who are valuable for capital. In that case, they are welcome in the garden as a serf. It’s remarkably similar to the Trump-Silicon Valley vision for the US, even down to the use of foreign prisons. Meloni who rode to power two years ago based in part on strong opposition to illegal immigration and asylum. She quickly backed down on her deportations pledge, however, and ended up increasing the supply of cheap foreign labor at the request of Italian capital. She’s made a big show of it all, however, and now has a nearly $1 billion detention facility in Albania sitting empty after courts blocked the plan. They’re now being rebranded as repatriation hubs, in line with a recent EU proposal, which largely embraces Meloni’s vision. What the Albanian detention centers do is offshore the detention of immigrants and refugees outside of EU law while still allowing in those deemed valuable for capital. Meloni, after all, says she wants immigrants that contribute to the economy. ​​Meloni, despite railing against immigrants, is increasing the number of work permits to non-EU nationals in an effort to boost the supply of cheap labor. While Italians try to scrape by on low salaries, foreign workers can be paid even less. According to the 2020 IDOS Statistical Dossier on Immigration, the overall average monthly wage for foreign workers was 1,077 euros in 2019, which was 23.5 percent lower than that of Italians’ 1,408 euros. That gap is only widening in Italy, as well as the EU. In the agricultural sector in particular, migrant workers are subject to various forms of abuse and live and work in inhumane conditions. That is, of course, precisely why Italian oligarchs demanded a certain flow of immigrants. Italian big business welcomed the increase, but immediately said more will be needed to tackle a longstanding demographic decline. So Italians leave searching for higher wages and immigrants come in to fill low-wage jobs. Nationalism it ain’t – unless one conceives of the “western nation” as solely a profit extracting mechanism for oligarchs. When Meloni embraces the “Western nationalist” label and explains she’s talking about civilization, that’s the civilization she’s referring to. Atlanticism In Meloni’s speech last year accepting the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen award, one of the items she chose not to talk about was “the efforts the Italian government is doing to reform its country to make it, once again, a protagonist of the geopolitical chessboard.” By that she means American hegemony with Italy—and Europe— acting as the US sidekick. It’s difficult to know what reforms exactly she’s talking about, but we can make some educated guesses. A few hours ahead of Meloni’s meeting with Trump, her finance minister announced Italy would hit 2 percent of GDP on defense spending this year—up from 1.5 percent. There has been speculation that Rome would try some creative accounting by throwing expenditures like the Coast Guard into the defense category, but that looks to have been abandoned in favor of buying more American products. Of course, this will mean more of a budget squeeze, which only reinforces the argument that Italy must privatize state assets. New York-based private equity behemoth KKR, which includes former CIA director David Petraeus as a partner, snatched up the fixed-line network of Telecom Italia last year. Rome approved of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, taking a stake of more than 3 percent in defense and aerospace group Leonardo, which makes it the second largest shareholder after the state. Meloni is getting pushback on the major SpaceX deal she has championed. That potential deal would see Musk’s company provide security and encryption service to the Italian public sector. Meloni has also taken on a decidedly anti-China edge as well, withdrawing from Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative at the end of 2023. Add it all up, and Meloni simply represents different flavor of vassalage than elsewhere in Europe. While an adherent to the liberal rules-based order champions LGBTQ and immigration, the western nationalist opts for family values and rails against immigration. But the economic policies remain largely the same. It’s difficult to see a ton of daylight, for example, between Meloni and the Green madwoman in Berlin, Annalena Baerbock. She spent recent years openly arguing that Germany’s place was as overseer of America’s imperial order in Europe and junior partner in other global conflicts. Baerbock sold this as a “feminist” foreign policy; for Meloni it’s a civilizational struggle. Both are euphemisms for imperialism. We see where that got Germany, although it is a mindset that remains despite the replacement of Scholz and Baerbock with new faces. Italy, too, has also been hammered by the New Cold War and the EU’s severing itself from Russian pipeline gas, which has only added to the economic decay the country has been mired in since joining the common currency in the 1990s. Meloni and her “western nationalism” being welcome in the European halls of power alongside those still clinging to their respectable liberal rules-based order, is likely to only accelerate these trends as the very mixture of Meloni’s style of nationalism and neoliberalism mean that she and the country she currently leads will be sold up the river to further the goals of Western capital. Openly offering Italy up as a “protagonist” piece to be used by the US on the geopolitical chessboard should be setting off alarm bells in Italy. A look at the history of such protagonist American allies would show that Meloni and Italy are soon going to get burned—even if she’s currently the “Trump whisperer.” The Atlantic Council’s “Global Citizen Award”…a bureaucrat who cares only about 1/8th of the globe…one couldnt make this up… Nope. They care only about 1% of the 1/8th of the globe. the Golden Ten Million. I have no statistics but I would guess in Germany agriculture without foreign (mostly undocumented) labour would break down. Same for meat-processing industry. The truly blue-collar work is not even done by natives when they´re poor. And while sociology and left think tanks used to have models on how to organize labour in a democratic society in a meaningful and just way I have the impression the insight and demands to transform those into genuine policies by unions and left parties thereof has been totally abandoned. Thanks for this great piece. I guess I´m gonna pester my Italian friends with it… p.s. We did have discussions over German native Eike Schmidt who had been the director of the Uffizi in Florence until last year. He then planned to run as Florence mayor supported by right-wing parties. (I believe there was even discussion over Schmidt as cultural minister under Meloni.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eike_Schmidt When Meloni won everyone demanded that Schmidt ought to deny any cooperation with her being a “fascist”. I of course doubted that approach. We came to no conclusion. I know too little of the minutes of the preceding 10 years in Italian politics to be able to judge if there were major differences between Meloni and here social democratic predecessors to “justify” such a move to oppose as cultural manager beyond self-serving. When does activism serve the people, when does it not? Schmidt lost. His opponent, Sara Funaro had a Jewish father. So, of course, The Times of Israel gets involved. But she also has not placed Judaism or Israel at the center of her career, instead trying to respond to hate against her with a poker face and framing her public persona around her family’s deep roots in the Tuscan city.> Sounds like she’s dealing with antisemitism, instead of responding to her German opponent, with no “deep roots” in Florence. On Israel “Florence has always been a city of peace and dialogue and does not tolerate divisive messages that incite hatred,” she said at the time. “Always”? Dante might have had a different opinion. For the future “Serving as the mayor of Florence opens up many opportunities,” said Pini. “All Florence mayors went on doing something at the national or international level. Renzi? Thank you, Conor. Just a bit off topic from Blighty: Last December, to commemorate Labour’s first six months in power (or should that be in office, but not in power), the Financial Times, including a friend on the City team, interviewed some of the back room staff and included some settling of scores. Not all of the material was published as the FT would like to keep lines of communication open. Two things struck, alarmed even, my friend as they are married to the child of immigrants and would like to start a family. Mandelson’s protege and the brains behind Starmer, Cork born and raised and Fine Gael stalwart Morgan McSweeney, said Labour would not be outflanked from the right and looked forward to and even relished fighting (Farage’s) Reform on their turf, Labour thinks the latter part of this decade and next will be dominated by Vance, Weidel (that was before the German federal elections), Le Pen (that was before the court case) and Meloni, so Starmer wants and needs to be on (their) side, Labour thinks the left and even centre have nowhere to go, and (the bit which alarmed my friend) would scapegoat immigrants and other minorities. I think Italy may get burned, but Meloni won’t be. For example, former Finnish PM Sanne Marin is employed by Blair and lives in style in London. The likes of Baerbock, Kallas, von der Leyen (descendant of English gentry) and Sandu can look forward to that retirement from front line politics. The sons of Radek Sikorski and Anne Apfelbaum went to Eton and Oxford and divide their time between London, the Cotswolds and NYC. This is the lifestyle that the US elite can offer them, so why not betray one’s country. “… While an adherent to the liberal rules-based order champions LGBTQ and immigration, the western nationalist opts for family values and rails against immigration. But the economic policies remain largely the same. It’s difficult to see a ton of daylight, for example, between Meloni and the Green madwoman in Berlin, Annalena Baerbock. She spent recent years openly arguing that Germany’s place was as overseer of America’s imperial order in Europe and junior partner in other global conflicts. Baerbock sold this as a “feminist” foreign policy; for Meloni it’s a civilizational struggle. Both are euphemisms for imperialism.” Yes. This is the key point everywhere in the West as far as I can tell. These increasingly “polarized” political camps are mainly sheep-herding mechanisms for different segments of the “electorate,” while the trajectories of both foreign and domestic policy continue on steadily through the administrations of “Democrats” or “Republicans,” “Socialists” or “Conservatives,” the “Left” or the “Right,” etc. As Conor emphasizes here and has noted before, there is a “compatible right” just as there is a “compatible left” in the West. The political rhetoric differs; the policies remain the same. Wowsers. That graphic. Berlusconi, Craxi, Renzi, Meloni. Every one of them successful postmodern politicians — purveyors of the big nothing. One might argue, though, that Meloni is the most intelligent and the least corrupt. Berlusconi represented (and his Forza Italia still represents) the big bourgeoisie of Lombardy and the Veneto. Craxi is the politician who makes Italians shake their heads: “Bettino should have known better.” Renzi is the Hillary Clinton of Italy, although slightly more charming: He’s office politics, self-promotion, and grift, grift, grift. The most important part of this excellent article is that Italian politics isn’t all that hard to understand. The Anglosphere likes to go on about an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a mozzarella, but there is no mystery of how Italian politics works, how the parties align, and how Italian politicians have damaged the social state to comply with directives from the EU. To wit: “She failed to mention that roughly 40 percent of Italian workers earn less than 10 euros an hour in the country where real wages have … [declined over the course of the past thirty years].” Frankly, I am appalled by how little Italians make. Further, because minimum wage is decided by negotiations by economic sector and not by a national law, the concept of a minimum wage is rickety. Fortunately, workplace protections are still stronger in Italy than in “at-will employee” U S of A. I will be watching the results of the referendums to be held on 8 / 9 June to repeal the so-called Jobs Act and to change citizenship requirements to be less reliant on jus sanguinis (inherited citizenship). Further, the argument that the Western industrial countries aren’t competitive on wages doesn’t hold up when one looks at how low Italian wages are. Instead, it’s the war on the working class. Heck, even Italian medical doctors don’t make what a U.S. medical doctor makes. As to “Western nationalism,” which must come out of the Frodo-Atreju-Gollum-Tolkien wing of the Fratelli d’Italia, I am reminded of Meloni’s insistence on the use of the word Nazione for Italy. Italy is many things, but it is too varied a country to be a nazione. For most Italians, it is Il Paese. The country. Nation is a top-down idea, a fantasy of hierarchy. Here in the Undisclosed Region, mon petit pays, society is from the ground up — a country of cows, bees, chocolate, educution, an amazing work ethic, and religion in the style of Pope Francis. Nation, indeed. Thank you, DJG. I have noticed the Italians moving to Mauritius. They tend to work in textiles, hotels and catering, but some are in finance and technology. There are a dozen families, split evenly between young and retirees, in my small town on the west coast. We have had Italian neighbours, two different families, for a dozen years. With regard to Renzi, he’s the darling of British centrists. They know nothing about him apart from the marketing by the MSM. From your comments, it seems that many people from Europe are moving to Mauritius. Any push-back from the local population against that form of immigration? And how much total population can Mauritius comfortably host? Thank you. There’s very little evidence of push back other than for environmental reasons, insufficient water / water infrastructure and loss of farm land, and, but not solely due to much better paid foreigners, house prices going up. Many, if not most, Mauritians have family and friends abroad, so they are relaxed. Also, there are no indigenous Mauritians. Migrants are quite safe and most welcome there. There aren’t enough Mauritians, especially with skills. DJG, What are your thoughts about the impact on Italy of Hillary Clinton? She is linked to the downfall of Muammar Khadaffi. His efforts held back the wave of immigration through Lampedusa. I wouldn’t worry too much about the announcements of Meloni. She is kinda like the AOC of the EU. She too was elected on the basis of being a reformer and once in she ran up the Jolly Roger and showed her true colours. That threat that Ursula made against her before her election about the EU having the tools to use to bring her in line was totally unnecessary. With Biden in she trimmed Italy’s sails to what he wanted as much as she could and even rescued him when he stared to wander away from that group of EU leaders. But then the winds of change came along with the election of Donald Trump and she jumped a plane to meet with him for several hours in Mar-a-Lago back in January. And that is the key with her. She will always align herself with the most powerful figure at any particular time in order to ensure her own political survival. If Putin was made head of the EU tomorrow I’m sure that she would jump the next plane to Moscow to talk to him about Italy’s historical ties to Russia. Thank you, Rev. Having worked in Russia for HSBC twenty years ago, I noticed how much of the equipment for factories and parts for vehicles came from Italy. Italy was then and is to some extent now a serious competitor for Germany, but China is eclipsing the pair. The problem for the Western mindset in general, is that it is very node oriented, from atoms to individuals, in a reality that is the interplay between nodes and networks. The essence of the node is synchronization, everything on the same wavelength, functioning as one. While the essence of the network is harmonization. Everything interacting, with an overall balance. “Entangled particles.” So when it’s just the node, it becomes a feedback loop with no circuit breakers. Microphone up to the speaker, shriek going parabolic. Echo chamber. Like Israel. The eventual consequence is when it all goes super nova and collapses into the vortex in the middle. Black hole. If they ditched the euphemisms and just explained what they believe about the way the world works, they’d sound more coherent. Imagine Meloni pledging her allegiance to the Empire, waxing rhapsodic about her imperial patriotism, and exclaiming how true and just it is that the lesser orders don’t get a say in how it’s run. It might take less energy than the constant stream of P.R. talk, which I know politicians enjoy, somewhat sadistically. Is it just me or is this basically another slight variant of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” with somewhat different costuming? And wasn’t even that basically a way to make xenophobia intellectually respectable again? So Italians leave searching for higher wages and immigrants come in to fill low-wage jobs. This is what happened in the great Roman Empire. Brave Roman citizens left Rome to expand abroad, and vice versa, the conquered people went to Rome, the economic center of the city. I think Meloni is more of a traditionalist than Mussolini. The chart by Philipp Heimberger is a devastating indictment of Italy’s economic (mis-)management over the past 30 years. Even worse than Greece. 1987’s Il Sorpasso is just a distant memory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_sorpasso_(economics) Thank you and well said. I have followed Heimberger’s work for years. Some years ago, he was invited to meetings in Rome and Brussels to discuss his analysis. Unfortunately, the neoliberal Italian government, which set up the meetings, did not support his findings. Young Italians are still coming to the UK. One hears from them of their peers in Germany and Netherlands. It’s so sad that Italy,which once had a strong communist/leftist movement, now only has these pathetic centrist parties. This, no one to challenge Meloni. I thought 5 states movement might make an impact, but did not happen. They gave up their sovereignty when they joined the euro. Your email address will not be published.

The new shape of climate-conscious investing. Can we invest our way out of the climate crisis? That’s the question we started this series with, and in this episode, we try to answer that question. So far, we’ve been talking about the trillions of dollars of investor capital that could fund climate solutions or keep fueling the crisis. But what about our own money? What can we as individuals do to protect our savings from climate risk and not contribute to the problem? One place where you might have more power than you think is in your retirement savings. By taking a closer look at how you invest that money, you could potentially reduce your carbon impact more than going vegan, putting solar on your roof or buying an electric car. And while environmental, social and governance investing might be dead — or deeply wounded — some governments aren’t backing off climate-conscious investing. New York City has developed an aggressive investing strategy to accelerate its energy transition; it’s invested billions of dollars in climate solutions, and it’s divesting from some fossil fuel companies. In this episode, we look at the future of climate-conscious investing. Host Amy Scott pops the hood of her own retirement investments and shows you how you can too. We also visit a battery storage farm in the Bronx to see how New York City is leveraging its shareholder power to fund climate solutions. Finally, we look at a phenomenon that has emerged in the wake of the ESG backlash — something called “greenhushing.” Note: Marketplace podcasts are meant to be heard, with emphasis, tone and audio elements a transcript can’t capture. Transcripts are generated using a combination of automated software and human transcribers, and may contain errors. Please check the corresponding audio before quoting it. Amy Scott: If I'm an investor, you know, worried about the climate crisis, what kind of impact do my retirement savings have? Alex Wright-Gladstein: It turns out that moving your investments to a climate friendly investment option is the single most impactful thing that the average American can do for climate change. Amy Scott: We've been talking so far this season about other people's money, the trillions of dollars of investor capital that can fund climate solutions or keep fueling the crisis. But what about you and me? What can we as individuals do to protect our savings from climate risk and not contribute to the problem? To find out, I called up Alex Wright-Gladstein. She's the founder and CEO of Sphere, a company focused on climate friendly investing, and Alex says there's a lot of invisible power in our retirement portfolios. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It turns out it's more impactful than the combination of going vegan, never flying again, driving an electric car, putting solar on your house. Amy Scott: Sphere has a tool online where you can look up the carbon impact of your workplace retirement plan. I type in Marketplace's parent company. Ooh, $19 million. This is how much American Public Media Group employees have invested in fossil fuel companies through their retirement savings plan. And scroll through the report, which is based on tax filings from 2021. On average, about $15,700 per employee, and then it compares us to some other companies. So Walmart is similar. Apple is actually lower, 8.1%, but of course, as that's a percentage, the actual money would be significantly more. If my employer divested from fossil fuels, the website tells me, it would be like taking 7800 cars off the road each year. Anyone listening in HR? So that's my workplace as a whole. For a more granular look, Alex points me to another website called fossilfreefunds.org, where I can enter the ticker symbols for the individual funds I'm invested in. All right, so... And that's when things get a bit grimmer. Fidelity international index. I'm going to look up that. Ooh, it gets an F. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Yeah. Amy Scott: Oh shoot. Fossil fuel exposure of 10.33% places the fund in the F tier. Oof, okay. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It's invested in companies including Shell and Total and BP, etc. Amy Scott: Alex tries to reassure me. Alex Wright-Gladstein: I will say that's pretty standard for any international index fund. Amy Scott: Okay… I poke around a bit more, try out a few more index funds that I have. It doesn't get much better. A D is as good as it gets. Ouch. Alex says, lately, more people are looking for greener alternatives. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Especially since the most recent election, I think people realized they can't rely on the government to save us when it comes to climate change, and so they've been turning to what they can do. Amy Scott: That raises a really important question, which is kind of the question that is overarching our series, can we invest our way out of the climate crisis? Alex Wright-Gladstein: I believe the answer is yes. I really do believe that this is the most impactful thing that we can do to turn around climate change, and we absolutely can invest our way out of the crisis. Amy Scott: I'm Amy Scott. This is How We Survive. Last episode, we looked back at the origins of the ESG backlash. In this episode, we look forward to the future of climate-conscious investing, how we as individuals can make a difference with our own retirement savings, and how the country's largest city is using its shareholder power to accelerate the energy transition. While that acronym ESG might be dead or deeply wounded, the principles behind it live on. This is episode three, reincarnation. Before she started Sphere, Alex Wright-Gladstein was running a clean tech company and wanted to offer her employees a climate-friendly option in their retirement plan. But she had a hard time finding any. Alex Wright-Gladstein: And when I finally got offered some options by our 401K advisors, they were offering ESG options. And I had never heard the term ESG before. I didn't know what it meant, but I looked up the funds, and I saw that they were invested in fossil fuel companies. And I was like, Okay, I don't know what ESG means, but I don't think it means climate friendly. Amy Scott: Remember, the climate part of ESG is concerned with climate risk, how companies are preparing for the risks the climate crisis might pose, not necessarily how good they are for the environment. So Alex decided to create her own index fund, the Sphere 500 Climate Fund. Alex Wright-Gladstein: The key thing we do is exclude fossil fuel companies. Amy Scott: The Sphere 500 is made up of the top 500 companies in the US by market value, minus fossil fuel companies. It also excludes some other businesses, like tobacco, private prisons, and weapons manufacturers. Alex says Sphere also votes its shares in favor of climate friendly proposals, which she says is rare for traditional fund managers. Alex Wright-Gladstein: Most people don't think about this, but we're having our shares voted on our behalf by fund managers who are voting against climate related shareholder proposals 98% of the time. Amy Scott: Alex says none of this means investors lose out on returns. The Sphere 500 has low fees, similar to any S&P 500 index fund, and it performs about as well. Alex Wright-Gladstein: It's really brilliant how really it's the fossil fuel industry and the fossil fuel lobby has framed this as, Well, you gotta choose between investing with your progressive values or investing for good returns, when data actually shows that you don't have to choose. You can do both. Amy Scott: Today, Sphere's fund is available in more than 200 401K plans, but not to public retirees in Texas. Remember the blacklist we talked about last episode? Sphere's fund is on that list, meaning Texas pension funds can't invest in it. Alex says Sphere protested the decision. Alex Wright-Gladstein: We said, Yes, we care about climate change, but look, here are all the financial reasons that we're excluding fossil fuels. We showed how they've been the worst performers of the economy over the past 10, 15, 20 years. We showed how volatile the industry is, and how if you want to avoid that volatility, it can make sense to exclude them. Amy Scott: But it stayed on the blacklist. Now the company is part of a lawsuit challenging the state's anti-ESG law on constitutional grounds. But while Texas and a growing number of states have sought to outlaw climate-conscious investing, other governments are taking the opposite approach, like New York City. How did someone manage to get graffiti on that building? That's amazing. Brad Lander: That is impressive. Amy Scott: From a high rise in Manhattan's financial district, I'm taking in the view of the New York Harbor with Brad Lander, controller of New York City. Brad Lander: We are in Seven World Trade Center overlooking Brooklyn and Queens and Long Island and lower Manhattan. It's a gorgeous view this morning. Amy Scott: As the city's chief financial officer, he monitors the health of its finances and its public pension funds, money belonging to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers living in the boroughs surrounding us. Brad Lander: You can see what a harbor city it is. You know, it's hard not to come up here and think about what Superstorm Sandy did and how long we have to go to be ready. Amy Scott: In 2012, New York City was caught by surprise when Superstorm Sandy walloped the East Coast. It caused massive flooding in the city and an estimated $19 billion in damage. 52 people died. Brad Lander: Everyone was impacted. Of course, people in communities that were were flooded and displaced were most directly impacted. The subways were out for a few days, and the power was out and you couldn't get gasoline into the gas terminal so you couldn't buy gas in the gas stations. Amy Scott: It was a long road to recovery, and Controller Lander says it was a wake up call. Brad Lander: So it really did spark something in the city. Amy Scott: So in the aftermath of the storm, New York decided to take action. The state and the city are now working on slashing emissions and making buildings more efficient, and taking a hard look at their investments. Brad Lander: If we don't collectively achieve decarbonization goals, it's not only going to cost lives like it did in Superstorm Sandy, it's going to cost trillions of dollars, and we'll feel the impact of that in our funds. Amy Scott: There's the physical risk to investments from extreme weather and sea level rise, but also, so called transition risk, from the shift to a low carbon economy. You don't want a portfolio full of fossil fuel stocks when everyone's driving an EV. Brad Lander: So we've adopted one of the most ambitious Net Zero implementation plans, one of the boldest climate transition investing strategies of any US public pension fund. Amy Scott: That strategy involves divesting from some fossil fuel companies and engaging other companies, like utilities, to pressure them to reduce emissions. Not everyone is happy with that approach. A few years ago, some employees filed a lawsuit accusing the city's pension plans of a breach of fiduciary duty for divesting from fossil fuels. Brad Lander: But the judge dismissed the case because their pensions are being paid, our returns are good, and the judge concluded that they lack standing. Amy Scott: In fact, he says last year, returns were 10%, beating most of the system's public sector peers. The city is also investing its pension funds in climate solutions. Brad Lander: We increased our clean energy and climate transition investments now to over $11 billion in some amazing companies. Amy Scott: One of those companies is Nine Dot Energy. Yeah, we made it. Adam Cohen: Our little corner of the northeast Bronx. Amy Scott: Pretty cool. I've never been up here. In a fenced in gravel lot sandwiched between an elementary school and a big shopping center, I meet up with co-founder, Adam Cohen. All right, you want to show us around? Adam Cohen: Sure. Amy Scott: With his navy hoodie, he looks the part of a young entrepreneur. Adam Cohen: We can walk this way. Amy Scott: We walk down a row of big gray cabinets. Adam Cohen: So these are batteries. These are big batteries. Amy Scott: Can you unlock one of those cages for us or no? Adam Cohen: No. Amy Scott: What would happen? Voice 1: A really painful death. No, I'm just kidding. Adam Cohen: No, nothing. Nothing would happen. Amy Scott: These cabinets hold a combined three megawatts of battery storage. Nine Dot estimates that's enough to power about 3000 New York City households for four hours on a hot summer day. The batteries sit here all charged up with energy from the power lines overhead. Adam Cohen: And then hold that power until the utility says, Please give it back. Amy Scott: When the grid for the city gets stressed, maybe it's an especially hot summer day and everyone's running their AC, the city utility, Con Ed, can call on Nine Dot to help relieve that stress. Adam Cohen: So last summer, it was called half a dozen times, so in the peak of the peak days. Amy Scott: Enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a combined 24 metric tons. That's the equivalent of 9000 car trips on the Cross Bronx Expressway. Nine Dot's hope is that more of these battery storage farms can be built all over the city, reducing the reliance on dirty power plants and eventually helping the grid transition to renewable sources. Adam Cohen: The sun only shines when nature tells it to, the wind only blows when nature tells it to, but people use electricity when they decide to, and so a battery helps mediate that process. It pulls in the extra power when it's available and then we put it back out when people call for it. Amy Scott: Nine Dot is still in growth mode, but Brad Lander and the city of New York hope the investment pays off, not just for retirees, but for future generations, like the kids at the school right across the street from the battery farm. Virtue Onoja: I'm definitely an artist. One thing about me, I'm definitely an artist. Amy Scott: Virtue Onoja is a sixth grader who attended the Bronx Charter School for Better Learning II. Two years ago, Nine Dot invited students to paint a mural along the outside of the fence with a local artist. Virtue Onoja: Down over here, I did like most stuff over here. I drew like most of the park and the trees. Amy Scott: Walking me up and down the fence, Virtue points out some of her drawings. Virtue Onoja: I drew a clear blue sky, no pollution, no nothing. Beautiful flowers, beautiful yellow flowers and the sun. Amy Scott: There are also drawings of windmills and electric school buses. It's a hopeful imagining of the future that the city is trying to invest into reality. But while New York is loudly and proudly pushing ahead, another phenomenon has emerged in the wake of the ESG backlash. Bruce Usher: I expect the next four years are going to be a period of what we call green hushing. Amy Scott: Coming up after the break. [BREAK] Amy Scott: Just a few weeks ago reading the news, I noticed Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, was out with his latest open letter. It's a wide ranging essay touching on the democratization of investing, infrastructure and the retirement savings crisis. In 27 pages, no mentions of ESG, no surprise, or climate change. There was one mention of decarbonization in reference to China. Instead, he argued for energy pragmatism. That's something he talked about recently as keynote speaker at one of the largest oil and gas conferences in the world. Larry Fink: I think across the board, we have to think about power and energy in a pragmatic way. When the whole conversation, including some of my CEO letters, back a few years back when we talked about that we're going to have to focus on decarbonization. I still believe that, but I also caution that any decarbonizing technology right now is highly inflationary. Amy Scott: As in, too expensive. Larry Fink: We have to be working side by side in trying to find ways of reducing the costs of wind and solar and other energy sources. But let's be clear, we're going to be dependent on dispatchable power for a long, long time. Amy Scott: Dispatchable power meaning sources that can be turned on or off and still rely heavily on fossil fuels. Gone is the urgency from Fink's previous letters. And to be fair, the global situation has changed. Russia's invasion of Ukraine increased demand for US natural gas. The explosion of AI requires more and more energy, and the United States has elected a pro-fossil fuel president who is hostile to the energy transition and actively trying to stop it. All of these factors, along with the ESG backlash, have led investors to push climate risk off the main stage and into the wings. Bruce Usher: I expect the next four years are going to be a period of what we call green hushing. Amy Scott: This is Bruce Usher at the Columbia Business School. We heard from him in the first episode about the origins of ESG. You've heard of greenwashing, where companies make misleading claims about how eco-friendly they are. Bruce says, with green hushing... Bruce Usher: Businesses are not talking about what they're doing on climate change for political reasons, or they just feel there's not that, you know, it's not advantageous for them to talk about it. But in fact, the business activity may not change that much. If renewable energy is profitable, people will keep doing renewable energy. If, if selling electric vehicles is successful, they'll keep selling electric vehicles. Amy Scott: So while BlackRock may not talk so much about ESG, Bruce says phrases like transition finance have taken its place. Bruce Usher: Transition finance is financing the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energies. It's very similar investing. The point is that companies are going to change what they say, based on the political temperature, but at the end of the day, if there's a profitable business in these industries, they will continue to invest in them. Amy Scott: I asked Jason Isaac about this. Remember from last episode, he was the architect of the original anti-ESG law in Texas. Amy Scott: So have you heard the term green hushing? Jason Isaac: I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Jason agrees, even after the Texas law passed, he's not convinced financial firms have changed their ways. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. They're virtue signaling to Republican or red states that, oh, we're getting out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. We're getting out of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. But in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. We're going to continue to work towards net zero and decarbonization in alignment with the Paris Accords. Amy Scott: Meanwhile, ESG is still popular in Europe and Canada and other parts of the world, but there's no question Jason's and others' efforts have had a chilling effect. In the past two years, investors have pulled more money out of US ESG funds than they've put in, according to Morningstar. So many firms have withdrawn from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative it suspended activities. And Brad Lander, New York City controller, says that matters. Brad Lander: It is deeply disappointing the ways that asset managers in general including BlackRock and large financial institutions have walked back from what they know is wise fiduciary investing. This is an urgent crisis. If we had 100 years for the energy transition that we have to make, it might be a different story. But no, if you know climate risk is financial risk, and you believe it's your fiduciary duty to invest in ways that are attentive to risk, you've got to have the courage to stand up and say so. Amy Scott: We started this season with a question, was I naive to think Wall Street might actually save us from the climate crisis? And the answer is, yeah, a little bit. But the reality is also more complicated than I realized. These are crucial years to be slow pedaling climate action, the damage is very real. But as inaction becomes more and more costly, investors seeking profits and ways to manage their risks from climate change, will continue to fund solutions, whatever their motivations. Like it or not, nothing motivates people like money. Thanks for listening.

Title: Why is bitcoin up so much right now

Key Points Institutional Adoption Bitcoin’s price has been boosted by increased institutional interest, especially through the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These ETFs, like BlackRock’s, have made it easier for investors to buy Bitcoin, with assets under management expected to reach over $250 billion by 2025 (Forbes). This has broadened its appeal to mainstream and institutional investors, driving up demand. Regulatory and Political Influence The re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024 has created a pro-crypto environment. Trump’s policies, including plans for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and replacing SEC Chair Gary Gensler with a more crypto-friendly appointee, have boosted investor confidence (CNBC). Regulatory optimism globally, with clearer frameworks expected in 2025, has also supported the price surge. Macroeconomic Factors Lower interest rates, with major central banks expected to cut rates in 2025, have made Bitcoin more attractive as a risk-on asset. The Federal Reserve’s dovish signals, including potential rate cuts, have reduced the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin, enhancing its appeal as an inflation hedge (Euronews). Supply and Demand Dynamics The April 2024 halving reduced Bitcoin’s supply by lowering miner rewards, historically leading to price increases due to scarcity. Combined with sustained demand, especially from institutions, this has contributed to the current high price (Swan Bitcoin). Comprehensive Analysis of Bitcoin’s Price Surge as of April 23, 2025 This analysis provides a detailed examination of the factors contributing to Bitcoin’s recent price surge, offering insights for investors, analysts, and enthusiasts. The information is synthesized from recent articles and market analyses, ensuring a thorough understanding of the current market dynamics as of 12:50 PM +07 on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. Background and Context Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has experienced a remarkable rally, reaching a new all-time high of over $93,000 in recent months, as reported by [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). This surge aligns with historical patterns, particularly the four-year market cycle, and is influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic, regulatory, and technical factors. The following sections detail these drivers, supported by data and expert insights. Key Drivers of the Price Surge Institutional Adoption and Bitcoin ETFs One of the most significant catalysts for Bitcoin’s price increase is the surge in institutional adoption, particularly through the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in 2024. These ETFs, which began trading in January 2024, have broadened Bitcoin’s appeal to mainstream investors, with expected assets under management (AUM) projected to cross $250 billion by 2025, as noted by CNBC. The increased demand from ETFs, coupled with fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors, has improved liquidity and potentially contributed to overvaluation, as discussed in [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). This institutional participation is evident in the rising BTC supply among long-term holders, with waning spending pressure, as highlighted by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Regulatory Developments and Political Influence Regulatory clarity and favorable policies have significantly boosted Bitcoin’s price. The re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024, with his pro-crypto platform, has been a major driver. Trump vowed to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who stepped down in January 2025, and indicated plans for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve using seized funds, as reported by CNBC. This shift towards a more favorable regulatory environment is expected to boost institutional flows, with experts anticipating increased adoption by corporations and nation-states, including five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, according to [CNBC]([invalid url, do not cite]). Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic trends, particularly the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, have played a crucial role. Earlier in 2025, the Fed signaled dovish policies, expecting to cut interest rates twice, and kept the benchmark rate on hold while acknowledging tariff-driven inflation as “transitory,” as reported by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, making it an attractive inflation hedge. This is supported by Bitcoin’s 83% correlation with global liquidity, as noted in [Finance Magnates]([invalid url, do not cite]), amid rising U.S. debt and economic uncertainties. Bitcoin Halving and Supply Dynamics The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which reduced miner rewards, has historically been a bullish trigger for prices. This event, occurring every four years, reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, increasing scarcity and supporting price appreciation. Historical data shows post-halving price increases, such as reaching $1,100 in November 2013 and $64,000 in April 2021, as discussed in Swan Bitcoin. The 2024 halving, combined with sustained demand, has contributed to the current bull run, as noted by [CNBC]([invalid url, do not cite]). Market Sentiment and Historical Cycles The crypto market is currently in a growth phase, potentially peaking between 2024 and 2025, aligning with the historical four-year market cycle, as per [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Positive news, such as regulatory acceptance and technological advancements, has created a bullish sentiment, while social media and online forums have influenced retail investor decisions, as discussed in [OSL]([invalid url, do not cite]). Fear of missing out (FOMO) has led to sudden buying surges, further driving prices, while fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can trigger sell-offs, though current sentiment remains optimistic. Expert Predictions and Market Outlook Experts have made bullish predictions, adding to the market’s upward momentum. Anthony Scaramucci predicts Bitcoin could reach $170,000 in the next year, Michael Saylor highlights a supply shock post-halving, and Tom Lee forecasts $150,000 short-term and $500,000 in five years, as reported by [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Digital Coin Price estimates an average of $210,644.67 in 2025, with a peak at $230,617.59, while Wallet Investor projects $103,675 in one year and $196,072 in five years. These predictions, while speculative, reflect strong market fundamentals and growing institutional trust. Controversies and Bearish Concerns Despite the bullish outlook, there are concerns, including Bitcoin’s high energy consumption and evolving anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, as noted in [Changelly]([invalid url, do not cite]). Some experts, like Mike McGlone from Bloomberg Intelligence, predict potential corrections, with Bitcoin dropping 20% in 2025 while gold surged 16%, as reported by [Finance Magnates]([invalid url, do not cite]). However, these bearish views are not the consensus, with most analysts expecting continued growth due to institutional support. Technical Analysis and Price Movements Technical indicators also support the bullish trend. Based on data from April 22, 2025, Bitcoin’s 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is expected to rise to $93,964 by May 22, 2025, and the 50-day SMA to $104,173, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 58.80 indicating a neutral position, as per [CoinCodex]([invalid url, do not cite]). Bitcoin tested the lower trendline of an ascending channel pattern in March 2025, leading to bounces of 7.50%, 6.60%, and 7.60%, facing resistance at $87,830, as reported by [Cointelegraph]([invalid url, do not cite]). Comparative Performance Bitcoin has appreciated faster than the S&P 500 and gold, currently at 10% of gold’s market cap, with potential to reach 20% in 2025 and 25% long-term, equating to $250,000, as per CNBC. This performance underscores its role as a reserve asset, with increasing recognition through exchange-traded products (ETPs) and adoption trends. Detailed Breakdown of Factors Conclusion Bitcoin’s price surge as of April 23, 2025, is a result of institutional adoption, favorable regulations, macroeconomic trends, the April 2024 halving, and bullish market sentiment. While controversies like environmental impact exist, the consensus leans towards continued growth, supported by expert predictions and technical indicators. Investors should remain cautious of potential corrections, but the current trajectory suggests a robust bull run. Key Citations Key Points Recent Price Surge Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase, reaching over $93,000 recently, likely due to increased demand from institutional investors and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. These ETFs, expected to manage over $250 billion by 2025, have broadened Bitcoin’s appeal to mainstream investors. Regulatory and Political Influence Favorable regulatory developments, especially under the new U.S. administration following Donald Trump’s re-election, have boosted investor confidence.

Title: Bitcoin Rises as BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark, Bitwise and Other Whales Continue BTC Accumulation Spree

Bitcoin (BTC) has tagged the $91,500 level for the first time since March 7th as institutional holdings of the flagship crypto asset enjoy a significant boost. According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain, BlackRock and several other large US institutions have upped their Bitcoin stacks to back their BTC-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Says Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, “BTC is back to $90,000. Fidelity, BlackRock, ARK Invest, Bitwise are all accumulating BTC.” According to crypto data aggregator SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs saw $381 million in flows on Monday, April 21, with none of the 12 ETFs seeing net outflows. The flows are the largest recorded since January 30. However, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs haven’t seen the same amount of demand. According to SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs have suffered net outflows for the majority of days since mid-February, including today.

Title: Elon Musk news: What happens to Tesla stock if index funds stop buying it?

You may as well, along with plenty of people you know who may despise Elon Musk. My contribution to Musk’s biggest company is about $26 of the roughly $2,000 per month I aim to send to an index fund that tracks more or less the entire U.S. stock market. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the market, and so it accounts for 1.31 percent of my investment. (As a proper adherent to the Boglehead strategy I also get my little piece of 3,561 other companies.) Twenty-six bucks a month adds up in eye-watering fashion when millions of people send their investment dollars into this type of fund. Tesla has lots of retail investors who just like owning Tesla stock. (I once sat in an Uber and watched my driver monitor Tesla’s intraday movements on a mounted phone while the car was moving, a scene I wish I was making up for this story.) Even still, institutions hold most of Tesla’s stock. Three huge ones—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—collectively own more than 17 percent of the company. Together, those three have more of the stock than Musk does. Their stakes are worth well over $100 billion of a $700 billion company. They invest the money of retirees and pensioners and who knows who else. All of those people are pumping Tesla’s stock, a few dollars at a time. Even so, Tesla’s stock is bleeding out this year, as Musk gets negative attention for his practically limitless reign over much of the federal government. The S&P 500 has lost 12 percent on the year, but Tesla has lost a much grislier 40 percent. People are fleeing Tesla’s stock at rates that far exceed other stocks or the index funds that track that whole kit and caboodle. The effort to rein in Musk by crushing Tesla’s stock is now a major cultural movement. Its tactics are demonstrations at Tesla showrooms, flyers on windshields, posts on social media, and, for a tiny minority, property damage. The movement hasn’t yet arrived at what could be one of its most effective tools. Probably, this is because “the movement” is not a coordinated front between run-of-the-mill Musk opponents and financial professionals who would like to make some money off them while also maybe fighting Musk for sincere reasons. But eventually, it will get there. The biggest unturned stone in the battle against Musk is the one around exchange-traded funds—baskets of stocks that you buy in a package, with the price updating all day unlike mutual funds, which for now give Tesla’s stock a useful insurance policy. JPMorgan counts about 3,500 ETFs listed in the United States, holding more than $9 trillion in assets as of last October. There are only 4,300 publicly traded American companies, and that number has fallen hard since the mid-1990s as companies have gotten bought up, failed, or gone private. Just domestically, before accounting for thousands of non-U.S. ETFs, we are verging on becoming a country that has more ETFs offering various baskets of stocks than we have actual stocks. There are ETFs for pretty much any concept a financial professional could dream up and sell to investors. The biggest ones track the whole stock market or the S&P 500 and have roughly half a trillion dollars in assets under management each. The market then gets much more targeted. There are countless industry ETFs, tracking health care companies or industrials or consumer staples or semiconductor or electric vehicle companies, or whatever else. Eventually it gets downright bespoke. You want the whole S&P 500 except for the “Magnificent 7” companies that account for about a third of the S&P 500’s value? A fund for that launched last year. Lately it’s losing much less than the broad market, in substantial part because Tesla is one of the seven companies it doesn’t buy. The ETF market can also be mean, picking on specific people. One ETF just shorts stocks that famous investor Cathie Wood likes. For a few glorious moments, there was an “Inverse Jim Cramer” fund, long may it live. The idea seems so obvious that it’s head-scratching nobody with a big platform has so much as called for it yet: One of the best ways to sting Tesla’s stock, and Musk by extension, would be to create broad index funds that exclude Tesla and thus don’t put their investors’ money into the stock. Ideally, all Americans who have the good fortune to have extra money or a retirement fund match should be encouraged to put away what they can, and specifically to put it in broad market index funds. Those funds are a crucial source of demand for Tesla’s stock, though. If you’d like to put your money to work for your future but think Musk is a threat to your country’s future, you might be taking some contradictory steps all the time. What is to be done about this conflict? The most aggressive option for Tesla Takedown proponents would be to mount a campaign demanding that the Vanguards and BlackRocks of the world remove Tesla from their major index funds. That would be a bad and doomed option. The companies would not do it, nor should they, because they are offering index funds that track the stock market, and Tesla is one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Also, in less noble reasoning, these enormous asset managers are not going to pick an overt fight with Musk and by extension the entire Republican Party. (They are already on the back foot over “woke” investing, and this would get that party going again.) There is another option, though: Find a financial firm that wants to make tons of money by selling an investment product to millions of furious liberals while charging a reasonable fee, and demand that Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission stop them. It would not be hard, or counter to the rules that typically govern the ETF market, for an enterprising issuer to launch a fund that includes the whole stock market except Tesla. There’s already the one that excludes seven mega-companies including Tesla. It’s not clear that there would be any legal problem with launching an explicitly anti-Tesla ETF and marketing it as such. But perhaps you, a financial professional attuned to risk, want to be safe. You could launch the Properly Valued Companies ETF, which does not buy the stock of car companies that have regularly traded at a price of more than 200 times their earnings per share. Who knows how many companies that would cover? Perhaps you could launch the Focused Bosses Fund (ticker: $FBF), which buys the whole S&P 500 except for companies whose CEOs also run other multibillion-dollar companies and hold government posts. Who could blame you for catering to investors who want disciplined management? The ETF market will find a way to develop pretty much any product that people want to buy, even if that product is financially dubious. This one would not be financially dubious, and if marketed well, I suspect many, many people would want to buy it. If an ETF issuer gets more than $50 million into its fund, and quite possibly less than that, it should be making money by charging a fee of much less than 1 percent per year on its invested dollars. There are more than 50 million American dollars out there that are poised to find their way into a non-Tesla, broad-market ETF. It would take some time for an offering like this to affect Tesla’s share price to an extent we would notice. But stocks go up when people (or index funds) buy them, and they go down when people sell them. Offering a break in the link between investing in the whole stock market and boosting Tesla’s share price would have the latter effect. It’s also the sort of thing that you could imagine Musk spinning out over, causing him to go on late-night X tirades about. He seems like a pretty distractible fellow. Some of the second-order problems with this approach are clear. The clearest is that in the current version of the U.S. government, one that finds fresh ways all the time to enrich Musk, the SEC might never approve a fund that positioned itself so overtly against the world’s richest person. That’s no reason not to make the government say no, though. The opportunity is there for Musk’s opponents, the sort of people who don’t already own Tesla stock or cars, to vote with their portfolios. The chance is also there for an investment business to profit, even cynically, from that desire. Isn’t this just a matter of time? Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: Four Value Stock Picks From Two Top Managers For Q2 2025

ByJacob Wolinsky ByJacob Wolinsky, Contributor. NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 16: A sign hangs on the BlackRock offices on January 16, 2014 in New York ... More City. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Value stocks bounced in the second half of last year, and several experts are saying the day of value is returning. However, BlackRock is warning that investors might be underweight value stocks at a time when the markets could start shifting. Additionally, history has shown that savvy stock picking is a better way to gain access to value stocks rather than by tracking one of the value indexes. Here are four value stock picks from two leading managers as the second quarter goes into full swing. In a recent interview, Judson Traphagen of Plough Penny Partners chose Lesaka Technologies (NASDAQ:LSAK) and Veon (NASDAQ:VEON), which are trading at around $4.50 and $45 a share, respectively. Meanwhile, Alyx Wood of Kernow Asset Management selected Card Factory (LON:CARD) and Kistos (LON:KIST), which are trading at around GBX90 and GBX129 a share. Plough Penny Partners is a long-biased, fundamental growth fund that prefers to target holding periods of between three to five years. The fund typically holds a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 20 long positions with a handful of opportunistic shorts. Plough Penny specifically targets high-growth technology companies, investing globally in fintech, software and internet companies. Kernow Asset Management uses a long-short equity strategy in search of contrarian alpha from U.K. equities. The firm pairs fundamental analysis with catalyst-driven mean reversion investments. Kernow seeks market inefficiencies and tries to determine how they work and how valuation gaps might be closed. Traphagen describes Lesaka as an under-the-radar small-cap fintech company undergoing secular growth and in the early stages of a multi-year trajectory. The company’s business is largely in southern Africa. Comparing Lesaka to StoneCo and Nubank in Latin America, Traphagen believes it’s perhaps the best way for U.S. investors to target Africa’s largely untapped growth market for fintech. In the same way Square serves U.S. customers, Lesaka provides digital financial solutions to consumers and merchants in southern Africa. Traphagen was initially drawn to Lesaka Technologies because he’s always seeking companies with great management, rapid revenue growth, and expanding margins that are operating in massive total addressable markets. He also seeks companies with solid unit economics and that have “barely penetrated their target markets.” “We have made money in emerging markets fintech stocks like Nubank and StoneCo in Latin America and had read that Africa was the next big market in fintech, so we looked for a stock to benefit from that trend,” Traphagen explained. “LSAK is that stock.” In the short term, he believes Lesaka Technologies is worth $7.50 a share, but he suspects it might end up being a multi-bagger in the long term. Veon is a telecommunications company that operates in frontier markets, providing traditional telco services and newer digital products and services. In recent years, it has sped up its digital products and services and now generates a sizable share of its revenues from digital products and services. Like with Lesaka, Traphagen believes the opportunity in Veon exists because it’s still largely unknown to U.S. investors, operating in markets that are essentially alien to U.S. investors, although it trades on the Nasdaq. Traphagen was initially attracted to Veon because of its valuation, but then he discovered its “compelling” total addressable market and opportunity for digital products in an area where competition by U.S. technology companies is lacking. He also was attracted to Veon because the company is ambitiously de-levering, selling off non-core assets and repurchasing shares. Card Factory is a top greeting card retailer in the U.K. that also sells gifts, party supplies and related products. The company was founded based on the opportunity to sell greeting cards at much lower price points than competitors via a vertically integrated business model that includes manufacturing cards in-house. Interestingly, Wood was initially drawn to Card Factory as a potential short position during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the company had high debt and was facing the possibility of bankruptcy. However, after Wood ran the fundamentals and conducted the people and strategy work, he found the company to be of higher quality than he had expected. “This made it a long idea as soon as they started growing profits and the debt was cleared by cashflow,” Wood explained. “The business is trading at a distressed price. This is at odds to the great balance sheet, and profits are set to double. It’s a hidden quality growth stock. So we did more work and linked our trade journey to the partnerships, which are free growth centers.” Management expects to double their profits over the next three years, although Wood said the market is skeptical because of the seemingly untested partnerships and international expansion. However, he added that they’re “comfortable with being paid to take the risk for free.” Those partnerships are basically new places where Card Factory’s cards are being sold on stands within stores rather than just on the High Street. Kistos is an independent, integrated energy company that has both upstream and midstream operations that span international markets. Wood was initially drawn to the stock by the 350% gap with their valuation in the Kernow Valuation Framework, which begins with valuing companies using their proprietary fundamental bottom-up process. He feels Kistos has a clear edge over other oil and gas companies because it extracts value from overlooked assets “more efficiently than almost anyone else.” Wood estimates the company’s intrinsic value at £350 million, although its market cap is only a mere £100 million currently. He said the company’s production is set to almost double this year to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the market is ignoring this potential. According to BlackRock, growth stocks accounted for 37% of the S&P 500 as of the end of November, versus the historical average of 24%. This was due to the heavy favoritism assigned to growth stocks in the first half of 2024 as investors widely preferred mega-cap technology stocks. However, that high concentration could unintentionally leave many investor portfolios coming up short in the diversification department, meaning a greater chance of missing out on the upside from rallies in value stocks like the one that started in July 2024. Thus, investors might want to take a closer look at their portfolios to see where they stand in the value-versus-growth.

Title: Americans Believe Russian Disinformation ‘To Alarming Degree’

ByEmma Woollacott ByEmma Woollacott, Senior Contributor. View of The national flag of the Russian Federation with view of St Basil's Cathedral at sunny day ... More in Moscow, Russia A third of Americans have fallen for Russian disinformation — and for other false online claims. An online survey carried out between February and March this year by leading market research and analytics organization YouGov, commissioned by data analysis and news rating firm NewsGuard, presented a nationally representative sample of 1,000 respondents with 10 false claims that have spread widely online. These included three that originated from or were mainly spread by Russian media outlets. Respondents were asked to mark each claim—all of which have been authoritatively and widely debunked—with a response of “True,” “False,” or “Not Sure.” And, the researchers found, Americans are falling for Kremlin disinformation to an alarming degree, along with other false claims relating to health and medicine, elections and international conflicts. Indeed, of the 10 false presented, 78% of respondents believed at least one, and fewer than 1 in 100 managed to correctly identify all 10 claims as false. A quarter believed, for example, that up to half the U.S. aid money given to Ukraine was stolen by Ukrainian officials for personal use. More than half incorrectly thought that Ukraine sold Hamas weapons that had been donated by the U.S. Meanwhile, fewer than half of respondents correctly identified as false the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed between 7.3 and 15 million people worldwide, while 1 in 5 said they believed the claim to be true. These claims were made on the basis of numbers described as arbitrary by experts, and not based on any research. "The false narrative is based on an inaccurate analysis of deaths reported after Covid vaccination to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a U.S. government database that collects unverified reports of adverse reports following vaccination," said NewsGuard. "The analysis was conducted by Edward Dowd, a former portfolio manager for investment management company BlackRock, who has no medical background and has previously made false claims about Covid-19 vaccines." Gullibility appears to cut across party lines, with respondents identifying as Democrats just as likely as Republicans to believe at least one of the 10 false claims. Republicans were, though, more likely to believe Russian disinformation claims than their Democratic counterparts, with 57.6% falling for at least one Russian disinformation claim, compared with just 17.9% of Democrats and 29.5% of people who didn't identify with one particular party. Russia is spending significant amounts on promulgating misinformation in the U.S. Last year, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two people for funneling nearly $10 million through a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish misinformation about Ukraine. And around the same time, the Justice Department seized 32 internet domains that the Russian government and Russian government-sponsored actors had been using to try and influence the 2024 elections. "An internal planning document created by the Kremlin states that a goal of the campaign is to secure Russia’s preferred outcome in the election," said then–attorney general Merrick Garland. "The sites we are seizing were filled with Russian government propaganda that had been created by the Kremlin to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies and interests, and influence voters in the United States and other countries," Garland added. All in all, said NewsGuard, Russian disinformation efforts targeting Americans continue to accelerate, and they’ve become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. "In the ongoing battle between fiction and reality, fiction—much of it created by Russia’s robust disinformation machine—appears to be winning," it warned.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/22/2025 5:07:58 AM PDT by ChicagoConservative27 Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) claimed Thursday on CNN’s “The Source” that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was the wrong person for his position. Kaine said, “This is a sad but very predictable situation. I think those of us on the Armed Services Committee who looked at Pete Hegseth’s material and it was voluminous before his hearing and the vote on his confirmation. Two things were plain when he was in the uniform of the United States, he served admirably, but in his leadership positions in many organizations, since his uniform service, he’s demonstrated appalling lack of judgment, both professionally and personally. And that’s why many of us, including Republicans, voted against him to be secretary of defense. And what’s happened in the last few weeks about these two Signalgate atrocities just shows the lack of judgment and that he is the wrong person to be our secretary of defense.” (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

Title: The Hidden Costs Of Unsustainable Project Practices

ByJoel Carboni ByJoel Carboni, Forbes Councils Member. Joel Carboni, President of GPM is a pioneer in advancing sustainable practices for organizations in both projects and operations. For years, businesses have viewed sustainability as a box to check—a marketing play, a feel-good initiative or something to address once all the “real” work is done. But companies that see sustainability as an added cost are missing the bigger picture. The true cost of unsustainable project management isn’t always obvious—it’s lurking in project delays, bloated budgets, supply chain disruptions, regulatory penalties and reputational damage. At its core, project management is about delivering value efficiently. And when sustainability is left out of the equation, projects can become more expensive, riskier and—quite frankly—less competitive. Here’s how the hidden costs of unsustainable project management can add up: Let’s talk numbers. Every project has a budget, but unsustainable projects often cost more than anyone initially realizes. Poor planning can lead to wasted materials, rework and inefficiencies that blow timelines and drain capital. Consider the construction industry. A developer may opt for cheaper, non-sustainable materials to cut upfront costs. But those materials often degrade faster, require costly maintenance and drive up long-term operating expenses. Suddenly, that “cost-effective” choice turns into a budget nightmare. It’s the same story in IT, infrastructure and manufacturing—any sector where short-term thinking leads to long-term waste. Take the global timber shortage in 2021. Companies that failed to anticipate rising material costs and over-relied on non-renewable sources saw their manufacturing expenses skyrocket. Meanwhile, competitors with sustainable sourcing strategies were able to adapt without breaking stride. And then there’s Carillion, the U.K. construction giant that collapsed in 2018. A major factor? A reckless approach to project management—unsustainable contracts, poor risk assessment and wasteful spending that ultimately led to bankruptcy and government intervention. The potential cost of ignoring sustainability: Budget overruns, excessive waste and a never-ending cycle of rework and maintenance costs. Regulations around sustainability aren’t getting looser—they’re getting stricter. Governments worldwide are cracking down on emissions, waste management, labor practices and corporate ESG disclosures. And when businesses don’t take sustainability seriously, they don’t just risk a slap on the wrist—they could face fines, lawsuits and potential shutdowns. Take Volkswagen’s diesel scandal. The automaker rigged emissions tests to make its vehicles appear more eco-friendly. The result? Over $30 billion in fines, lawsuits and vehicle buybacks. Or look at Boeing’s 737 MAX disaster. At its root, it was a failure in ethical project management. Cutting corners on safety led to two fatal crashes, a worldwide grounding of aircraft and billions in fines and lost revenue. Businesses that ignore sustainability aren’t just rolling the dice with their reputation—they’re gambling with their financial future. And in today’s regulatory climate, that’s a bet no one should be taking. The potential cost of non-compliance: Regulatory fines, lawsuits and business disruptions that eat into the bottom line. Reputation isn’t just about good PR—it’s about trust. And in a world where consumers and investors are paying attention, companies that fake sustainability get exposed fast. Fast fashion brands, such as H&M, have been called out for greenwashing, making big sustainability claims with little action to back them up. The backlash isn’t just social media noise—it hits revenue hard. Today’s consumers have options, and they’re choosing brands that actually walk the talk. Investors are doing the same, directing capital away from companies with weak ESG commitments. Even BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has made it clear: "We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients." The potential cost of a bad reputation: Loss of consumer trust, declining stock value and long-term brand damage. The next generation of workers aren't just looking for a paycheck. They want purpose. And if companies don’t offer it, they’ll go somewhere that does. A 2024 Deloitte study found that a company’s sustainability efforts influences employees' career-related decisions. And if leadership doesn’t take sustainability seriously? Employees are walking. Google saw this firsthand in 2019 when thousands of employees staged a walkout in protest of the company’s deals with fossil fuel firms. The message was clear: Sustainability isn’t just about corporate responsibility—it’s an employee demand, too. The potential cost of ignoring talent: Higher turnover, recruitment struggles and a disengaged workforce. Companies that fail to prioritize sustainability in their supply chain set themselves up for failure. Just look at the 2021 global semiconductor shortage—a crisis that crippled industries from automotive to consumer tech. Companies that didn’t diversify their suppliers or invest in sustainable sourcing strategies were left scrambling. And climate-related disruptions? They’re only getting worse. According to the World Economic Forum, droughts, floods and wildfires are impacting everything from food production to raw material sourcing. Businesses that ignore these risks face increased costs and supply chain bottlenecks. The potential cost of a weak supply chain: Delays, rising costs and loss of market competitiveness. In closing, sustainability shouldn't be viewed as a cost, but rather as a competitive advantage. Companies that embed sustainability into their project management practices aren’t just doing the right thing—they’re setting themselves up for long-term profitability, risk resilience and competitive differentiation. In a rapidly evolving market, sustainability isn’t just about compliance or reputation—it’s about staying ahead of industry shifts and future-proofing operations against emerging challenges. Sustainability can reduce financial waste, lower legal risks, strengthen brand reputation, attract top talent and fortify supply chains against disruption. It creates operational efficiencies, drives innovation and enhances customer loyalty in ways that short-term cost-cutting never will.

Title: EV battery maker Northvolt failed after blowing through $15 billion. This US rival thinks it won't suffer the same fate.

Time Published: 2025-04-22T09:00:02Z

When Northvolt went bankrupt, it sent shockwaves through the cleantech industry. Backed by big names such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, the Swedish startup had set out to revolutionize electric vehicle battery production — not just recycling them but also making new ones. Redwood Materials, a US rival run by Tesla's cofounder JB Straubel, is trying to tackle the same problem without succumbing to overambition. To do that, it focuses on upstream materials, maintains strategic partnerships, and avoids direct competition with customers. Northvolt's vision was as audacious as it was complex. With $15 billion in funding, the company planned to handle everything in-house: sourcing raw materials, recycling batteries into black mass (a powder rich in nickel, lithium, cobalt, and manganese), refining that material via hydrometallurgy, and then producing battery cells at a massive scale. With that scope came massive risk. Building and scaling cell manufacturing — especially outside Asia — is notoriously difficult. Northvolt struggled to ramp up operations at its Arctic Circle facility and increasingly relied on Chinese equipment, which slowed production and created bottlenecks. Costs ballooned, debts mounted, and the company ultimately couldn't keep up. "Northvolt went a little too fast," an investor who has backed startups in this industry said. "They tried to commercialize before perfecting the process at scale." This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters. Northvolt did not respond to a request for comment. Redwood Materials, by contrast, focuses on what it sees as the most valuable — and underinvested — piece of the EV battery supply chain: cathode active materials. CAMs account for roughly 60% of a battery's value and 15% of an electric vehicle's cost, Redwood says. There's no large-scale CAM production in North America, and that's the gap Redwood wants to fill. "We're not making battery cells. That's never been part of the plan," Cal Lankton, Redwood's chief commercial officer, said. "We don't want to compete with our customers." Instead, Redwood recycles EV battery production scrap and old batteries into usable metals and refines them into CAMs, which it sells to cell manufacturers such as Panasonic and Toyota. This strategy keeps the company neutral, while generating revenue from multiple points in the supply chain. "As JB would say, we can be Switzerland," Lankton told me when I met him recently at Redwood's campus in Nevada's high desert. Unlike Northvolt, which produced its own batteries and used its recycled material internally, Redwood aims to sell its refined materials to a wide variety of customers, reducing dependency on any one player and avoiding direct competition with partners that make batteries. "What Northvolt set out to build is incredibly impressive — the scope, the aspiration of what they tried to do," Lankton said. "I don't want to come across at all as denigrating what happened." But he said that by trying to make batteries itself, Northvolt added extra layers of risk, complexity, and expense. "You're competing with your customers. So you would only produce CAM for your own consumption, which was Northvolt's plan, right?" Lankton added. "So if any piece in there falls apart, the whole thing breaks." Redwood has also been more measured in its scaling. While Northvolt attempted to go from lab to commercial production in one giant leap, Redwood moves step-by-step — refining materials, building CAM capacity, and taking on new challenges only when it's ready. For example, Lankton said that while Redwood initially intended to hold onto intermediate recycled materials until its CAM operations ramped up, the company made a tactical pivot: Sell the intermediate products now, generate revenue, and prove its capabilities. "A dollar today for a company in our position is much more valuable than a dollar to use in the future," Lankton said. "Let's convert that inventory into cash. Let's demonstrate our capability to our investors, to our customers, to the market." Redwood also used to make copper foil, a main ingredient in batteries. When Chinese companies began churning this out in massive quantities, prices plummeted, so Redwood halted that part of its business. "We're not dogmatic," Lankton said. "We're not going to take a business plan and just do it until we think it works and run ourselves into the ground." Northvolt's bankruptcy isn't just a cautionary tale — it's a live case study. The company's downfall underscores the perils of overintegration, overreach, and underestimating the difficulty of battery cell manufacturing. Redwood Materials is learning and taking a different tack by positioning itself not as a battery maker but as an enabler of the EV battery supply chain. "I think that's one of the strengths of Redwood, and I — again, not to put too fine a point on it, something that Northvolt kind of struggled with, which is finding those pivot points when the original plan perhaps is getting more expensive or further out in the future," Lankton said.

Title: Crypto Firms Circle And BitGo Set To Pursue US Bank Licenses, WSJ

Crypto is reportedly becoming more integrated into the conventional banking system, according to the Wall Street Journal. This shift occurs after the regulatory crackdown that followed the failure of crypto exchange FTX and its aftermath for many crypto-friendly institutions caused many in the conventional financial sector to withdraw their support from the digital asset market. But now, with Trump’s recent vow to make America a “Bitcoin superpower,” things might be starting to change, the report alleges, and more integration between crypto and conventional banking could be on the horizon. Several crypto firms, including Circle and BitGo, are reportedly planning to apply for banking charters or licenses. Notably, Coinbase Global and the stablecoin company Paxos are also considering similar steps. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Trump administration aims to mainstream crypto finances, as such, Congress is advancing legislation that would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. These proposed regulations would require stablecoin issuers to obtain charters or licenses from regulators, a move that could fundamentally change the operational dynamics of the digital asset market. Many firms are exploring options for national trust or industrial bank charters, which would allow them to function similarly to conventional banks by accepting deposits and making loans. Others are reportedly pursuing more specialized licenses that would enable them to issue stablecoins. Any firm that secures a banking charter will face stricter oversight, a reality that has been vividly illustrated by Anchorage Digital, the only digital asset firm in the US to hold a federal bank charter. CEO Nathan McCauley told the Wall Street Journal that the company has invested tens of millions of dollars to meet regulatory obligations, which include stringent anti-money-laundering measures. Anchorage’s recent partnership with major financial players, including BlackRock and Cantor Fitzgerald, underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. Just a few years ago, major banks severed ties with crypto firms amid a wave of regulatory scrutiny following the FTX incident. The fallout from the collapse of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank left many crypto entrepreneurs struggling to find banking partners willing to accept their deposits or provide loans. However, the political climate is shifting, and under Trump’s administration, regulators have begun to relax restrictions that previously required banks to obtain approval for crypto-related activities. New guidance on how banks can engage with crypto is anticipated later this year. Some banks are eager to catch up and establish partnerships within the crypto space. For instance, Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan expressed interest in issuing a stablecoin, contingent upon a solid legal framework. Similarly, US Bancorp recently announced plans to relaunch its digital asset custody service in collaboration with NYDIG, a Bitcoin trading and banking firm. Conversely, some banks remain cautious. KeyCorp’s CEO Chris Gorman acknowledged the potential risks posed by digital assets, viewing them as both an opportunity and a competitive threat. Gorman emphasized the importance of understanding the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning anti-money-laundering safeguards.

Title: Gerry Thornley: Leinster’s success masking alarming fault lines which have emerged in Irish rugby
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/22/gerry-thornley-leinsters-success-masking-alarming-fault-lines-which-have-emerged-in-irish-rugby/
Time Published: 2025-04-22T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
On the surface, all seems hunky dory. The Ireland men’s team are ranked third in the world, the ever-improving women’s side are ranked fifth and Leinster are one more home semi-final win away from becoming the first side ever to reach four successive Champions Cup finals. Scratch underneath, though, and the gap between Leinster and the other three provinces has never been bigger, nor more alarming. For sure, there is nothing particularly new in Leinster being the last Irish team standing in Europe. They have been the only Irish team in the semi-final stages of the Champions Cup for six seasons in a row now, while Ulster haven’t been in a final for 13 years and Munster for 17 seasons. However, it’s not just that the other three provinces are so far away from dining at European rugby’s top table, it’s that there is no sign of this changing any time soon. Furthermore, take the URC, a competition which the Irish teams used to routinely dominate. Two seasons ago, Leinster, Ulster, Munster and Connacht all reached the playoffs. The latter three, on average, had a 61 per cent winning ratio that season. This season, as things stand, Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all lost more matches than they have won. Between them, the trio’s winning ratio has dropped to 42 per cent. Munster sit seventh, Ulster 10th and Connacht 12th, and there is a real possibility that Leinster might be the only Irish team in the playoffs and hence the only Irish team in next season’s Champions Cup, with the other three consigned to the Challenge Cup. It shouldn’t come to that. The others are still in the mix, but then again it might come to that. This cannot be solely attributable to the arrival of the South African teams. After all, they were there two seasons ago. Throw in the provinces’ respective Champions Cup and Challenge Cup games this season and whereas Leinster’s winning ratio is 95 per cent, for the three others combined this figure is 45 per cent. This is truly alarming. But then again this is the inevitable byproduct of the increasing centralisation of the Irish system and its focus on international teams, be they 15s or Sevens, during the tenure of David Nucifora as the IRFU performance director. And it could take many years to rectify the problem. The IRFU invest equally in the pathways of all four provinces but they are not receiving much in return from Munster, Ulster and Connacht, although the Union’s focus on Provincial Talent Squads and National Talent Squads seems only to have shrunk the base designed to develop international quality players. Next season there will be 14 centrally contracted players, of whom four came from the pathways in New Zealand (Bundee Aki, James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park) and Australia (Mack Hansen). Connacht can rightly lay claim to Robbie Henshaw, but the other nine, including Munster’s only centrally contracted player, Tadhg Beirne, came through the Leinster pathway. Not one player came through Munster or Ulster, and the latter do not have one centrally contracted player next season. Last week’s announcement by the IRFU that the provinces are to be responsible for 40 per cent of national player contracts where previously the figure had been set at 30 per cent is a step in the right direction. It is estimated that this will free up around €500-€600,000 for the IRFU to redistribute toward improving the pathways in Connacht, Munster and Ulster. One sincerely hopes that these monies are used to upgrade the yawning gulf in facilities and coaching which exists between the elite rugby-playing schools in Leinster compared to the other three provinces. As well as having this and other socio-economic advantages, true to type Leinster were also quicker out of the blocks in breaking into their own schools. As with the other provinces, schools rugby had been something of an impenetrable sacred cow, but teachers – under heightened pressure academically – don’t have the time for coaching which they once had. So, maybe the other three provinces should stop trying to emulate the Leinster system and focus their energies and player development on their clubs. For it’s hard to see how the Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast schools will ever match the facilities and coaching budgets of St Michael’s, Blackrock et al. The IRFU have done many things right, eventually, in the professional era but in investing more heavily on Ireland international teams they have taken their eye off the provinces. And although Team Ireland should be strong for another few years yet, the chickens are already coming home to roost. Remember the 90s? Team Ireland could hardly buy a win. That was partly because the same was true of all four provinces in the early days of professionalism and the European Cup. Then came Ulster’s 1999 European Cup triumph and, in particular, Munster’s emergence in the noughties to reach four finals, winning two of them in 2006 and 2008. This was followed by Leinster’s arrival among European rugby’s true elite, which provided the players with the confidence to establish Ireland as one of the best sides in the world. Viewed in that light, Leinster’s excellence should be celebrated. Where Irish rugby would be without them really doesn’t bear thinking about. That’s why the stellar signings of the last 12 months, and the IRFU sanctioning the arrival of Rieko Ioane, are positives. Leinster winning the Champions Cup would be brilliant for Irish rugby. Rather than close the gap by diluting Leinster in any way, the Union need to strengthen the other three. The restructuring of the Union’s funding model last week is presumably with this ideal in mind and followed ‘a planned review of its funding model’. Hence it had been in the pipeline for a year or so, and it will take many years for it to bear fruit. The likelihood is that much of the investment in Under-20s and Sevens programmes will also be redirected towards the other three provinces. But it is already clear that while this is a step in the right direction, it is most likely a drop in the ocean and not nearly enough to address the underlining and alarming fault lines which have emerged in Irish rugby. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street Journal: Trump's Less Border Migration Allows More Airport Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/04/21/wall-street-journal-trumps-less-illegal-migration-allows-more-legalized-migration/
Time Published: 2025-04-22T03:30:36Z

President Donald Trump has successfully stopped the inflow of economic migrants via the southern border, so he should invite more economic migrants via the nation’s airports, says the Wall Street Journal. The political “question is whether Mr. Trump can use the political capital from his border victory to achieve a more lasting immigration success,” the newspaper’s pro-migration editors declared. According to WSJ-owner Rupert Murdoch’s editors, Trump’s “opportunity” for “immigration success” should: include more pathways for legal immigration to address the labor needs of a growing economy. Half of small businesses say one of their largest problems is finding workers. If Mr. Trump wants more fruits and vegetables grown at home, who’s going to pick them? … If Mr. Trump wants Silicon Valley to win the AI race, why are H-1B skilled visas capped at a low number and handed out by lottery? The newspaper’s illegal=bad/legal=good message comes as Trump’s deputies are charting a course back to a lower-migration, high-productivity United States, away from the post-1990 cheap-labor economy that transfers ordinary Americans’ wages into profits for quarterly CEOs and Wall Street investors. The promise of cheap labor is “a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told his audience of investors in March: Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor. Breitbart News has posted many articles about migration’s harmful impact on productivity and innovation — and also how tight labor markets help pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity. In the white-collar sector, Breitbart News has shown how visa programs created by Congress and executives — such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs — have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing. The damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers. The economic damage of migration has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said.

Title: Wall Street and the dollar tumble as investors retreat further from the United States

Elaine Kurtenbach Associated Press Published: April 20, 2025 at 9:56 PM Updated: April 21, 2025 at 4:16 PM Elaine Kurtenbach Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Trader Sal Suarino works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Wall Street weakened Monday as investors worldwide get more skeptical about U.S. investments because of President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order. The S&P 500 sank 2.4% in another wipeout. That yanked the index that’s at the center of many 401(k) accounts 16% below its record set two months ago. Recommended Videos The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5%, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds and the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world’s safest investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say they’re having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. “We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. “The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.” That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin. On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle maker’s stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that the stock price had gone too high and that CEO Elon Musk’s role in leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending is damaging the brand. Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell. Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90. Gold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States’ standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market.

Key Points Direct Answer What Tether DoesTether is the company behind USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning each USDT is supposed to be backed by an equivalent amount in reserves like cash or assets. How Tether Makes MoneyTether likely makes money in a few main ways, though the exact details can be complex: Controversy and UncertaintyThere’s debate about how transparent Tether is with its reserves, with past issues like fines for not maintaining full reserves, which might affect trust in its reported profits. For 2024, it reported $5.2 billion in profit for the first half, but exact figures can vary (Wikipedia – Tether). What is Omni and What Are Some Interesting Use Cases of It: A Comprehensive Analysis This note provides a detailed examination of how Tether makes money, exploring its business model, revenue streams, and the controversies surrounding its operations. It builds on the initial overview, offering a thorough analysis for readers seeking a deeper understanding, current as of 7:12 PM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025. Introduction to Tether and Its Business Model Tether is the company behind USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each USDT in circulation is theoretically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars or other assets held in reserves. Launched in 2014, Tether has become one of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, with a reported value of nearly $99 billion as of March 2024 (Investopedia – Tether (USDT)). Its primary function is to provide stability to crypto traders and investors by offering a digital asset that mirrors the value of fiat currency, facilitating transfers between cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial systems. The question of how Tether makes money is nuanced, as it operates in a controversial space with regulatory scrutiny and transparency issues. This note explores its revenue generation mechanisms, drawing on recent research and examples from 2024 and early 2025. Tether’s Revenue Streams Tether generates revenue through several key mechanisms, leveraging its role as a stablecoin issuer and its management of reserves. Below are the primary ways Tether makes money, supported by recent data and examples: Controversies and Transparency Issues Tether’s revenue generation has been controversial, particularly around the transparency and management of its reserves. Research suggests several issues that impact trust in its profitability claims: These controversies suggest that while Tether reports significant profits, the exact mechanisms and transparency of its revenue generation remain debated, affecting trust among investors and regulators. Comparative Analysis with Other Stablecoins Research, such as Forbes Advisor – What Is Tether?, indicates that other stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI) also generate revenue through interest on reserves, but Tether’s scale and strategic investments set it apart. Its ability to hold over $97.6 billion in Treasuries and report $5.2 billion in profit for H1 2024 highlights its dominant position, though regulatory scrutiny remains higher due to past issues. Practical Examples and Adoption Despite controversies, Tether’s revenue model has driven significant adoption: Risks and Challenges Tether’s revenue generation faces challenges: Conclusion Research suggests Tether makes money primarily through interest on its reserves, especially U.S. Treasury securities, investment profits from assets like gold and bitcoin, and strategic investments in companies like Blackrock Neutro and Rumble. It may also earn from transaction and issuance fees, though this is likely smaller. However, controversies around reserve transparency, like past CFTC fines and debates over profit reporting, highlight the complexity and debate surrounding its revenue model. This analysis, current as of April 21, 2025, underscores Tether’s significant profitability, balancing its role as a stablecoin with regulatory and trust challenges.

Title: Report: New Valuation Push for Elon Musk’s xAI

After spending much of his time and energy this year as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), could Elon Musk be pivoting to refocus on his businesses? Sources familiar with an xAI investor call last week told CNBC Monday (April 21) that Musk was on the call and is seeking to establish a “proper valuation” for his artificial intelligence (AI) startup. Although Musk, who was a co-founder of AI pioneer OpenAI, did not formally announce a capital funding round for xAI, the sources for the CNBC report think that is coming soon. The sources also said a $1 billion potential run rate figure was mentioned on the call. CNBC said the investor call took place just months after reports that xAI was seeking to secure up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, with the funding reportedly coming from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and backing from global investors. That capital was earmarked for acquiring 100,000 Nvidia chips, CNBC said, a key component in the company’s AI infrastructure. xAI recently merged with the Musk-owned social media platform X in an all-stock deal. PYMNTS reported that he valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Founded in July 2023, xAI launched the chatbot Grok last year to compete with other leading AI chatbots, including Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The CNBC report said that at the time, xAI touted that Grok’s real-time internet knowledge enabled it to launch with just two months of training. PYMNTS reported in March that xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI Infrastructure Partnership backed by BlackRock, Microsoft, and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, with the ultimate goal to raise up to $100 billion for AI development. The partnership aims to build the next generation of AI-ready data centers and support the escalating demands of generative AI models. The CNBC report also noted that Tesla, where Musk is CEO, experienced a 40% decline in shares this year and could raise questions about his management bandwidth.

Title: First XV rugby: Tauranga’s storming preseason; St Kentigern win another Quadrangular, 2024 global school rankings, Hamilton’s Sanix Tournament opponents

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Tauranga Boys’ College have hit the ground running in 2025, despite having a relatively new First XV rugby team with only seven returnees from last season. The defending Super 8 champions have amassed 169 points in four consecutive pre-season victories and there was more than a hint of excitement about some of their players when, in a rare visit to the capital on Saturday, Tauranga topped Wellington College 45-31. And that was without co-captains Jay McQuoid and Ethan McManemin, who were sidelined with concussion stand-downs. It’s been a tough 2025 rebuild for Tauranga coach Aidan Kuka. In 2024, he could call upon the New Zealand Secondary Schools starting halfback-first five combination of Charlie Sinton and Mason Verster, who have now left. But he’s hoping lessons from their time remain, particularly for new first five-eighths Ivan Ward. “Charlie and Mason worked really hard to promote themselves and create a competitive environment for the team last year,” Kuka said. “The challenge for this year’s group is to build that again. “I don’t think I can replicate talented players as coach – individuals have to understand who they are as a player. “But Ivan had a front-row seat last year to what a good 9 or 10 should look like – how they pushed each other, how they prepared and recovered, how they guided the team, and has learned off them.” In pleasantly autumnal conditions, the Wellington-Tauranga match was a vibrant spectacle between two sides expected to be leading contenders in their respective competitions. Wellington gained a brief ascendancy before the interval. Tauranga lock Blake Vrieze was sin-binned and the hosts flipped a 19-12 deficit into a 24-19 advantage with tries to prop Harry Baddington and No 8 Z’Kdeus Schwalger – without his formerly captivating Afro but no less unmistakable with his rigorous athleticism. But the biggest drawcard was Tommy McQuoid. The Tauranga fullback bagged four tries, a feat almost unheard of by visitors to the forebodingly nicknamed “Graveyard”. (It’s likely Hurricanes winger Kini Naholo holds the record for most tries in any game against Wellington College. In 2017, he scored five tries in a 78-0 win for the eventual National Top Four champions, Hastings Boys’ High.) McQuoid was rugby ethereal, moving so light and rapidly on his feet it seemed he could reject the BOP Steamers Academy for K-pop. Early in the second half, McQuoid latched on to an errant pass and sprinted 80m to complete his hat-trick. Kuka described McQuoid as an exciting prospect promoted from last year’s Tauranga Under-15s. “Opponents underestimate his power,” Kuka said. “He doesn’t look like a strapping athlete, but in contact he has the ability to wriggle out of a tackle. “And he is extremely fast. There is no substitute for speed. He also has a nose for space, an instinct. He is a special player.” A conversion followed from the assured Ward, and the Tauranga Titans didn’t relinquish the lead again. Indeed, Wellington began to implode, conceding a raft of penalties and three successive tries. Hooker Zach Horan, whose dad Sean helps coach Evans Bay-based Marist St Pat’s, rumbled over from a maul. Winger Malachi Emmett regathered a chip-and-chase for a second time, and McQuoid completed his quartet with a 30m surge. Tommy McQuoid’s dad, Grant McQuoid, played 50 games for Bay of Plenty, winning the Ranfurly Shield in 2004 and representing the All Blacks Sevens, while brother Jay is also highly regarded. “Jay’s an abrasive No 7,” Kuka said. “A ‘follow-me’ type of leader who is always full steam ahead.” Except for kickoff receipts (a headache for Tauranga too), there’s a lot to like about Wellington College and they regrouped from 45-24 down to score the last try. “We don’t seem to have a problem in scoring, but I’m more concerned about our defence,” Kuka reflected. Wellington’s mammoth prop, Julius Toimata, had a conspicuous impact. In his third season, first five-eighths Archie Sims offers variety and stability. Centre Narvin Campbell breached the defence more than once. Openside Connor “Notorious” Gregor was all heart. “They were tough,” Kuka said of Wellington. “Some really good players there.” Tauranga now host Auckland Grammar at noon on Saturday. Grammar are reluctant to publicise their First XV rugby these days, but have won all their pre-season matches to date, including a 28-19 away victory over Palmerston North Boys’ High, after leading 17-14 at halftime. Tauranga Boys’ College pre-season: bt Dilworth 36-33, bt Wesley 45-7, bt St John’s (Hamilton) 43-10, bt Wellington College 45-31. In its 2024 Global Top 20 first XV school rankings, the UK-based nextgen.com (Ireland) website selected Tauranga Boys’ College as the third-best behind Paul Roos (South Africa) and Irerland’s Blackrock College. Hamilton Boys’ High were fifth (up from 11th in 2023), Nelson College were 10th (unranked in 2023), St Kentigern were 13th (same as 2023) and Feilding High were a new entrant at 16. But there was no place for Kelston Boys’ High, Blues champions and World Schools Rugby Festival winners (and, incidentally, conquerors of Paul Roos) in Abu Dhabi in December. Nextgen.com 2024 Global rankings: 1.) Paul Roos (South Africa); 2.) Blackrock College (Ireland); 3.) Tauranga Boys’ College (NZ); 4.) Nudgee College (Australia); 5.) Hamilton Boys’ High (NZ); 6.) St Michaels (Ireland); 7.) Paarl Gim (South Africa); 8.) Clifton College (England); 9.) Grey College (South Africa); 10.) Nelson College (NZ); 11.) Millfield (England); 12.) Affies (South Africa); 13.) St Kentigern (NZ); 14.) Sedbergh (England); 15.) Barker College (Australia); 16.) Feilding High (NZ); 17.) Paarl Boys (South Africa); 18.) Shore (Australia); 19.) Cranleigh (England); 20.) Llandovery (Wales). There was little surprise when St Kentigern College defeated St Andrew’s College 39-12 in the final of the Presbyterian Schools Quadrangular Tournament. The Pakūranga powerhouses have won the event on 10 consecutive occasions and 23 times since its inception in 1989. But those who attended the third-place playoff would have been gobsmacked by the outcome of that fixture, as tournament hosts Lindisfarne College embarrassed their longest and fiercest rivals, Scots College, 98-19. Lindisfarne opened in 1953 and have jousted with Scots in various sporting codes since. Since 2014, Scots have won the Wellington Premiership five times and were semifinalists in 2024. Comparatively, Lindisfarne have struggled, making the semifinals of the Central North Island series only twice since 2016. In the unprecedented rout, Lindisfarne scored 14 tries, with Noah Rogers scoring two and kicking nine conversions for an individual haul of 28 points. That beats the 24 points future Rugby World Cup-winning fullback Israel Dagg scored in Lindisfarne’s 24-0 whitewash of Scots in 2005. Te Awarangi Puketapu Pene (3), Fletcher McKay (2) and Charlie East (2) were also multiple try-scorers for Lindisfarne, who have also beaten Super 8 sides Gisborne Boys’ High (27-26) and Palmerston North Boys’ High (34-15) in pre-season. Ironically, Lindisfarne are coached by Andre Bell who guided Scots to the 2023 Wellington Premiership and a 61-26 thumping of Lindisfarne that season. A further dive into the history books reveals Bell attended Lindisfarne. In 1988, he captained a First XV that beat Scots 40-9 and Taradale High School 113-0. In that game, Bell scored 57 points (7 tries, 13 conversions, penalty) in an era when tries were worth only four points. What to make of Scots? Former All Black Dominic Bird is director of rugby with support from Hurricanes Poua head coach Fusi Feaunati. Scots lost by a combined five points to the 2024 finalists, but depth proved to be an issue and remains a challenge with a Second XV that has been in Premier Four. Premier divisions in Wellington typically have 10 teams. Quad Summary: St Kentigern College 43 Lindisfarne College 7. St Andrew’s College 69 Scots College 17. Third playoff: Lindisfarne College 98 Scots College 19. Final: St Kentigern College 39 St Andrew’s College 12. Tournament MVPs: Lindisfarne: Charlie East Scots: Brandon Lo St Andrew’s: Caleb Collins-Polata Saint Kentigern: Siale Pahulu Hamilton Boys High will face three Japanese schools in pool play at the Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, from April 28-May 5: Tokai University Sagami High (Kanagawa), Gose Industrial High School (Nara) and Nagasaki Hokuyodai High School (Nagasaki). Other international entrants in the 24-team tournament are Barker College (Australia), Chien Kuo High (Chinese Taipei), SGS Filton College (England), Ratu Kadavulevu School (Fiji), and Paichai High School (Korea). Meanwhile Howick College are contesting the eight-team girls sevens at the Sanix tournament, facing defending champions Fukuoka Rugby Football Club, Reitaku High School (Chiba, Japan) and Hong Kong China Junior Dragons in pool play. Hamilton Boys’ High School First XV squad for the Sanix tournament: Liam Van Der Heyden, Noah Walker, Dion Fifita, Bailey Dent, Masami Kawai, Ryan Ralph, Caleb Puamau, Hunter Hammond, Corban Dunlop, Caleb Grice, Kent Mills, Tom Foote, Campbell Bushell, Aiden Saxon, George Roose, Lachlan Ross, Hakopa Paringatai, Jackson Botherway, Maxwell Kara, Miller Sturm, Toby Wales, Ollie Guerin, Cullen Parai, Koewyn Kearins-Te Whare, Carson Hunter, Nathan Stephens, Liam De Har-Elliott. Henderson’s Liston College continue to catch the eye in pre-season, with their latest effort being a 33-26 away win over Nelson College, last year’s National Top Four runners-up. With a school roll of just 845, Liston finished seventh in Auckland’s 1A competition in 2023, and 10th in 2022, but could be heading for a higher placing in 2025. Meanwhile Nelson have a new first XV coaching line-up this year. Greg Foe, the college’s former assistant coach, has moved up to head coach and is being assisted by Tim O’Malley, a recent retiree from professional rugby with over 50 appearances for Tasman Mako. Elsewhere, St Thomas of Canterbury beat St Peter’s (Auckland) 36-21 after leading 21-7 at the break, while touring Rosmini College beat King’s High (Dunedin) 27-21. Marlborough Boys’ College completed a short tour of the capital with an unblemished record, accounting for St Bernard’s College 30-7, then at a grey and windswept NZCIS, Marlborough blunted Wellington Premiership champions St Patrick’s College Silverstream 17-7. Marlborough were semifinalists in the Miles Toyota Premiership last year, a result not achieved in the Crusaders region competition since 2014. This suggests a similar outcome may be attainable this season. Marlborough’s scrum is bolstered by burly and mobile props Jordyn Gardner and Mason Nicklin, whose brother Rico Nicklin is a tireless and combative captain. Both brothers scored tries in the win against Silverstream. Centre Anru Erasmus was described by one spectator as “Snakey” – surely a reference to Conrad Smith – and with more possession Vilikesa Nawaqa will raise alarm bells. Marlborough’s head coach is Tonga Taumoefolau, father of eye-catching Moana Pasifika winger Kyren Taumoefolau.

Title: Wall Street And The Dollar Tumble As Investors Retreat Further From The United States

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street weakened Monday as investors worldwide get more skeptical about U.S. investments because of President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order. The S&P 500 sank 2.4% in another wipeout. That yanked the index that’s at the center of many 401(k) accounts 16% below its record set two months ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5%, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds and the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world’s safest investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say they’re having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. “We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. “The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.” That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin. On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle’s stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that its stock price had gone too high and that its brand has become too entwined with Elon Musk, who’s leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending. Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell. Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90. Gold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States’ standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market.

Title: CBS Settles Discrimination Lawsuit Over Alleged Racial Quotas for Hiring TV Writers

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 12:53:40 PM PDT by nickcarraway The deal aligns with companies across Hollywood stepping back from DEI policies. Parent company Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance.CBS Studios has settled a lawsuit from a script coordinator for SEAL Team, who accused parent company Paramount of carrying illegal diversity quotas that discriminate against straight white men. Lawyers for both sides on Friday informed the court of a deal to settle the case. They noted that the “action and all claims and defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice,” meaning the lawsuit can’t be refiled, according to the filing. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. The settlement aligns with companies across Hollywood rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid a larger retreat from initiatives under that label in the private sector driven by the government. That includes Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which earlier this year eliminated staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity, sex and gender. The company also stopped collecting gender and diversity data for most U.S. job applicants and tying its employee incentive program to DEI goals, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down race-conscious admissions in universities and federal mandates that “require changes in the way our company approaches inclusion moving forward.” Related Stories Kathy Bates as Matty with Skye P. Marshall in the season finale. TV "Who the Hell Are You?": 'Matlock' Creator Answers Key Questions From Finale, Teasing Season 2 Padma Lakshmi TV Padma Lakshmi to Host Cooking Competition Series for CBS Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices. The court overseeing the case later rebuffed Paramount’s bid to dismiss the case. The lawsuit was settled as Paramount Global continues to seek regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who sent a letter to Comcast in February saying that he was investigating DEI policies, has asserted his authority over the sale due to the transfer of broadcast licenses. The agency continues to investigate CBS News’ handling of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

TV "Who the Hell Are You?": 'Matlock' Creator Answers Key Questions From Finale, Teasing Season 2 Padma Lakshmi TV Padma Lakshmi to Host Cooking Competition Series for CBS Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices.

Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

They noted that the “action and all claims and defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice,” meaning the lawsuit can’t be refiled, according to the filing. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. The settlement aligns with companies across Hollywood rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid a larger retreat from initiatives under that label in the private sector driven by the government. That includes Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which earlier this year eliminated staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity, sex and gender.

Title: Pundit Explains Why He Believes Ripple’s XRP Price Has Already Been Determined

In a bold claim that has sparked debate in the crypto community, market pundit Versan Alajjarah asserts that XRP’s future price has already been predetermined by major financial institutions long before retail investors entered the market. Alajjarah’s argument comes even as XRP price continues to lag despite Ripple’s recent major wins like the XRP legal battle with the SEC and expanding ecosystem. In a recent article titled “XRP Price Already Set: What Global Institutions Know,” the pundit outlined a theory comparing XRP’s current situation to traditional pre-IPO processes. “The price of XRP has already been determined,” he stated, a position he’s maintained since 2022. According to his analysis, just as large institutional investors negotiate share prices before a company goes public, global financial entities like central banks, JP Morgan, BlackRock, and the IMF have already established XRP’s true value behind closed doors. “XRP is being adopted by the world’s largest financial players behind closed doors, and they have already agreed on a price for the technology’s use in their financial systems,” Alajjarah explained. He pointed to Ripple’s integration into financial systems of various central banks worldwide as evidence of this pre-arranged adoption. The Swan Capital founder further distinguishes between two XRP price realities. First, the institutional price, which is allegedly set through private negotiations for cross-border transactions and blockchain interoperability, and the retail price, which is currently subject to market speculation and manipulation. Notably, while he didn’t specify the exact set figure, he suggested the institutional price will “far exceed” current market values, potentially reaching “three to four-digit ranges” to facilitate multi-trillion-dollar financial transactions globally. “Central banks and large financial institutions aren’t going to transact in XRP at 50 cents. They need stability and confidence in the price when using XRP for large-scale settlements,” he noted, adding, “Retail price action is irrelevant to the larger institutional game already underway.” He believes XRP’s true value will only become apparent once its full role in the global financial system is realized. That said, the theory has generated mixed reactions within the crypto community. Blockchain enthusiast Jason Vonhunk rejected the prediction, stating, “It will never be triple digits. Ever. $100 = $10 trillion market cap. That’s Bitcoin’s entire global market cap, six times.” Others supported Alajjarah’s view, with one commenter noting, “Having done an IPO and capital raises on the stock market, this is the long-term reality, eventually.” Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently confirmed that a Ripple IPO is “possible, but not a priority.” However, although no official timeline has been set, speculation around a potential year-end IPO continues to grow. For XRP holders, a Ripple IPO could be a double-edged sword—bringing both opportunity and uncertainty. On the positive side, going public would likely generate significant buzz and credibility for Ripple, potentially accelerating adoption of its technology and XRP’s price.

Title: Strategy Increases Total Holdings To 538,200 BTC As Over 13,000 Institutions Are Exposed To The Bitcoin-Buying Firm

Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has revealed that over 13,000 institutions now have direct exposure to the firm. The Bitcoin treasury company’s most recent acquisition of 6,556 BTC brought its total holdings to 538,200 BTC, valued at over $46 billion. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) is quickly becoming one of the key on-ramps into Bitcoin, not just for Wall Street but also for everyday investors, pension funds, and institutions worldwide. “Based on public data as of Q1 2025, over 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts hold MSTR directly. An estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios,” Saylor wrote on X. Strategy’s increasing popularity among retail and institutional investors is noteworthy as the firm siphons capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into Strategy amassing more BTC, gradually boosting the price of the supply-capped crypto. Ironically, Wall Street giant Vanguard Group, known for its unwavering anti-Bitcoin stance, is still the top MSTR holder with over 16 million shares, despite reducing its stake by 6% in Q4 2024. Some other top institutions that hold Strategy stock include BlackRock, UBS Asset Management AG, State Street Global Advisors, Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley. As reported by ZyCrypto, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) joined the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index in December 2024 after witnessing tremendous gains during that year. The MSTR stock has gained 5.73% on a year-to-date basis. Interestingly, it has outperformed the Nasdaq-100, which is down 13%. Meanwhile, Strategy bought an additional 6,556 Bitcoin for $555.8 million between April 14 and April 20, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. $MSTR has acquired 6,556 BTC for ~$555.8 million at ~$84,785 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 12.1% YTD 2025. As of 4/20/2025, @Strategy holds 538,200 $BTC acquired for ~$36.47 billion at ~$67,766 per bitcoin. https://t.co/YxUq6mHzca The purchase was funded through proceeds from the sale of its own shares to investors via ongoing stock sale programs. Between April 14 and April 20, Strategy sold 1.76 million shares of its Class A common stock (MSTR) and over 91,000 shares of a preferred stock series (STRK), raising a total of $555.5 million to fund the Bitcoin buy. The latest purchase pushes Strategy’s total stash to 538,200 BTC, purchased at an average price of $67,766 per coin. Overall, the Saylor-led company has spent $36.47 billion implementing its Bitcoin strategy. The price of Bitcoin is currently hovering at around $87,000. At that price, Strategy’s BTC cache is worth around $46.8 billion, marking a paper profit of approximately $10 billion. The company is committed to boosting its holdings after setting a goal of raising a whopping $42 billion by the end of 2027 to scoop up more BTC, regardless of market conditions.

Title: As Stocks Tumble Again, Donald Lashes Out At 'Major Loser' Jerome Powell

The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low, and stocks are tumbling again today. Meanwhile, Donald weighed in to blame his tariff tantrums Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, while casting a conspiracy theory involving "Sleepy Joe Biden" and Kamala Harris. '“Preemptive Cuts” in Interest Rates are being called for by many," Lumpy wrote on Truth Social. "With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other “things” trending down, there is virtually No Inflation." Fact check: Excluding food and energy, prices rose 2.8% in March. According to a study from SmartAsset, "While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before — tripling the general rate of inflation." "With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates," It added. "NOW. Europe has already “lowered” seven times. Powell has always been “To Late,” except when it came to the Election period when he lowered in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected. How did that work out?" To late, eh? The Stable Genius™ is referring to the European Central Bank (ECB) lowering interest rates for the seventh time since last June. However, the ECB took this action in response to concerns about trade tensions and their potential impact on the economic recovery. It's because of Donald's tariffs. Powell said last week that inflation is likely to go up as the cost of US tariffs makes its way to consumers. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that he believes the U.S. economy has weakened to the point where growth may turn negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said. He's right. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said on Sunday. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” We're going to have to hear his whining for over 3 1/2 years more. He will never stop. He's only been in office for a couple of months, and look what he's done to the global economy already.
