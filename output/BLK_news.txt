More Info Investors continue to bet on the AI boom, but this year they see energy and power providers as the most compelling opportunities to increase exposure to the AI theme, the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, said in its 2026 Investment Directions report this week. Respondents in a recent survey of hundreds of BlackRock clients believe in the AI theme and its value, but they are seeking to diversify in and around AI, expanding their exposure beyond the Magnificent Seven, hyperscalers, and Big Tech. More than half—54%—of BlackRock’s survey participants believe that energy providers are the most compelling opportunity to increase exposure to the AI theme this year. A total of 37% responded in the multi-select question that infrastructure would be the most compelling opportunity around AI, and just 20% see the U.S. mega-cap tech giants as the most compelling play in AI. That’s not to say that investors are backing off from the AI boom, as only 7% believe the AI theme is a bubble. They just seek greater diversification around the hottest theme in the markets in recent years. And power supply, with energy providers, is the biggest growth opportunity, according to BlackRock’s survey of clients. “As investors look to build exposure to the AI theme, interest is broadening from core AI technology to the wider ecosystems underpinning it,” BlackRock said in its report. “In our recent survey, clients highlighted energy and power providers as the most compelling opportunity, amid accelerating AI-driven power demand.” Investors, therefore, have started to bet on the most critical bottleneck in the AI boom—the soaring electricity demand to power the data centers. “Today’s US market is historically concentrated – but the earnings outlook isn’t. With the rest of the S&P 500 expected to catch up to the Magnificent 7 in EPS growth through 2026, it’s increasingly important to risk-manage mega cap and AI exposure while also capturing differentiated upside opportunities,” Ibrahim Kanan, Head of Core US Equity, Fundamental Equities, at BlackRock, noted in comments to the report. The global AI race is also an energy race, as AI is highly energy-intensive, according to the world’s biggest asset manager. Goldman Sachs Research, for example, expects data center power demand to surge 175% by 2030 compared to 2023 levels. This jump in electricity demand would be the equivalent of adding another Top 10 power-consuming country. The investment bank continues to see the reliability of power and water as “a multi-year investment theme amid rising demand growth, aging infrastructure and Adaptation to extreme temperatures/weather events,” Goldman’s analysts wrote in an October report. “We continue to see attractive investment opportunities across the power supply chain driven by power demand growth acceleration — in the US, to levels not seen since the 1990,” Goldman Sachs says. So big is the demand that the aging grid infrastructure in key regional U.S. markets cannot cope with all requests, with grid investments lagging behind soaring power demand. At the current rate of interconnection requests and grid capacity, the U.S. could face a power crunch by 2030, Samantha Dart, Goldman Sachs’ co-head of global commodities research, said at a conference earlier this month. Goldman Sachs research analysts said in an October report that data center power demand growth alone would accelerate total U.S. power demand growth through 2030 by 1.2 percentage points to an overall level of 2.6%, the highest growth in America’s electricity demand since the 1990s. “We aren’t adding enough capacity,” Dart said this week at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech and Utilities Conference in Miami, adding that if the issue remains unaddressed, the U.S. could lose the AI race with China.

Title: The Fed–Trump battle is rattling crypto markets: Bitcoin caught in the crossfire

Time Published: 2026-01-14T20:00:56Z

Bitcoin looks strong. but technical indicators suggest something else may be brewing. For years, the crypto market followed a simple rule wherein lower interest rates usually push asset prices higher. But as 2026 begins, a major political clash is showing that liquidity alone isn’t enough. Tensions between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have grown into a serious institutional conflict. This has put crypto in a rare push-and-pull situation. On one side, the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance and push for lower rates should, in theory, be bullish for Bitcoin [BTC] and digital assets. On the other hand, the attack on the Federal Reserve’s independence has unsettled large institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity. Adding fuel to the fire, The Kobeissi Letter posted about President Trump’s recent remarks, where he said, “When the market goes up, they [Fed] should lower rates.” In his view, the Federal Reserve isn’t protecting stability but rather holding the economy back just as growth picks up. Talking about the impact this will have on the crypto market, Farzam Ehsani, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange VALR, said, ” The very fact of a criminal investigation against the current Fed chairman appears to be a tool of pressure, signaling a deep rift within the American establishment.” Ehsani added, “For the crypto market, the situation is paradoxical.” He highlights that Bitcoin is currently acting as both a safety net and a speculative gamble. On one hand, investors are buying it as a hedge because they are losing trust in a politically pressured U.S. dollar, viewing decentralized code as more reliable than government-controlled policy. On the other hand, the sheer chaos of this legal battle is scaring big institutional players into selling risky assets to protect their cash. Therefore, the next move depends entirely on who wins. If Powell holds his ground, the market will likely stabilize and return to normal trends. But if the White House successfully forces interest rates down to 1%, a wave of cheap money could trigger a massive rally for both Bitcoin and Gold. Echoing similar sentiments, Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto app NoOnes, noted, “A rate cut could increase market liquidity, which would positively affect cryptocurrency growth. Perhaps this expectation is driving gold and Bitcoin higher amid red indices, making them not just assets but a refuge from chaos.” Youssef believes that in today’s market, Bitcoin is playing a confusing double role. On one hand, it is rising alongside gold as a safety net for investors who are losing faith in the U.S. dollar due to the intense political battle between the White House and the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the threat of global conflicts is making big institutional players nervous, causing them to sell off risky assets during U.S. trading hours. Yet despite the uncertainty, the total crypto market value has held up well, rising 3.22% in the past 24 hours to $3.24 trillion. The Fear and Greed Index sits at 52, or neutral, showing that investors are not fully confident yet, as per CoinMarketCap. At the same time, many crypto assets are entering overbought levels, raising the risk of a short-term pullback. Still, analysts are suggesting the Justice Department’s probe into Powell could ultimately drive investors toward safe havens like gold and emerging alternatives such as Bitcoin.

Title: Bloomberg Analyst Urges 4-Year Bitcoin HODL Strategy as BitWise Survey Reveals Surging Institutional Demand

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the current market data suggests investors should hold Bitcoin for at least 4 years. The remarks came amid an influx of Wall Street institutions into the crypto space, as a survey by VanEck reveals that 99% of financial advisors will likely maintain their positions in 2026. In an X post, Balchunas noted that the “boomers” who recently ventured into crypto are unlikely to sell in the near term, as they likely have a long-term HODL strategy. Therefore, any investor buying Bitcoin should consider holding it for at least 4 years. “The boomers are not tourists. Which is smart imo. If you’re going to buy btc data shows you should commit to at least a four-year holding period, like a self-imposed lock-up period,” he said. Balchunas was responding to an X post by BitWise CIO Matt Hougan, who noted that nearly all the financial advisors who dipped their toes in crypto in 2025 will likely continue to do so in 2026. In the survey, 57% of financial advisors said they plan to increase their allocation to crypto in 2026, while 42% plan to maintain their positions. Meanwhile, only 1% of financial advisors said that they would reduce their positions. Balchunas’s remarks come as Wall Street doubles down on crypto. Currently, nearly all the top financial institutions in the US, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Morgan Stanley, are dipping their toes into the crypto space. The Bitwise survey comes in the wake of surging inflows into multiple crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are currently available in the US. As ZyCrypto reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs had their best day in three months after amassing more than $750 million in inflows on January 13. The surging inflows coincided with a rise in Bitcoin’s price above $95,000, marking its biggest daily close since October. Other crypto ETFs also amassed significant inflows. Ethereum saw $129 million in inflows, while XRP ETFs saw $12.98 million in inflows. Meanwhile, Solana spot ETFs amassed $5.91 million in inflows during the day. Hence, as financial advisors plan to maintain or increase their crypto allocations this year, the Bitcoin price could be set for significant gains.

Title: State Street to invest up to ₹580 crore in Groww AMC

The proposed investment of up to ₹580 crore will be split between a secondary share purchase of about ₹381 crore from Groww’s parent entity and a primary capital infusion of nearly ₹199 crore into Groww AMC, the filings showed. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. As part of the deal, State Street Investment Management will acquire up to 23 per cent of Groww AMC’s fully diluted share capital. Despite this, the US-based asset manager will hold less than 5 per cent of the voting rights in the mutual fund arm. Post-transaction, Groww AMC will cease to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd, the listed parent of the Groww platform. Groww entered the mutual fund business in 2023 after acquiring the asset management company from Indiabulls, marking its formal foray into the asset management space. Since the acquisition, the company has expanded its product offerings amid a sharp rise in retail participation in capital markets and growing adoption of mutual funds among first-time investors. “India stands out as a market of immense opportunity, with a rising middle class, favourable demographics, and a rapid shift toward embracing modern investment products,” said Yie-Hsin Hung, chief executive of State Street Investment Management. “Our partnership with Groww AMC allows us to participate directly in the growth of India’s domestic asset management market, deliver a range of investment exposures to a broader population, and build a pipeline of Indian exposures for global distribution,” she added. Welcoming the investment, Groww said the partnership would help deepen its asset management capabilities. “State Street Investment Management is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and we are delighted to welcome them as an investor and strategic partner in Groww AMC,” said Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief operating officer of Groww. “This partnership will enable us to bring global best practices and sophisticated investment products to Indian investors, strengthening our long-term commitment to building a world-class asset management platform in India,” he added. State Street’s entry into India’s mutual fund space comes amid growing global interest in the country’s asset management industry. The move follows a similar push by rival BlackRock, which recently formed a joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd to tap into India’s expanding domestic savings and investment market.

Investing Stocks were walloped on Tuesday after JPMorgan missed analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates. The good news on Tuesday was the December consumer price index report that showed inflation hitting the 2.7% target, while core inflation came in below estimates at 2.6% Investors will be watching the other big banks that will report this week after the somewhat worrisome JPMorgan print. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower after the January rally hit a wall on Wednesday, with all major indices falling, and the selling looks set to continue today. The main culprit yesterday was JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) shares, which took a hit after missing analyst estimates for the quarter. The banking giant posted $4.63 per share, below the expected $4.86, primarily due to a surprise decline in investment banking fees and costs associated with the Apple Card portfolio. Revenue slightly beat expectations, and trading and net interest income showed strength, making it a mixed report. That noted, the bank was priced to perfection, so the sellers traded on the print, especially after Jamie Dimon warned of risks. The Dow Jones Industrials took the biggest shot Tuesday, closing down 0.88% at 49,191, led by JPMorgan’s decline. The S&P 500 closed 0.19% lower at 6,963, while the Nasdaq finished 0.10% lower at 23,709. The Russell 2000, which has been on a roll in 2026, closed at 2,632, down 0.11%. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday, with buyers leaning to the middle and longer maturities, while there was some selling in the short-term T-bills. The positive news on inflation overshadowed the feud between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as the Justice Department’s subpoenas. The 30-year-long bond finished trading on Tuesday at 4.83%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.18% Energy stocks were the big winners as prices were higher across the energy complex on Tuesday. Prices for the major benchmarks rose primarily due to escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran, with concerns about potential supply disruptions outweighing increased supply prospects from Venezuela following President Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran, which could start impacting global supply routes. Brent Crude finished the session at $65.38, up 2.36%, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $61.02, up 2.55%. Natural gas ended the day flat at $3.42. After a solid rally to start the day and new record highs, Gold reversed midday and ended the day 0.25% lower at $4,586. The likely reason for the slight pullback was profit-taking. Still, sales were limited by ongoing geopolitical tensions with Iran and by uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s new investigation into the Fed. The weaker-than-expected US inflation report also supported expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which typically benefit gold and will likely do so going forward. Silver continued to march higher, finishing the day at $86.80, up 1.95%. The cryptocurrency market saw broad gains, with major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rising, supported by positive regulatory news and resumed institutional inflows, as the overall crypto market capitalization rose back over $3.2 trillion. Senator Tim Scott released a draft of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which aims to provide more explicit rules for digital assets, and that was perceived positively by traders. At 8A EST, Bitcoin traded at $94,990, while Ethereum was quoted at $3,293. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 14 2026 by Duncan Riley JumpCloud Inc., which offers a unified platform for identity, access and devices, today unvieled new artificial intelligence capabilities to fuel safe innovation by allowing organizations to accelerate AI adoption and ensure compliance and control for all types of identities. JumpCloud’s new features are designed to allow organizations to see, secure and automate AI management and to allow them to focus on proactive information technology enablement and safe innovation. The company says the approach gives organizations a competitive edge and helps them stay compliant. The new capabilities provide control and intelligent IT foundations that are necessary for managing AI usage across the entire enterprise. Using the new capabilities, organizations can securely integrate all their AI tools and speed up their path to success. Key benefits include the ability to automatically detect shadow AI usage and hidden machine identities. Organizations gain centralized insights into who is using what, where and with what data risks. Users can also find data instantly, the company says, including surfacing critical data with natural language to navigate the platform. The capabilities include zero trust for AI agents, with support for managing machine-to-machine and AI-to-resource access via a unified policy. A complementary AI Admin Assistant streamlines day-to-day operations by handling high-frequency administrative tasks through conversational intelligence. Other features include the ability to generate rapid, reliable scripts that cut down the time and effort needed to write or debug scripts and integration with existing AI tools. “The market has been selling fear of AI, pushing organizations to simply ‘detect and block’ new technologies,” said Joel Rennich, senior vice president of product management at JumpCloud. “We believe that stifles progress. By using our platform, AI becomes an engine driving immediate efficiency across the organization. We are enabling the natural human desire for efficiency — user-led innovation — safely, turning a corporate liability into a source of competitive advantage.” The company was previously in the news on Jan. 8 when it announced that it had acquired MacSolution Tecnologia Ltd., the largest managed service provider in the Americas and an existing JumpCloud partner, for an undisclosed price. JumpCloud is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $408 million across ten rounds, including a Series F round of $159 million on a $2.65 billion valuation in September 2021. Investors in the company include Sapphire Ventures, BlackRock Inc., Blue Owl Capital Inc., Whale Rock Capital Management, Sands Capital Management, Endeavor Catalyst GP, General Atlantic, H.I.G.

Title: Ireland to experience more extreme weather - expert
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/2026/0114/1553066-ireland-climate-change/
Time Published: 2026-01-14T12:46:01Z

Ireland will experience more flooding events and extreme weather events unless it transitions away from fossil fuels, Met Éireann climatologist Paul Moore has said. It comes as the European Union Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that 2025 was the third warmest year on record. Speaking on RTÉ's Today With David McCullagh, Mr Moore said: "The higher the temperatures go, the more extreme events that we can expect." He said the 1.5C level of global warming above pre-industrial levels threshold was laid out so that it was deemed possible we could keep under to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "That hasn’t happened, so we are continuing towards that trend at an accelerated rate. The higher the temperatures go, the more moisture that can hold in the atmosphere. "That means more flooding events and more extreme weather events for us," Mr Moore said. "Unless we can bring them (greenhouse gas emissions) down to zero emissions or to net-zero emissions, then the temperatures will continue to rise. "It is putting out the call to get our act together globally and to bring down emissions so we can stop this trend," Mr Moore said. Mr Moore said the forecaster did some rapid attribution studies with Maynooth University’s ICARUS Climate Research Centre called the 'WASITUS’ study, which he said found that Wexford rainfall due to Storm Claudia was made 12% heavier because of a warming climate and that it is twice as likely. He added that a study done for last summer showed that it was the warmest summer on record in Ireland and was 40 times more likely to be a record-breaking summer in terms of temperature than pre-industrial times. "What once was a 600-year event is now a one in 15-year event, due to the warming climate," he said. He said the positive drawn from the report is that the technology is out there for us to "transition away from fossil fuels". "That is the positive as long as we do it," he said. Technology improving, says public policy advisor Meanwhile, public policy advisor Oisín Coughlan said it [climate change] "has been coming faster than the models predicted than when we hoped when we signed the Paris Agreement". He reiterated Mr Moore’s point on the technology that is out there, which he said has "improved hugely over the last ten years". Solar is now the cheapest way to make electricity everywhere in the world, he said. He stressed that the "technology has really moved but the politics has got worse". "I really think the next five years is actually a battle between the technology and the politics. The politics needs to catch up with the technology," he said. Mr Coughlan said these positives are cheaper electricity, less dependence on Russian or other fossil fuels leading to warmer homes and lower fuel bills. However, he said "getting there is the challenge". He said the Government needs to do a lot more for people on the expense of the retrofit process and to work with groups that are in touch with those in energy poverty. "We have to be much more proactive about how we do this and we need to accompany people through what is a challenging process, but the outcome will be very positive," Mr Coughlan said. He said removing our reliance on fossil fuels is in our own "national interest" and not about "some whimsical environmental desire". Mr Coughlan said 20 years ago it was hard to make people interested in climate change in Ireland. "Now we are seeing it, Storm Éowyn, the floods in Midleton, the floods in Wexford last year. We all know that the rain now is more intensive bursts... and the warmer summers and the warmer nights… we are seeing it here," he said. On infrastructure, Mr Coughlan said "our country isn’t built for the climate that we are moving into". "So as well as cutting pollution and saving money, we also do need to start the adaption, the coping of what is about to come," he said. © RTÉ 2026.

Title: California's Billionaires Rage at Huge Tax Bill to Fund Illegal Migrants' Health Subsidies

California’s stock market billionaires are angrily denouncing a proposed tax to fund healthcare for the millions of illegal migrants they welcomed into their state. The tech sector “is getting what they had coming ….[after] pushing for open borders and unbridled employment visas,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, which opposes the H-1B program. He continued: A strong, middle class that can form families, pay for college educations without going into debt, and pay for health care, doesn’t need this kind of a [tax] grift … but now it’s on the tech bros to pay for the health care for all these illegal immigrants — and all the healthcare workers who have to service them. “You funded Democrats and the people who censored, locked down, and tormented us. That was your political gamble,” said a message from conservative activist Mike Cernovich. In a later tweet, he added: 90% of Tech and VC [executives] are cultural Marxists with a hatred of Americans. That’s why they want infinite [subordinate] H-1B’s. They hate [citizens]. But, he added, “There’s a split happening … We can take back the country with 10% of them.” Billionaire Rethink The political drama is forcing many billionaires to recognize that their pro-migration policies are importing resentment and poverty, so shifting national politics against their pocketbooks. The proposed tax is likely to appear on California’s ballot in November. Once passed, the measure would require roughly 200 billionaires to pay a share of the controlling value they own in companies, including companies they founded. Proponents say the ballot would raise $100 billion, mostly for healthcare programs. On January 10, the Wall Street Journal quoted an official at the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, saying, “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives…the few [billionaires] who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a supposed moderate Democrat, has supported the proposed tax. He needs the support of Democratic-aligned unions for his expected presidential campaign. Many billionaires are blasting the tax as a crude wealth-grab — and some are leaving the state. “I love California … but stupid wealth tax proposals like this make it irresponsible for me not to plan leaving the state,” said DoorDash founder Andy Fang, who gained billions by creating an industry of poorly-paid migrant delivery workers. The original founders of Google Inc., for example, have reportedly moved themselves to low-tax Florida. “That math doesn’t math,” said Chamath Palihapitiya, a Silicon Valley investor with ethnic roots in Sri Lanka, which is a small island off of southern India. “Everyone that is potentially touched by this will now leave, and all that will result is a massive hole in California’s finances that you will be forced to fill.” The Billionaires’ Bill for Migration Some of the outraged billionaires recognize that mass migration created the political base for the wealth grab. “After blindly funding the Left for years, Silicon Valley is finally realizing what time it is. Dinner time,” said David Sacks, a California investor and author who is now advising Trump’s administration and moving his legal address to Texas. Silicon Valley is “on the menu,” he added. “The blast radius, however, of healthcare for illegal aliens, will be the end of Silicon Valley” in California, said Palihapitiya. “I care about two issues: I care about immigration and re-establishing the deterrent capacity of America,” Palantir CEO Alex Karp told the New York Times in December. “We are on the side of working-class Americans.” RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers “This has always been inevitable and is not due to Newsom or any individual,” said Elon Musk, who is increasingly critical of mass migration. “The Democratic Party is utterly controlled by the unions and the trial lawyers and California is a one-party state.” Those concerns were echoed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on January 12: Open immigration would be something interesting if we gave people nothing [in welfare]. Because if we gave them nothing, if they weren’t smart enough, capable, entrepreneurial enough, driven enough, they would starve to death, and so they wouldn’t stay here, they would self deport. But if you give them welfare, and you’re going to give them food stamps, and you’re gonna give them housing and you give them this, everybody’s gonna come and just leech off of us, and we’re going to pay and pay and pay. Separately, a growing number of American CEOs — including some left-wingers — are increasingly alarmed at Muslim migration into the United States. They include Larry Fink, founder of the giant BlackRock investment firm, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook and Meta, and investor David Sacks. Similarly, many writers and advocates have stepped back from full-throated advocacy for migration amid the growing clout of Islamic activists, who now include the new Mayor of New York City. Buying a Fix The billionaires are spending some of their cash to win a political fix. “It’s time for Silicon Valley to actually get involved and organized in California,” said Gerry Tan, an investor in many tech companies. “I will fight,” said Fang, the DoorDash founder who has funded many prior political battles. On January 13, they won support from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is planning his own run for President in 2028. “This will be defeated — there’s no question in my mind … I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state,” he told the New York Times, which added: While Mr. Newsom helped stop past wealth tax bills in the State Capitol, the new proposal is being driven by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West through the initiative process and beyond the reach of his veto pen. … “I want to be adamant and very clear: This is a ballot measure we are putting on the ballot,” [Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for the labor union] said. “We’re going to have voters vote on it in November.” But the billionaires have yet to offer any concessions to the many millions of American voters who have lost wages and wealth amid the billionaires’ stock-market boom and far-left political advocacy. Those wealth-sharing concessions could include elite support for ending the Extraction Migration economy that damages ordinary Americans. The billionaires might even offer curbs on the H-1B visa program that is deliberately used to push millions of American college graduates out of productive and innovative careers. “They should take the same lesson that an element of the business community took in the 1920s,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He added: They saw the political changes related to [1920s] anarchism … and immigration, and they concluded that it might be worth paying a nickel an hour more [in wages] to have American workers instead of these kinds of political consequences. Obviously, the nickel an hour doesn’t apply anymore here, but it’s the same concept: cheap [migrant] labor not only creates a lot of welfare costs and political costs. In 1924, Congress passed an immigration reform that set the stage for the United States’ dominance in the 20th Century. Migration Grows Poverty The billionaires may be able to buy a short-term victory. But they are struggling against a self-created political tide in many states where voters have been pushed on their backs by flat wages and rising home costs caused by migration. In those states, many progressives are eager to drain vast wealth and political power from the billionaire class for their left-wing priorities. States should “follow examples like what is being proposed in Rhode Island, Michigan, and other states,” said a January 12 press statement from a union-led group titled May Day Strong. “A millionaire tax [in Massachusetts] has generated at least $5.7 billion in revenue since 2023 to pay for schools, public transit, and infrastructure,” the “Tax the Rich Policy” statement said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) is slamming the pro-migration technology donors in California, including FWD.us leader Reid Hoffman, as well as Dustin Moskovitz, Marc Andreessen, and Patrick Collison: Hoffman wants Democratic candidates to stand with the billionaires for higher [water and electricity] costs. Running on small, vague ideas that may also raise costs for families—instead of on full-throated, economic populist ideas—is a terrible plan for winning elections. In November, predicted Lynn, “anyone who isn’t a billionaire is going to eventually back this [ballot measure], because that’s how democracy works.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: “And the Billionaires Are Laughing Somewhere in America”

This article by veteran war correspondent and GR associate editor Felicity Arbuthnot was first published in 2015. While the world trembles under the crescendo of bombs, “billionaires are laughing somewhere in America.” —Global Research, January 14, 2026 *** “If I could shed a tear for every home that bombs destroy, I’d never stop crying “If I could hold each shattered body, each baby stilled at birth, I’d have no time for loneliness, I’d spend all my days embracing the people of this savaged earth, “And the billionaires are laughing somewhere in America.” (Song for Basra, David Rovics.) If you have ever mentally yelled at the screen, radio or hard copy when looking for truth, fact and balance in the news and wondered how much of the mainstream media is bought or biased, the answer is simple. Just two examples, the US and UK. In the US six corporations own 90% of the media – but these corporations in turn must satisfy their shareholders – each one who holds them financial hostage to the tune of million of dollars. The list of investors is long (1) but a few examples (2013 figures): Gannett owns USA Today and local newspapers & TV stations in 37 US states including the Detroit Free Press, Indianapolis Star and Cincinnati Inquirer. Just one of many mega investors is JP Morgan Asset Management who hold 21,915,328 shares at a 2013 value of $330,702,000. In the UK there are twelve major newspaper groups: “Over a quarter (27.3 per cent) of the press is owned by Lord Rothermere and 24.9 per cent by Rupert Murdoch – between them these two men have over 50 per cent of the printed press.” (2) Figures are also from 2013. Nine of these groups are supporters of David Cameron’s Tory Party which enjoined in murdering Libya’s Leader, near all his family and small grandchildren, reducing the formerly flourishing country to a ruined, failed state – with large swathes of the British public buying into the murderous carnage thanks to the war fever drummed up by the Cameron backing media. This pattern of ownership is broadly replicated throughout the West where now the same misrepresentation of Syria is in journalistic overdrive. The BBC is vying to be leader of the pack talking of “civil war” with one Middle East correspondent even dropping the last vestige of “impartiality” and declaring “Assad must go.” The entire organization long abandoned any pretense of professionalism and impartiality even ditching his status and title of “President.” In contrast to the Mainstream media, Global Research has no $multi-million donors, but as the world again reaches yet another manufactured and most dangerous crisis, truly independent analysis is the vital weapon for the non-partisan truth, knowledge and a tool for prevention from repeating the tragedies of the past. It is, as Dr Binoy Kampmark, distinguished GR contributor and lecturer at RMIT University, Melbourne has said: “a vital democratic forum.” Of course, as Global Research writers pointed out (3) there is no “civil war” in Syria, the country’s nightmare was plotted from inside the US Embassy in Damascus in 2006 with terrorists from over ninety countries committing unspeakable atrocities, then returning to their own countries with impunity, as recent events in Paris demonstrated. Click image to donate Global Research has provided extensive coverage of the US-led war against Iraq and Syria. Obama’s fake humanitarian campaign consists in protecting the “moderate terrorists” while going after the ISIS “bad guys” who happen to be supported covertly by the CIA. Now a further excuse for another illegal onslaught against Syria is being plotted after a Russian fighter jet was shot down on Tuesday, allegedly having strayed into Turkish air space which Russia emphatically denies; moreover, the two pilots who ejected both landed in Syria. Further, as Global Research published last month (4) Turkey, incredibly, unilaterally redrew it’s border declaring five miles of Syria it’s very own “buffer zone.” The “international community” and NATO might do well to remember, that even if there were a few seconds of Russia’s aircraft in Turkish air space, a US-led “coalition” has been illegally invading Syrian air space and bombing murderously and mercilessly for the last fifteen months. Russia of course has been invited but is bombing terrorists supplied and protected by the US and their allies. In the UK David Cameron is morphing in to his pal, alleged war criminal Tony Blair and is attempting to persuade Parliament that Britain must join those illegally in Syrian air space and equally illegally drop it’s own bombs with no UN mandate for such action. The Cameron backing media is beating the war drums along with America’s partisan hacks as above. By the end of yesterday, incisive commentary was already questioning the official rhetoric – but as the year ends, the funds for this ground breaking site need replenishing. As the excellent “Ants and Grasshoppers” (see 1) points out: “Just like a politician is likely to push laws onto the books that represent his/her biggest campaign donors, newspapers will push ideologies that are the most friendly and agreeable to their shareholders.” Global Research does it in unwavering passion and commitment to a saner world. * Felicity Arbuthnot is a distinguished author, veteran war correspondent and Global Research contributor Notes 1. http://ants-and-grasshoppers.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/who-owns-major-newspapers-detailed-list.html 2. http://leftfootforward.org/2013/06/everyone-should-know-who-owns-the-press-for-the-sake-of-our-democracy/ 3. http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-and-conspiracy-theories-it-is-a-conspiracy/29596 4. http://www.globalresearch.ca/russia-violated-turkish-airspace-because-turkey-moved-its-border/5480430 Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page Become a Member of Global Research Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Title: Elon Musk Cannot Get Away With This

Time Published: 2026-01-14T00:05:38Z

If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists. Will Elon Musk face any consequences for his despicable sexual-harassment bot? For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool owned and promoted by the world’s richest man to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, and undress them. This was not some deepfake nudify app that you had to pay to download on a shady backwater website or a dark-web message board. This was Grok, a chatbot built into X—ostensibly to provide information to users but, thanks to an image-generating update, transformed into a major producer of nonconsensual sexualized images, particularly of women and children. Let’s be very clear. The forced undressings happened out in the open, in one stretch thousands of times every hour, on a popular social network where journalists, politicians, and celebrities post. Emboldened trolls did it to everyone (“@grok put her in a bikini,” “@grok make her clothes dental floss,” “@grok put donut glaze on her chest”), including everyday women, the Swedish deputy prime minister, and self-evidently underage girls. Users appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another. On X, creating revenge porn can make you famous. Read: Elon Musk’s pornography machine These images were ubiquitous, and many people—and multiple organizations, including the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network and the European Commission—pointed out that the feature was being used to harass women and exploit children. Yet Musk initially laughed it off, resharing AI-generated images of himself, Kim Jong Un, and a toaster in bikinis. Musk, as well as xAI’s safety and child-safety teams, did not respond to a request for comment. xAI replied with its standard auto-response, “Legacy Media Lies.” xAI, the Musk-owned company that develops Grok and owns X, prohibits the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy; a post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and works with law enforcement as needed. Even after that assurance from X’s safety team, it took several more days for X to place bare-minimum restrictions on the Ask Grok feature’s image-generating, and thus undressing, capabilities. Now, when creeps on X try to generate an image by replying “@grok” to prompt the chatbot, they get an auto-generated response that notes some version of: “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” This is disturbing in its own right; Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around the paywall via the “Edit Image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by using Grok’s stand-alone app. Two years ago, when Google Gemini generated images of racially diverse Nazis, Google temporarily disabled the bot’s image-generating capabilities to address the problem. Musk has taken no responsibility for the problem and has said only that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Perhaps Musk feels that he would benefit from baiting his critics into a censorship fight. He has repeatedly reshared posts that frame calls to regulate or ban his platform in response to the Grok undressing as leftist censorship, for instance reposting a meme calling such efforts “retarded” as well as a Grok-generated video of a woman applying lipstick captioned with a quote commonly attributed to Marilyn Monroe: “We are all born sexual creatures, thank God, but it’s a pity so many people despise and crush this natural gift.” Last week, as Musk’s chatbot was generating likely hundreds of thousands of these images, we reached out directly to X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, who didn’t reply. Within the hour, Rosemarie Esposito, X’s media-strategy lead, emailed us unprompted with her contact information, in case we had “any questions” in the future. We asked her a series of questions about the tool and how X could allow such a thing to operate. She did not reply. We’ve reached out multiple times to more than a dozen key investors listed in xAI’s two most recent public fundraising rounds—the latest of which, announced during this Grok-enabled sexual-harassment spree, valued the company at about $230 billion—to ask if they endorsed the use of X and Grok to generate and distribute nonconsensual sexualized images. These investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Management & Research Company, the Saudi firm Kingdom Holding Company, and the state-owned investment firms of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We asked whether they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products and, if yes, why they felt justified in continuing to invest in a company that has enabled the public sexual harassment of women and exploitation of children on the internet. BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and Baron Capital declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley initially told us that she could find no documentation that the company is a major investor in xAI. After we sent a public announcement from xAI that lists Morgan Stanley as a key investor in its Series C fundraising round, the spokesperson did not answer our questions. The other companies did not respond. We also reached out to several companies that provide the infrastructure for X and Grok—in other words, that allow these products to exist on the internet: Google and Apple, which offer both X and Grok on their app stores; Microsoft and Oracle, which run Grok on their cloud services; and Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok. We asked if they endorsed the use of these products to create nonconsensual sexual images of women and children, and whether they would take steps to prevent this from continuing. None responded except for Microsoft, which told us that it does not provide cloud services, chips, or hosting services for xAI other than offering the Grok language model—without image generation—on its enterprise platform, Microsoft Foundry. The silence says everything. As all of this unfolded, xAI made several major announcements: new Grok products for businesses; upgraded video-generating capabilities; that enormous fundraising round. Yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX’s headquarters in Texas and joined Musk for a press conference in which Hegseth said, “I want to thank you, Elon, and your incredible team” for bringing Grok to the military. (Later this year, Grok will join Google Gemini on a new Pentagon platform called GenAI.mil that the Defense Department says will offer advanced AI tools to military and civilian personnel.) We asked the DOD if it endorsed xAI’s sexualized material or if it would reconsider its partnership with the company in response. In a statement, a Pentagon official told us only that the department’s policy on the use of AI “fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations” and that “any unlawful activity” by its personnel “will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.” Read: What are people still doing on X? Government bodies in the United Kingdom, India, and the European Union have said that they will investigate X, while Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok, but Musk appears to be unfazed by these efforts—and also seems to be receiving help in brushing them off. Sarah B. Rogers, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, has said that, should the U.K. ban X, America “has a full range of tools that we can use to facilitate uncensored internet access in authoritarian, closed societies.” At the moment, Musk seems to be not only getting away with this but also reveling in it. Although governments appear to be furious at Musk, they also seem impotent. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the TAKE IT DOWN Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last Wednesday that the Grok-generated images “are unacceptable and a clear violation of” the law but that he was “encouraged that X has announced that they’re taking these violations seriously.” Throughout that same day, Grok continued to comply with user requests to undress people. Yesterday, Cruz posted on X a photo of himself with his arm around Musk and the caption “Always great seeing this guy 🚀.” And it’s already beginning to feel as if the scandal—the world’s richest man enabling the widespread harassment of women and children—is waning, crowded out by a new year of relentless news cycles. But this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet. Grok’s ability to undress minors is not, as Musk might have you think, an exercise in free-speech maximalism. It is, however, a speech issue: By turning sexual harassment and revenge porn into a meme with viral distribution, the platform is allowing its worst, most vindictive users to silence and intimidate anyone they desire. The retaliation on X has been obvious—women who’ve stood up in opposition to the tool have been met with anonymous trolls asking Grok to put them in a bikini. Social platforms have long leaned on the argument that they aren’t subject to the same defamation laws as publishers and media companies. But this latest debacle, Musk’s reaction, and the silence from so many of X’s investors and peer companies were all active choices—and symptoms of a broader crisis of impunity that’s begun to seep into American culture. They were the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs bowing to Donald Trump. Of financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors such as cryptocurrency and meme stocks—a braggadocious, “get the bag” ethos that has no room for greed or shame. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences. Few industries have been as brazen in their capitulation as Big Tech, which has dismantled its content-moderation systems to please the current administration. It’s a cynical and cowardly pivot, one that allows companies to continue to profit off harassment and extremism without worrying about the consequences of their actions. Deepfakes are not new, but xAI has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before. By matching viral distribution with this type of image creation, xAI has built a way to spread AI revenge porn and child-sexual-abuse material at scale. The end result is desensitizing: The sheer amount of exploitative content flooding the platform may eventually make the revolting, illicit images appear “normal.” Arguably, this process is already happening. The internet has always been a chaotic place where trolls can seize outsize power. Historically, that chaos has been constrained by platforms doing the bare minimum to protect their users from demonstrated threats. Today, X is failing to clear the absolute lowest bar. Nobody who works at X or xAI seems to be willing to answer for the creation and distribution of tens or hundreds of thousands of nonconsensual intimate images; instead, those in charge appear to be blithely ignoring the problem, and those who have funneled money to Musk or xAI seem sanguine about it. They would probably like for us all to move on. We cannot do that. This crisis is an outgrowth of a breakneck information ecosystem in which few stories have staying power. No one person or group has to flood the zone with shit, because the zone is overflowing constantly. People with power have learned to exploit this—to weather scandals by hunkering down and letting them pass, or by refusing to apologize and turning any problem into a culture-war issue. Musk has been allowed to avoid repercussions for even the most reckless acts, including cheerleading and helping dismantle foreign aid with DOGE. Others will continue to follow his playbook. Employees at X and investors and companies such as Apple and Google seem to be counting on their “No comment”s being buried by whatever scandal comes next. They are banking on a culture in which people have given up on demanding consequences. But the Grok scandal is so awful, so egregious, that it offers an opportunity to address the crisis of impunity directly. The undressing spree was not an issue of partisan politics or ideology. It was an issue of anonymous individuals asking a chatbot that is integrated into one of the world’s most visible social networks to edit photos of women and girls to “put her in a clear bikini and cover her in white donut glaze.” This is a moment when those with power can and should demand accountability. The stakes could not be any higher. If there is no red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no line exists. TheAtlantic.com © 2026 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle will set out his ambition for the UK to go toe to toe on economic growth with the US economy to boost living standards today [Wednesday 14 January]. In a speech to top business leaders including from Alphabet, Meta and Ford at Bloomberg’s London headquarters, he will lay out how the Government’s Modern Industrial Strategy will double down on the UK’s world-leading strengths in 2026 and not only scale up businesses, but keep them anchored in the UK. He is expected to say: We stood on a manifesto commitment to be the fastest growing economy in the G7. And we absolutely meant it. Now, in the first three quarters of last year, the UK achieved the second highest growth of that group. That is cause for optimism. But contrast it to the United States. The US achieved 4.3% annualised growth over the last quarter. I want to fight tooth and nail with you to get that extra growth. To compete with America. I say this because I know what it would mean for families. The impact it would have on people’s wages. On their disposable income. On their living standards. He is expected to welcome the strong progress the Government has made so far in delivering its Modern Industrial Strategy, with a new quarterly update confirming £79bn of investment commitments and 50,000 well-paid jobs secured in just the last quarter. He will also confirm the names of three new business leaders to join the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council: Amelia Gould (General Manager, Maritime at Helsing), Keith Anderson (CEO, Scottish Power) and Dana Strong (CEO, Sky). He is expected to say that whilst the Government has made important choices for the long term such as on rail, roads and runways, it must be just as bold at driving growth in the short term: That means injecting real urgency into delivering our Modern Industrial Strategy. Taking risks. Placing the big bets on the industries that we know can win. And win big. Kyle will also set out the Government’s approach to regulation, such as accepting the findings of the Fingleton Review on nuclear and moving away from “pointless gold plating” of state projects. To help bring the UK into line with the US’s levels of growth, he will argue that British businesses need help in scaling up to encourage them to stay in Britain. This will include large new investments from the British Business Bank and more firepower for UK Export Finance. He is expected to say: Very soon, I will be setting out how we’ll go even further to reduce that regulatory burden and ensure our most promising start-ups don’t need to leave our shores to reach their full potential. Over the coming days and weeks, we will be doing more – a lot more – to move the dial. To go for growth at every opportunity. He will highlight the Government’s work to reduce burdens for business since his appointment, including a £230 million reduction in admin costs and energy price support such as the Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, slashing businesses’ energy costs. The reception comes ahead of the Business Secretary’s attendance at Davos next week where he will engage with business leaders and set out why the UK is truly the best place in the world to invest, with a culture of entrepreneurship, world-class education and certainty for business. Other attendees at the reception will include the Director Generals of the CBI and BCC, Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy, and executives from Heathrow, Blackrock, McKinsey, BP and AstraZeneca. Keith Anderson has been CEO of ScottishPower since 2018. Prior to his appointment as Chief Executive, Keith was CEO of ScottishPower Renewables and led Iberdrola’s international offshore business. Before joining ScottishPower, Keith worked with some major financial institutions including The Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life, as well as working as a management consultant with E&Y. Keith has an Honorary Degree from Strathclyde University and is an Honorary Fellow of the Energy Institute. Amelia Gould CEng FIET is the General Manager, Maritime for Helsing and leads the Group’s work in the maritime domain. Amelia has over 20 years of strategic and operational delivery experience in the global defence sector. She began her career as a Royal Navy Engineering Officer where she served for 11 years before moving into enterprise architecture and then joining BAE Systems, where she held senior technical and leadership roles. She became Managing Director of Helsing UK in 2023, helping build Europe’s leading defence tech company, and is now General Manager Maritime. A Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the IET, she is committed to inspiring future talent through her STEM ambassador work and as Chair of Trustees for FirstUK. She was also a Non-Exec director at Maritime UK Solent for 5 years, promoting maritime innovation across the region. Dana Strong is Group Chief Executive of Sky, one of Europe’s leading media and entertainment companies and part of Comcast Corporation, a global media and technology group. Dana has managed both cable and satellite businesses around the world and is recognised for her track record for accelerating growth. Before joining Sky, Dana led transformation and growth for many of the world’s largest media and telecommunication companies serving as President of Consumer Services for Comcast Cable, the largest broadband and PayTV operator in the United States; President and Chief Operating Officer of Virgin Media; and Chief Transformation Officer of Liberty Global.

Title: Ethereum stuck between staking strength and derivatives risk – What’s next?

Time Published: 2026-01-13T22:00:58Z

Ethereum’s bid–ask imbalance signals “caution.” Risk assets are stuck in a tug-of-war between supply and demand. Consequently, breaking out of the ongoing market chop requires spotting a bid–ask imbalance. According to AMBCrypto, how top caps navigate this imbalance will likely determine their next directional move. For Ethereum [ETH], early signs are already showing, putting the usual “buy the fear vs. sell the strength” question back into focus. Notably, BitMine seems to have picked a side, staking another $340 million in ETH. Source: ValidatorQueue And it doesn’t stop there: BMNR now has $3.69 billion in total staked ETH. Meanwhile, about 2.16 million ETH are waiting to be staked over the following days, potentially bringing total staked Ethereum to nearly 37.8 million, an all-time high for this period, assuming the exit queue remains at zero. In short, Ethereum’s chop around $3k looks like a textbook breakout scenario, with bids dominating the action. In this context, could ETH be setting up a bear trap, catching the short side off-guard? Liquidity in derivatives is thickening as the market navigates uncertainty. CoinGlass data shows nearly $2.95 billion in short clusters at near-term risk if ETH moves another 11%. Meanwhile, Binance’s 4H perpetual contract is about 70% long, suggesting late-long positions are starting to catch up. Given Ethereum’s solid technicals and staking flows, this positioning makes sense. That said, calling it a full-blown supply squeeze might be a stretch, as around 160k ETH have moved into reserves just this past week. Source: CryptoQuant Moreover, another BlackRock deposit has hit the network. Against this backdrop, analysts note ETH’s Open Interest (OI) is rebounding to early-October levels. A rising OI generally implies more traders are opening positions, setting the stage for sharper moves in either direction. That’s where Ethereum’s bid–ask imbalance comes in. Staking is tightening supply, but sellers haven’t stepped away yet. In short, long exposure is building faster than demand, leaving the bid fragile. Hence, ETH’s chop remains exposed to a bull trap rather than a breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Here’s how the US government now offers a path to a new all-time high for Bitcoin and crypto CLARITY

The CLARITY Act introduces a regulatory framework to harmonize SEC and CFTC oversight, redefining asset classification and safeguarding investor interests. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Jan. 13, the US Senate Banking Committee released the full text of the highly anticipated Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY) ahead of its expected markup this week. The 278-page draft abandons the strategy of picking winners on a token-by-token basis. Instead, it constructs a comprehensive “lane system” that assigns jurisdiction based on the functional lifecycle of a digital asset. Speaking on the legislation, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott said: “[This legislation] gives everyday Americans the protections and certainty they deserve. Investors and innovators can’t wait forever while Washington stands still, and bad actors exploit the system. This legislation puts Main Street first, cracks down on criminals and foreign adversaries, and keeps the future of finance here in the United States.” The proposal arrives at a pivotal moment for the industry. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, described the legislation as the “Punxsutawney Phil of this crypto winter,” noting that if the bill passes and is signed into law, the market could be “heading to new all-time highs.” Notably, crypto bettors on prediction markets appear optimistic, with Polymarket users currently assigning the CLARITY Act an 80% chance of being signed into law this year. However, the clock is ticking, as Senators have a tight 48-hour window to propose amendments to the text. The core of the draft creates a legislative bridge between the two primary US market regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Joint effort by SEC and CFTC signals end of policy uncertainty, aligning with U.S. crypto innovation goals. The Clarity Act revives and codifies a policy distinction often debated in legal circles: that tokens sold with a promoter’s promise may begin their life looking like securities but can evolve into commodity-like network assets as control disperses. To operationalize this, the bill defines an “ancillary asset.” This category covers network tokens whose value relies on the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts” of an originator or a “related person.” The legislation directs the SEC to specify exactly how to apply those concepts through rulemaking, effectively giving the agency the front-end oversight of crypto projects. Once a token falls into this lane, the draft leans heavily into an SEC-led disclosure regime that mirrors public equity standards. The required disclosure list is extensive and intentionally “public-company-ish.” It mandates that issuers provide financial statements that must be reviewed or audited, depending on the size of the raise. It also requires ownership details, records of related-party transactions, token distributions, code audits, and tokenomics. Additionally, issuers must provide market data such as average prices and highs/lows. However, the bill provides a clear handoff by repeatedly anchoring the definition of a “digital commodity” to the Commodity Exchange Act. It treats the CFTC as the relevant counterpart regulator for the market plumbing, requiring the SEC to notify its sister agency of certain certifications. Put simply, the SEC regulates the “promoter” questions (disclosure, anti-fraud, and fundraising). On the other hand, the CFTC oversees trading venues and intermediaries that handle the assets once they are traded as commodities. This framework also imposes strict investor protection rules on intermediaries themselves. The draft states that Regulation Best Interest applies to broker-dealer recommendations involving digital commodities and that investment advisers’ fiduciary duty extends to advice on these assets. This ensures that even if Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities, the brokers selling them to retail investors do not get a regulatory free pass regarding suitability and conflicts of interest. For market participants holding major assets, the most immediate impact comes from a specific carve-out tied to exchange-traded products (ETPs). The text states that a network token is not an ancillary asset if its unit has been the principal asset of an exchange-traded product listed on a registered national securities exchange as of January 1, 2026. This provision serves as a functional on-ramp to commodity status, bypassing years of litigation and SEC debate over decentralization. In practice, this “ETF gatekeeping” clause captures Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their established footprint. This means that digital assets like XRP, Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, Dogecoin, and Chainlink that have achieved this status would be treated the same as BTC and ETH. Beyond asset classification, the draft offers significant relief for the Ethereum ecosystem regarding staking. The draft addresses the lingering fear that staking rewards could be classified as securities income by defining them as “gratuitous distributions.” The bill explicitly includes multiple staking pathways in this definition, covering self-staking, self-custodial staking with a third party, and even liquid staking structures. This is particularly noteworthy, given that the SEC previously filed legal actions against firms like Kraken for their staking activity. The firm will pay a large penalty and face a permanent injunction. Crucially, the text establishes a presumption that a gratuitous distribution is not, by itself, an offer or sale of a security. The language regarding “self-custodial with a third party” is precise, noting that it applies where the third-party operator does not maintain custody or control of the staked token. This creates a tailored safe lane for non-custodial and liquid staking designs, though it leaves custodial exchange staking open to continued regulatory scrutiny. The legislation also incorporates the “stablecoin rewards fight” directly into the market-structure package. They earn $176B on Fed reserves and $187B in swipe fees, and now they’re lobbying to shut the rewards door. Section 404 of the Clarity Act appears to hand the banking sector a victory regarding yield-bearing instruments. The latest text prohibits companies from paying interest or yield solely for holding a payment stablecoin. However, legal experts note a critical distinction in how the bill constructs the yield economy. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys, noted that CLARITY deliberately allows stablecoins to be used to earn yield, but it draws a bright legal line between “the stablecoin” and “the yield product.” The bill adopts the definition of a “payment stablecoin” from the GENIUS Act, requiring such coins to be fully backed, redeemable at par, and used for settlement, without giving holders any entitlement to interest or profits from the issuer. This ensures that a token like USDC cannot pay yield just for holding it, which would classify it as an illegal security or shadow banking product. Yet, Title IV includes a section on “preserving rewards for stablecoin holders.” This allows users to earn yield by utilizing stablecoins in other systems, such as DeFi lending protocols, on-chain money markets, or custodial interest accounts. PayPal's PYUSD trading volume spikes following its integration with major Solana DeFi protocols. Under this framework, the stablecoin remains a payment instrument, while the “wrapper” or the yield-generating product becomes the regulated financial entity (whether as a security, commodity pool, or banking product). This architecture effectively prevents regulators from classifying a stablecoin as a security simply because it can be used to earn interest. Thus, it preserves the viability of the DeFi yield economy atop “boring” payment tokens. The new draft also addresses the contentious issue of decentralized finance (DeFi) interfaces. Hughes pointed out that the bill moves away from a simplistic “wallets vs. websites” debate and instead establishes a “control test” to determine regulatory obligations. According to the text, a web interface is legally treated as mere software (and thus not subject to broker-dealer registration) if it does not hold user funds, control private keys, or have the authority to block or reorder transactions. This creates a statutory safe harbor for non-custodial platforms like Uniswap, 1inch, and MetaMask’s swap UI. It classifies them as software publishers rather than financial intermediaries. Conversely, the bill strictly regulates any operator that possesses control. If a website can move funds without a user signature, batch trades, or route orders through proprietary liquidity, it is classified as a broker or exchange. This captures centralized entities like Coinbase and Binance, as well as custodial bridges and CeFi yield platforms. The proposed Senate bill seeks to impose KYC on DeFi, sparking fears of an exodus to offshore liquidity platforms. Despite the optimism from some quarters, the bill’s release has triggered a “mad scramble” among legal experts to identify critical flaws before the 48-hour amendment window closes. Jake Chervinsky, the Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, pointed out that lobbyists and policy experts are racing to address what he described as “many” critical issues before the markup deadline. According to him: “A lot has changed since the draft that came out in September, and the devil is in the details. Amendments are due by 5 pm ET, so it's a mad scramble today identifying critical issues to fix in markup. Sadly there are many.” Meanwhile, some critics also argue that the bill introduces existential threats to privacy and decentralization. Aaron Day, an independent Senate candidate, described the mandatory trade surveillance requirements as taking a page from the “NSA playbook.” Day highlighted provisions for “universal registration” that would require exchanges, brokers, and even “associated persons” to register, effectively burying the concept of anonymous participation. He also pointed to mandates for “government custodians,” arguing that self-custody for regulated activity effectively becomes illegal. He said: “BlackRock and Wall Street get clear on-ramps while DeFi gets strangled in the crib. The SEC and CFTC get expanded empires and fresh revenue streams. You get watched. Tracked. Controlled.” Beyond privacy concerns, reports indicate the industry faces two specific policy hurdles in the latest draft. Crypto journalist Sander Lutz reported that the language around stablecoin yield has left both banks and crypto advocates dissatisfied. While banks appear to have secured a ban on interest for holding stablecoins, loopholes regarding “activity rewards” and loyalty programs remain murky. Lutz also noted that the Senate Banking Committee's addition of an “unexpected section on DeFi caught industry lobbyists off guard. According to him, the section's new definitions could rope decentralized protocols into strict regulatory frameworks. CLARITY Act vote ahead As the Senate Banking Committee moves toward the Clarity Act markup, the political landscape remains fluid. While the bill cleared the House last year, the inclusion of banking-sector priorities, such as restrictions on self-hosted wallets or prohibitions on CBDCs, remains a point of interest for negotiators. With the Senate substitute text now effectively resetting the terms of engagement, the industry is watching to see if this bill will finally signal an early spring for US crypto regulation. However, Lutz noted that the current frictions have led to a darkening outlook among some insiders. He reported that an unnamed industry source described the bill's current chances as “NGMI” (not gonna make it). According to him, the source cited not only structural disagreements but also enduring conflicts between Senate Democrats and the White House regarding ethics and conflict-of-interest language. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Wall Street's increased Bitcoin ETF shares in Q4 2025 highlight strategic buying during price slides, hinting at a more complex market play. While investors pour billions into ETFs, options dealers are mechanically selling into every rally, creating an artificial ceiling that suppresses true price discovery. Collateral mobility is the pitch, yet delivery-versus-payment depends on an on-chain cash leg that isn’t fully ready. While Adams pledged to fight antisemitism, on-chain sleuths found nearly a million dollars missing from the liquidity pool after a questionable "round trip" transaction. WLFI’s move to become a "narrow bank" reveals the hidden mechanism that will soon gatekeep crypto wealth. US banks call the Clarity Act an "extinction-level event" to protect a specific $360 billion revenue monopoly. Marking its first burn of 2026, BNB Chain's latest event eliminates over $1 billion worth of tokens, showcasing a strategic step in managing supply.

Title: Gold tops $4.6K as crypto enters macro week: Coincidence or early warning?

Rates spike, liquidity shifts: Is crypto at risk? The crypto market is heading into another macro-heavy week. This time, however, the main headwind is “rate cuts.” From the recent fallout between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell to tariff-related FUD and the upcoming CPI report, all roads lead back to rate expectations. The logic is simple: as Q1 unfolds, traders are pricing in rate cuts as a bullish catalyst for crypto, and with roughly $200 billion in inflows over the past two weeks, liquidity is stacking up for a potential risk-on rotation. Source: X However, smart money clearly splits on the outlook. On one side, $1.2 trillion BlackRock is calling for a 3% Fed rate cut. On the flip side, JPMorgan, the world’s largest bank, is hawkish, projecting no rate cuts “this year,” with other big players like Barclays backing that view. In fact, even Willy Woo has flagged a bearish outlook for crypto in 2026. Naturally, with volatility ramping up, Bitcoin [BTC] faces a test of its “safe-haven” status. The big question: Have traders already priced in this setup? Traditional assets are back in the spotlight, hitting fresh highs. Gold (XAU), for instance, topped $4,630 on the 12th of January, syncing with the growing macro FUD around crypto. According to AMBCrypto, the big question is, is this just a “coincidence” or an early warning for risk assets? Looking at 2025, this rotation doesn’t feel random. Gold closed the year with a 65% ROI, while BTC lagged at -6%. The result? The Bitcoin/Gold ratio has slipped to 20, meaning it now takes 20 ounces of gold to match one Bitcoin, down from 35 ounces at the start of the year. Source: LongTermTrends In essence, crypto FUD gave gold a boost in the 2025 cycle. Notably, the same pattern is playing out now. Gold and Silver are breaking into all-time highs “together.” Looking back at 2025, this kind of rotational move always lined up with stress building under the U.S. economy. Now, that’s where rate cuts come into play. With recent macro FUD flipping the market hawkish, the odds of a cut sit at just 5%. In this climate, the upcoming macro week is primed to put crypto under pressure, with Gold’s breakout acting as an “early” warning sign.

Title: Trump set to lead largest-ever US delegation to World Economic Forum in Davos next week

Time Published: 2026-01-13T17:26:56Z

GENEVA (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump will return to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting of business, political and cultural elites in Davos, Switzerland, next week, leading a record-large U.S. delegation, organizers said Tuesday. The Geneva-based think tank says Trump, whose assertive foreign policy on issues as diverse as Venezuela and Greenland in recent months has stirred concerns among U.S. friends and foes alike, will be accompanied by five Cabinet secretaries and other top officials for the event running from Monday through Jan. 23. A total of 850 CEOs and chairs of the world’s top companies will be among the 3,000 participants from 130 countries expected in the Alpine resort this year, the forum says. Forum President Borge Brende says six of the Group of Seven leaders — including Trump — will attend, as well as presidents Volodymyr Zelenskky of Ukraine, Ahmad al-Sharaa of Syria and others. A total of 64 heads of state or government are expected so far — also a record — though that number could increase before the start of the event, he said. China’s delegation will be headed by Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing’s top trade official, Brende said. Among the scores of other high-profile attendees expected are European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as well as tech industry titans Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Brende said the U.S. delegation will include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff. The forum, which held its first annual meeting in 1971, has long been a hub of dialogue, debate and deal-making. Trump has already attended twice while president, and was beamed in by video last year just days after being inaugurated for his second term. Critics call it a venue for the world’s elites to hobnob and do business that sometimes comes at the expense of workers, the impoverished or people on the margins of society. The forum counters that its stated goal is “improving the state of the world” and insists many advocacy groups, academics and cultural leaders have an important role too. This year’s edition will be the first annual meeting not headed by forum founder Klaus Schwab, who resigned last year. He’s been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of New York-based investment management company BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings.

Pirates, Plunderers & Predators… The US criminal terrorist organization and its banks, mega-corporations, and secret drug enforcement units are now openly stealing property and presidents and running terror-style operations while the social propagandists roll out fake videos of people who ‘own nothing but are happy’. I am Jeff Berwick and this is my 3D Game Video. In this video game, I’ve been dodging weaponized Cat 5 hurricanes and giant earthquake boulders to get the truth out there about an insane, deranged psychopath system that is trying to kill and enslave everyone on earth. For my trouble, I got a WARNING that said “You’ve offended Mossad”. As I talk about the past week’s clown show, Banana republic, cheap ass propaganda and lies, I’m battling “truth” salesmen Alex Jones, Tim Pool, Nick Fuentes who are full-on shilling for the Slave System and its government bodies and elite institutions. In this game, I’m tracking the Venezuela takeover – ruthless, bloodless and not in the least suspicious. BlackRock gets bitcoin. JP Morgan gets silver. Benjamin Mileikowsky gets to hand-pick a new anti-Iran, pro-Israhell regime. And, Trump gets Mar-A-Venezuela. Next up: Colombia and Cuba (both of which have some pretty great riviera estate for Trump Towers and golf courses). And, Greenland. Because national defense and so on, you know. Of course, if you were really going to round up the world’s worst dictators and druglords, the Clintons, the Bushes, the Obamas, the Bidens and Trumps would all be on death row, along with Anthony Fraudci, Kill Gates, Albert Bourla and the rest. In my video game, Berwick.exe (status Stateless Dog Walker) has only one curse, given by the Oracle of Early Sight: “You will see the trap before it springs, but most won’t believe your crazy tales before it’s too late.” Am I crazy? Or do I know these things because I’m not registered in the System and I can see through the Mirror projection? I swore no oath and wear no crown. I carry no sword… but a pouch full of silver coins… And a bag of ITOADASO’s.

Title: Trump criminal probe of Fed Chair Powell marks unprecedented escalation — and a warning to his successor

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank had been served by the Justice Department in connection with allegations related to congressional testimony on the renovation of the bank’s headquarters. (Credit: Federal Reserve) President Donald Trump's criminal probe targeting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell marks an extraordinary escalation in his battle with the central bank, sending a clear warning to the next Fed chair about the risks of defying the White House. Powell confirmed the Department of Justice investigation on Sunday evening in a video statement, calling the move "unprecedented" and another example of what he described as the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to intimidate the central bank. Powell's decision to respond so publicly, after days of private consultation with advisers, marked a sharp departure from the central banker's typically measured approach. TRUMP VS THE FEDERAL RESERVE: HOW THE CLASH REACHED UNCHARTED TERRITORY U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed the Trump administration's criminal investigation in a video statement. (Al Drago/AFP/Getty Images) The probe focuses on whether Powell was truthful during congressional testimony about the project to overhaul the Fed's two main buildings on the National Mall. No charges have been filed, and Powell has denied any wrongdoing. The White House referred questions to the Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said Monday that her office proceeded with the probe after failing to receive a response from Powell, prompting prosecutors to initiate a legal process. "The United States Attorney’s Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman’s congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat," Pirro stated. "The word "indictment" has come out of Mr. Powell’s mouth, no one else’s. None of this would have happened if they had just responded to our outreach." Powell, widely viewed as one of the most crisis-tested Federal Reserve chairs in modern U.S. history, built his career as a lawyer and investment banker in New York before entering public service in the administration of President George H.W. Bush. He joined the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors in 2012 and was tapped to lead the central bank in 2017. Now, a criminal investigation may represent the biggest test of Powell’s leadership, unfolding as Trump weighs his choice for the next Fed chair with Powell’s term set to expire in May. President Donald Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to tour the ongoing renovation. (Official White House photo by Daniel Torok) The next Fed chair would take on one of the most powerful economic jobs in the country, helping decide how expensive it is to borrow money for things like homes, cars and credit cards. Those decisions directly affect the cost of everyday living for Americans. FROM MORTGAGES TO CAR LOANS: HOW AFFORDABILITY RISES AND FALLS WITH THE FED Trump has narrowed his shortlist to four candidates as he approaches a final decision on leadership at the Fed: Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller and Rick Rieder. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been a loyal supporter of Trump's economic agenda. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Kevin Hassett is Trump’s top economic advisor and a loyal defender of the administration’s policies. He currently serves as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, and held two senior roles during Trump’s first term and advised the president on economic policy during the 2024 campaign. POWELL REVEALS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STEP DOWN FROM THE FED AS PRESSURE MOUNTS Meanwhile, Kevin Warsh, a former Morgan Stanley banker, has emerged as a vocal critic of current Fed leadership, sharpening his attacks as he positioned himself as a potential replacement for Powell. He became the youngest person to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2006. Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, was long considered for Treasury Secretary before Trump ultimately tapped Scott Bessent. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller has repeatedly called for rate cuts, a move that aligns, in part, with Trump's demands. Of the candidates, he is considered the veteran academic of the group. He has also reiterated the importance of maintaining an independent Federal Reserve. And BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder is the last candidate to have an interview with Trump before the president makes his decision. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who did pre-interviews with all the candidates, said Trump is expected to announce his decision by the end of January.

As the investigation unfolds and a decision on the next Fed chair approaches, the episode underscores the growing political pressure surrounding a role long viewed as insulated from the White House.

Title: BlackRock to slash hundreds of jobs — latest Wall Street biz to kick off 2026 with firings

BlackRock is reportedly slashing hundreds of jobs across the company, making it the latest Wall Street giant to start the New Year with sweeping layoffs. The world’s largest asset manager plans to cut 250 jobs, or roughly 1% of its global headcount, across its investment and sales teams, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It’s unclear when the layoffs may take place or what is the driving force behind them, though rival banks and asset managers have linked job cuts at their own businesses to restructuring, cost-cutting, artificial intelligence and economic uncertainty. CitiGroup is set to axe about 1,000 jobs this week and UBS Group AG is planning a round of layoffs this month, with another round later this year, according to Bloomberg. A BlackRock spokesperson cast the company’s layoffs as a bid to become more efficient. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg. “Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future.” Shares in the asset management firm – which recorded roughly $13.5 trillion in assets at the end of September – fell roughly 1% Tuesday. BlackRock declined to comment to The Post. The company, which has about 24,600 employees, led two rounds of layoffs last year, each time slashing roughly 1% of its workforce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been looking to lead the company deeper into alternative investments. The firm closed a $12 billion acquisition of alternative credit manager HPS Investment Partners in July. Since then, it has been integrating new executives and readying a new range of funds for investors. In its 2026 investment outlook, BlackRock said it will focus on investment themes such as artificial intelligence, income and diversification. “The first is really what are the biggest growth opportunities in the market today,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s head of equity exchange-traded funds, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” last week. “Where you have to get laser focused to try and find some of these targeted exposures, like artificial intelligence, that could do very well in this environment.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The firm still sees artificial intelligence as a long-term, capital intensive investment cycle, and doesn’t believe it’s dying down anytime soon, Jacobs said. BlackRock is one of the few companies that offers specialized AI-focused funds, like its Tech Active ETF that has amassed more than $8 billion in assets. Income is another major focus this year because BlackRock expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates again, a move that would pressure yields on cash investments, Jacobs said. Diversification is the third focus in BlackRock’s annual report because investors are looking for new assets. “Where can you really get diversification for your portfolio?” he told CNBC. “Something that’s going to behave differently from stocks and bonds.” The company is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Title: Franklin Templeton retrofits money market funds for tokenized stablecoin market

Time Published: 2026-01-13T14:00:00Z

Franklin Templeton is amending institutional money market funds to support stablecoin reserves and onchain cash use without launching new crypto-native products. Cointelegraph in your social feed Franklin Templeton has amended two Western Asset institutional money market funds (MMFs) to plug directly into the emerging US stablecoin regime and tokenized cash infrastructure rather than launching new crypto native products. According to a release shared with Cointelegraph, Franklin Templeton is adapting the two long‑running Western Asset institutional funds so they can be used more directly in US GENIUS‑aligned stablecoin reserve structures and blockchain‑enabled distribution channels, without changing their status as Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered 2a‑7 MMFs. The changes are designed to allow the funds to serve as regulated, government-backed collateral for payment stablecoins and other tokenized cash uses without altering their core regulatory status. ​Franklin Templeton’s Western Asset Institutional Treasury Obligations Fund (LUIXX) invests exclusively in short‑term US government obligations and is structured to be compatible with GENIUS Act reserve requirements, positioning it as plug‑and‑play infrastructure for payment stablecoin treasuries and bank‑style issuers that need SEC‑registered, government‑only collateral. Its Western Asset Institutional Treasury Reserves Fund (DIGXX), on the other hand, has added a blockchain‑enabled “Digital Institutional” share class on top of its existing 2a‑7 structure, intended to make it usable as 24/7, onchain collateral and cash management for tokenization platforms, custodians and broker‑dealers that want digital rails without moving into an unregistered vehicle. Related: XRP jumps 8% as Franklin Templeton, Grayscale ETFs begin trading Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton, told Cointelegraph that the company expects stablecoin reserves to be managed “in both tokenized and more traditional form,” and sees room for both exclusive and multi‑manager mandates as more financial institutions launch their own tokens. He said that several “significant products in the stablecoin market” are “backed by traditional high-quality short-term issuance through non-digitally native product structures,” including the recently launched FRNT stablecoin in the State of Wyoming, and the company sees opportunities to help such partners through its investment management expertise. Franklin Templeton’s role, he said, is to manage reserves “in the product model [clients] prefer,” whether via bespoke portfolios or open‑end mutual funds. Bayston cast the amendments as incremental rather than experimental, noting that Western Asset’s institutional Treasury fund only needed “relatively minor adjustments” to sit inside the GENIUS framework and complement Franklin Templeton’s existing onchain products. In his view, many large clients still want familiar, SEC‑registered 2a‑7 wrappers as they plug into onchain distribution and collateral systems, so the company is extending a digital stack across a broader liquidity “suite” instead of forcing migration to new vehicles. Related: Franklin Templeton expands Benji tokenization platform to Canton Network ​Rather than tying the new digital share class to a single collateral or tokenization platform, Franklin Templeton plans to support access through multiple “trusted partners” as banks, broker‑dealers and other intermediaries roll out their own blockchain‑enabled frontends. Franklin Templeton is not alone in repositioning money funds for stablecoin reserves under the GENIUS Act. BlackRock announced plans to modify a Treasury money market fund in October 2025, aimed at serving as an authorized reserve asset for US stablecoin issuers, tightening its investment mandate to short‑dated Treasurys and overnight repo (short‑term, secured funding), to align with the new federal framework. BlackRock was already managing a bespoke government MMF for Circle’s USDC reserves, as large asset managers increasingly see regulated cash funds as backend rails for tokenized dollars rather than purely retail cash products.

I sit down with Ben Hunt, he writes Epsilon Theory, but he is also the president and co-founder of Persuent. What a fascinating analytic story they’ve put together. They essentially take feeds of everything that’s published around the world, whether it’s in English or Chinese or Russian. They create these large language models and use artificial intelligence to identify rising narratives. In other words, they’re looking for the things that will become storylines, but haven’t quite hit that yet.

Ben Hunt: You know, it’s interesting, Barry. So I, academia was always a, I’ll call it a, a way station for me. It ended up being Barry Ritholtz: A 10 year way station? Ben Hunt: 10 years plus grad school. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a little more than a way station. I Ben Hunt: A little more than a waste station. But I bet this will be familiar for a lot of your listeners. I always had an entrepreneurial bug. You know, I started my first company when I was in grad school, started another one when I was, when I was a professor. And as I know, you know, a lot of your listeners, viewers know, it is, it is a bug. It’s not a feature. Barry Ritholtz: Yes, for sure. Ben Hunt: You can’t help yourself. And academia is not the place to be an aca, Barry Ritholtz: So let me ask you a question about that. Ben Hunt: An academia for sure. So I know why I’ve started a series of companies. I can’t work for other people. Why, why did you have that bug? What, what motivated you to say, I gotta get this out into the world? Barry Ritholtz: I love playing games and solving problems. I have a similar issue about working for other people, which fortunately, academia solves that to a large degree. I mean, you, you are working on your own stuff. You follow your own intellectual bliss in a way that I’ve really never rediscovered. The the problem with academia, of course, is, you know, it’s very, very low stakes. That’s why the academic fights are so vicious, because Ben Hunt: There’s nothing at stake. Right, right. And, and that that is actually true. That’s actually true. And, and so you learn survival techniques and that kind of jungle where nothing is really at stake, at least monetarily, because the, the goal of any sort of academia conference or presentation, like, is to appear smart. Right? It’s not to actually be smart. You’re not actually listening to a presentation to listen to it. What you learn to do is you’re listening to the presentation the whole time. You’re trying to calculate your head. What’s the most devastating question I can ask? 00:04:07 [Speaker Changed] So you’re gonna rock this guy back on his heels with a devastating, a 00:04:11 [Speaker Changed] Devastating question. And boy, that gets old after a while, Barry, I gotta tell you. Yeah. It, it really does. I, I loved the teaching. I loved the, the research. ’cause like I say, nobody tells you what to work on, but the, the church of academia, the, the actual institution of academia, a it’s for the birds, even back when I was doing it. Right. And I think it’s gotten significantly worse. 00:04:40 [Speaker Changed] I can imagine. I can imagine what’s happening with that. So, but the question that this leads me to is, yeah, you’ve had all these jobs within the world of finance. How did your background in academia shape how you view investing? Risk management allocation? 00:04:57 [Speaker Changed] Barry, starting from academia and then getting into our business of investing, I think it was the best thing that could have happened for me for when I got into it, which was kind of later in life, right? Same, same. You know, after I left academia finally to start a software company. And it, after we sold that software company Yeah. A, a a buddy of mine that I think this happens a lot. A buddy of, you know, you have a buddy who’s in the 00:05:29 [Speaker Changed] Business, Hey, you seem to be pretty smart. How would you like to apply this to 00:05:32 [Speaker Changed] This? We’re always, we’re always talking about company X or technology Y why don’t, you know, why don’t you come in? Let’s, let’s give this a try. So that was my path, if you want to call it a path. And what really sold me on it was that markets, it’s the biggest game in the world 00:05:52 [Speaker Changed] For sure. 00:05:54 [Speaker Changed] And like I say, I’m a game player. I love games 00:05:57 [Speaker Changed] And a game theorist. Let’s, let’s, let’s work down that. 00:06:00 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I don’t like to talk about that because, you know, because the, 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] The real game theorists get angry. 00:06:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well, yes. And, and, and I, I understand I am a real one because that was, that was my field for a while. And it’s a real field and it’s a real thing. But it’s been so trivialized when some talking head will come on. Well, let’s look at the game theory of this. Right? And you just want to just, you know, right. Shoot yourself when somebody does this. 00:06:25 [Speaker Changed] So, so the other part of your research, the other part of your academic focus was on narrative theory. And so let’s talk about how did that focus develop? And, and we will talk a little later about what you do today at Persuent with the narrative machine. But what, and 00:06:46 [Speaker Changed] Believe it or not, believe it or not, it all ties together. I, 00:06:48 [Speaker Changed] I doesn’t don’t doubt that for a second. And, 00:06:50 [Speaker Changed] And it’s 00:06:51 [Speaker Changed] What initially led you down that rabbit hole. 00:06:54 [Speaker Changed] When we think about kind of who’s been an influence on you in your, in your life, had a very influential undergrad professor in political science. And then I had a very influential graduate advisor. Again, they don’t call it political science in, up at, up at Harvard. They call it government or something. Right? Something like that. But, but it’s political science. And, and the reason I say they were influential is that they really got me focused on the science side of political science 00:07:30 And that science side. Yes. It’s kind of some of the typical terrible stuff you see in all social sciences, like economics, where, you know, you’ve gotta learn how to deal with structured data. Right. And, and there was, there was a lot to learn. And I, it’s, it’s worth talking about because I see the same mistakes being made over and over again by people in our business who want to try to, well, you know, apply math to data and, and there are some real pitfalls and some, some real intellectual capital I think that you can achieve within academia that you can then bring in and apply to the, the, the investment world. What, 00:08:20 [Speaker Changed] What we’ve certainly seen amongst the quants, a very successful application of math theory to data. The, in fact, some of the best performing hedge funds are quantitatively driven. That’s not where you’re going. 00:08:37 [Speaker Changed] Well, it’s, it’s part of where I’m going. Right? So, so there, there, there’s a transition in all of all of the sciences, honestly, but certainly the, the social sciences where, where, yes, you start with numbers, structured numbers, right. Price over time, you know, things you can calculate and measure as those numbers. But what was clear immediately in politics, and I think has become increasingly clear in the world of investing, is that it’s not just the numbers that you get on your Bloomberg terminal, it’s also the words and the stories and the narratives that are told to us. Politicians have known this forever, right? So the story of politics is the story of people suggesting laws or policies and then having to present it in a way that gets them elected or keeps them in power or whatever that is. So there’s always been a focus, I’ll say more of a focus in political science than in economics with words. Economics is almost seen as a, as a sideline. Right? It, it’s somehow lesser than the numbers. Right. So what, what I was kind of early on was applying the same techniques that we have for understanding, you know, matrices and structured data, but applying it to unstructured data, which, you know, full circle, this is at the heart of all of the generative AI and the, the AI that we have today. 00:10:28 [Speaker Changed] Well, you’re, you’re getting way ahead of me now with generative ai. We’ll circle back to that. Yeah. But, but 00:10:32 [Speaker Changed] It’s all the, the math has not changed. Right. In 35 years since I started working with network math around unstructured data. I mean, we, we didn’t call it natural language processing back then, and we didn’t call it, you know, large language modeling, but that’s exactly what we were doing. 00:10:53 [Speaker Changed] So what was, what was the moment or the catalyst for you to say, Hey, I’m working in all these other areas, but the narratives continue to pop up over and over again on all sorts of different data sets. And I think in the financial markets, I can use a, a novel approach to identifying narratives and anticipate where the market’s going. What, what led to that sort of in insight, 00:11:25 [Speaker Changed] Not the, not the Great Recession, right? But the aftermath, 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] Meaning the 2010s following the great financial crisis, 00:11:34 [Speaker Changed] Starting in, in, in 2009, and the recovery that we had out of 2009, and in particular when Win Ben Berke and the Federal Reserve move towards a very explicit effort to use their words to impact markets. 00:11:53 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about that. ’cause I have some really specific memories of the low, of the, the runup afterwards, all the noise Yeah. That was going on. Some of the phrases that have come out of that era, like financial repression and other such things are, are just the tip of the narrative iceberg. So, so walk us through your insight. It’s 2009. Yep. The market bottoms really kind of a v bottom and took off from that. What was that, March 9th, March 7th, something like that. Yep. Oh nine. And there was no turning back. What were you seeing? How were you integrating that into a concept of let’s identify narratives in order to anticipate market moves? Well, 00:12:47 [Speaker Changed] So I was co-founded a, a long short fund inside of a, a larger asset manager going back in oh five and oh 5, 0 6, 0 7. We did well, like everyone else did. Well. And then in oh eight we did great. 00:13:08 [Speaker Changed] Really? In oh eight, we did great. Oh eight, I think I wanna say s and p down 37% something. Yeah. We 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] Were up 20 something net. 00:13:14 [Speaker Changed] Anything in the green, not in the red is 00:13:16 [Speaker Changed] Smith. Yeah. Amazing. And, and now I’ll tell you, and we can come back to this, like, the real question you should ask is that given what we believed, why wasn’t, why weren’t we up 40%? That, that’s actually, that, that’s actually a question you can ask. But 00:13:33 [Speaker Changed] I I’m, I’m gonna say a 47% relative price swing. I, I, I’ll take, 00:13:39 [Speaker Changed] Had a, had a, had a great year in oh eight and, and 00:13:42 [Speaker Changed] Did that continue in oh nine 00:13:45 [Speaker Changed] Flatlined. 00:13:46 [Speaker Changed] Alright. 00:13:47 [Speaker Changed] From oh nine, so from March of oh nine. So we did well in January 1st quarter, February and the first quarter, right. The rest from, from March of oh nine, our returns flatlined. So we never, we never lost money for our clients in our fund. But 00:14:01 [Speaker Changed] You didn’t catch that recovery. That 00:14:03 [Speaker Changed] V did not catch the recovery. Absolutely did not. And the, the recovery was interesting, right? You’re, you’re right. There was a v but there were, there were starts and stops to it. So the, the big move up from the bottom in late March going into April, it’s like, all right, that actually we caught a little bit of that and that that made sense, right? There was a second leg to the rally. Oh, for sure. April, may. And then in June, in June, June to October was a ferocious rally. 00:14:39 [Speaker Changed] Ferocious is the right word, but, 00:14:40 [Speaker Changed] But June in particular was a classic crap rally. 00:14:45 [Speaker Changed] Right. Meaning it was a low 00:14:46 [Speaker Changed] Quality, right. Low quality stuff. Right. The, the end of March going into April rally, it was Right. This makes sense, right? We bottomed fed the June rally. No, no, it was, we didn’t, we didn’t touch any Oh, 00:15:03 [Speaker Changed] That’s a, that’s fascinating. Go back, 00:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Go back and look at it. Right? I, and, and let me tell 00:15:07 [Speaker Changed] You, oh, I don’t, just so you know. Yeah. I, I have a vivid recollection of chatting with Jim Bianco about this, and we were both bullish, but for completely different reasons. To me, anytime US equity markets are cut in half, I’m a buyer and people say 1929, I’m like, great, you gotta go back a century to find the exception that proves the rule. But Jim was early on in the Tina trade, Hey, the Fed has made everything cash, trash bonds are, they’re forcing you into equities, which is what led my post, which everybody stole the line. This is the most hated bull market in history. Yeah, yeah. And I, I wrote that up. I send that out and I heard everybody borrow that. But I’m curious as to where the June rally took you. Well, 00:15:55 [Speaker Changed] This, and this is where I’m going about the role of forward guidance in Jim Bianco’s point about, because what the Fed did wasn’t just it’s policies around interest rates, you know, they took them to zero. And that’s where we stayed, 00:16:16 [Speaker Changed] Started buying mortgage backs and they did 00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] Qe, balance, balance sheet operations. Right, right. 00:16:22 [Speaker Changed] Quantitative easing, 00:16:23 [Speaker Changed] Actual, you know, actually, and I look, I, I think QE one, I think it saved the world. This 00:16:28 [Speaker Changed] Is what, right. And what was that? A trillion dollars something crazy. 00:16:31 [Speaker Changed] Something. Yeah, something something. 00:16:32 [Speaker Changed] 800 billion, something 00:16:33 [Speaker Changed] Something like 800 billion 00:16:34 [Speaker Changed] Unthinkable number. 00:16:35 [Speaker Changed] So I, I think that, so those were specific actions took, but, but even if you, people often say things when they’re leaving office. So, so Bernanke’s last speech is valedictory address. 00:16:48 [Speaker Changed] Right. More honest than intended. 00:16:51 [Speaker Changed] Much more so, and you see this all the time, right? George Washington leaving office. 00:16:55 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say, I, 00:16:55 [Speaker Changed] I, I, Eisenhower Yeah. 00:16:57 [Speaker Changed] That’s a big, 00:16:57 [Speaker Changed] I mean, when, when, when, when freaking Eisenhower warns you against the defense industrial complex. You know, you might, you might. I’m just saying. No, I won’t listen. 00:17:06 [Speaker Changed] It’s general like to you. That’s 00:17:08 [Speaker Changed] Right. General, like to me, what Bernanke said when he is leaving his terms of office, he said, look, we had, we had two toolkits. One was traditional stuff, interest rates down to zero. At the time we didn’t know we could have negative interest rates. So, you know, that’s where we were. Right. Second were the balance sheet operations, large scale asset purchases, qe, quantitative easing. It said, you know, QE one was great. Did what we hoped it would do. QE two, eh, operation Twist, QE three, this is Bernanke saying, mind you. Yep. He says, I actually think that might have been a little counterproductive, 00:17:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh? 00:17:49 [Speaker Changed] They said, but we had another toolkit, and that was our communication policy. That was forward guidance, that we started using our words not to communicate to the market what we actually felt. We started using our words and coordinating our words to change the market, to change market behavior. This is what I mean about making a conscious effort to tell a story. And it, it’s not that it was necessarily lying, but they, they were using their words and choosing their words for effect 00:18:28 [Speaker Changed] To shape perception of their underlying 00:18:31 [Speaker Changed] Behavior to market, to, to shape market behavior. And he said, that worked better than we had any hope that it could. And that’s where we are now. 00:18:42 [Speaker Changed] So, so for the youngins listening, I have to point out, and you and I are old enough to remember back in the days where there were no minutes released there, there wasn’t an announcement, forget a press conference. You had to be watching the bond market to figure out what the Fed just did. Like today, there’s, we’re holding the, having this conversation. There was a fed the October meeting, a quarter point rate, cut a conversation about all sorts of stuff. I really didn’t pay a lot of attention to it. Yeah. Lack of clarity, no data, blah, blah, blah. 00:19:20 [Speaker Changed] Worse than that, Greenspan would be intentionally vague and obtuse. 00:19:25 [Speaker Changed] If you understood with you’re saying what I said then, then you misunders you misinterpreted it. Right? Exactly. 00:19:30 [Speaker Changed] Right. 00:19:30 [Speaker Changed] If you think you understand what I’m saying, 00:19:33 [Speaker Changed] You know, who led the committee to make all that change? Janet Yellen, she was vice chair. Yep. 00:19:39 [Speaker Changed] Back, back in, during the financial crisis. Yeah. 00:19:41 [Speaker Changed] So this was, it was a concerted effort. Bernanke Yellen to this is when they also started going, putting all the Fed Governors on a common calendar. 00:19:52 [Speaker Changed] Right? 00:19:53 [Speaker Changed] Follow all the, and assigning the fact, okay, you’re gonna speak this day, you’re gonna speak that day. That’s when all this started. It was an intentional effort. And again, this is something that politicians have known forever, right? Politicians craft the message and use their words. So I, I knew the, the tools to try to understand this, but what I wasn’t prepared for was how, and neither was Bernanke, was how powerful this would become to the point where today it’s not just central bankers using their words as their main policy toolkit, but it’s every CEO it’s every CEO Now, I mean, you go on this network or one of the other networks, and what makes for a good CEO is can you tell the story? Can you tell the narrative of your company to get a multiple, right? Because, because a multiple is a narrative. A multiple is a story. 00:20:52 [Speaker Changed] They’re 00:20:52 [Speaker Changed] All stories. Well look at, 00:20:53 [Speaker Changed] Look at some of the most successful CEOs throughout history. I would throw Jack Welch into that pile. ’cause he was a fabulous, fabulous. Yeah, he was a fabulous, fabulous. ’cause the stories he told were great, right? Up until the point where we found out that he was running a, a, a hedge fund with GE Capital, and they magically always beat by a penny. 00:21:17 [Speaker Changed] So I remember vividly when GE was coming to our shop, what they wanted was a fin a financial multiple, right? So they were making, they, they wanted, 00:21:33 [Speaker Changed] Even though they’re an old world industrial, 00:21:35 [Speaker Changed] Even though they’re an industrial, this, that this was, they wanted to tell a story that they should be seen as and get the multiple of a financial, that’s what GE was all about in those years leading up to the, the, the GFC. So a, my, my poster child for this is, is Mark Benioff Salesforce, because he’s pri you often see this with people who come out of sales like, like Mark did, right? But 00:22:08 [Speaker Changed] The way it’s all about storytelling. 00:22:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s all about storytelling. And 00:22:13 [Speaker Changed] What isn’t that true for go through the great, see, look, Steve Jobs, Reed Hastings, Larry Ellison at Oracle to some degree, Steve Ballmer at Microsoft, who wasn’t a great CEO, but he was a great cheerleader story, and a great storyteller, great 00:22:32 [Speaker Changed] Storyteller. What all of those companies have in common is that they’re great storytellers, and those are trillion dollar companies today. Right. What I would say to you is that you don’t remember or hear about the companies that did not have CEOs who are great storytellers. 00:22:51 [Speaker Changed] Well, Ken Lay was a great storyteller until you found out that it was all nonsense. And you could say the same thing about folks like Bernie Madoff. 00:23:00 [Speaker Changed] There are a lot of stories that get told that are not true. Right? What, and and I think even today, people think of this word narrative. They have a pejorative sense to it. It’s like, 00:23:15 [Speaker Changed] Oh, really? Really? That’s interesting. I didn’t think of it that 00:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Way. Oh, for, for, for, for for sure. That’s just your narrative, man. You know, the Big Lebowski, you know, that’s, that’s the, and it’s not that a story is a lie. It’s that the story is constructed for effect. It’s, it’s not, and it’s presented to you as if this is my true and inner thoughts, but the construction of the, the intentionality behind these stories, phenomenal. Benioff, for example, you know, created the metrics by which he wanted Salesforce to be judged. Not metrics of profitability, but metrics of what he called proforma, net revenue growth, whatever the hell that means. Right? Right. And because if you can construct the story, you can construct it in a way that, yes, I can beat and raise pretty much every quarter. So there was, there were three, I think, big changes that happened to make the role of narrative overwhelming as it is today. Whereas before, it’s always been there. To your point, it’s always been there today, it’s overwhelming. And, and I think it’s, it’s not just the success that first central bankers and then CEOs. I mean, wall Street’s the greatest copying machine. We Wall Street copies what works. Sure. So when you see that something’s working, oh, they’re, they’re getting a multiple by telling the story and going on Kramer, you know, four times a 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] Year. It’s endless. It’s endless iteration. You’re just constantly tweaking it, doing works. And if it works, do more of it. And if it doesn’t, toss it out. So 00:24:58 [Speaker Changed] It was the, the fact that it works to tell a story and people got good at telling stories. It’s the growth of 24 7. I’m gonna use air quotes here and I’m glad we’re taping this news. Well, 00:25:11 [Speaker Changed] It’s media, social media news right 00:25:13 [Speaker Changed] Now. 00:25:14 [Speaker Changed] News, like news light. 00:25:16 [Speaker Changed] That wasn’t the case. 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna I wanna annotate what you said slightly. Okay. Because I think CEOs have always been storytellers, but they were storytellers to their boards, to their employees, to their shareholders. Correct. They always, the, you’re hitting now on the modern world of 24 7. Media telling a story in a boardroom is very different than sitting in a TV studio and talking about, Hey, here’s why our new chip is gonna catch up to Nvidia. Yep. And it’s the greatest thing ever. Yep. That’s a different skillset. It 00:25:52 [Speaker Changed] It changes the time horizon. It is a very different skillset because you’re not telling the story of, oh, I’m getting another, you know, turn of leverage in our operations, or, you know, our capacity utilization in this factory went up by 5%. Which are the kind of stories you would tell even on earnings call or certainly to a board. Now, this is the story where got a 00:26:16 [Speaker Changed] Gotta gotta 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] A little bit. You, you’re, you’ve got a segment, you’re going on, Kramer, you got four you minutes and say bye bye bye. You got at most four minutes. Right? Right. How are you gonna tell that story that sings to that audience? Enormous change, change, structural change in our media, both quote unquote news media, but also financial news media. The Wall Street Journal today is a 24 7 news, financial news organization. Right. 00:26:47 [Speaker Changed] What, what isn’t It’s printed New York Times, Bloomberg, the Washington Post. Exactly. They all have websites that get updated around the clock. 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] And here’s the thing, there’s not enough hard news to fill the time or to fill the space. So what takes the space opinion 00:27:04 [Speaker Changed] Story you were channeling 00:27:05 [Speaker Changed] Story takes the place of 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] The hard, you were channeling Michael Creon from 25 years ago. Most of what you see in the media is speculation, opinion, and theory, not news. I, 00:27:18 [Speaker Changed] I’ve written so much about Creighton and his 00:27:21 [Speaker Changed] I know. That’s why I threw that back to 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] You. He says he, he was, he was so far ahead 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] This quarter century ahead of what, of what took place. 00:27:28 [Speaker Changed] And there’s a third piece though, 00:27:31 [Speaker Changed] Give us the third piece before we go to our next segment. Third 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Piece has changed. Everything is our smartphones 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] That you walking around with. Right? Not only a studio, but a, a a a, a dopamine device that you’re constantly playing. 00:27:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s my dopamine machine, right. And I, we do it to ourselves. It’s not that someone forces us to hear these stories over and over again. We do it to ourselves. I mean, I get a little nervous if I, you know, pat, where’s my phone? Where’s my phone? That’s right. That’s right. I, I get a little nervous. And it’s a, it’s, it is absolutely a neurotransmitter addiction. I think it’s so important to keep that from our kids. That’s a whole nother thing. 00:28:17 [Speaker Changed] There’s a whole depression situation with teenagers today, and it all traces back to the phone and social media. 00:28:22 [Speaker Changed] These are three, I think, real secular changes we’ve had. Markets become this political utility, the success of constructing a story, structural changes in social media, and the devices that we insist on caring with our ourselves all the time, 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Absolutely Fascinating. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Ben Hunt, president and co-founder of Perent, explaining how he’s using AI to identify narratives in real time. I’m Barry Ltz. You’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My special guest this week is Ben Hunt. He is a academic fund manager, risk manager, entrepreneur, tech startup person. He is currently co-founder and president at persent, which applies AI tools to map and measure market narratives in real time. It’s really more than market mar narratives. It’s politics, it’s economics, it’s markets. You cover a whole lot of stuff. A 00:29:51 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. So what we’re able to do today, and this is the crazy change in the world back from when I was doing this on microfiche back in 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] The 00:30:02 [Speaker Changed] 1980s. Yeah, exactly. We get, we have access to everything that’s published publicly in the world. And there are a couple of big data aggregators, Dow Jones, one LexiNexis another, everything that gets published in the world, all these languages, it’s available to you. And it’s, it’s not cheap, but it’s not crazy expensive like it used to be. And it’s always getting cheaper. So we’re able to take everything in the world that gets published, all the newspapers, all the websites, all the transcripts, everything that’s published publicly, we can pull in and then we can process it, process it with really, it’s the same math that I was using 30 years ago. Nobody’s invented cold fusion here, 00:30:55 [Speaker Changed] But the software tools are faster, stronger, better, 00:30:59 [Speaker Changed] And infinite. So the, the, the calculations here are not particularly complicated, but you have to do them at enormous scale. 00:31:08 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s a ton of volume. So, 00:31:10 [Speaker Changed] I mean, it’s crazy. The, the, just the, the scale of 00:31:15 [Speaker Changed] The numbers. Petabytes, terabytes just crazy. 00:31:17 [Speaker Changed] I mean, yeah. In the last couple of months we’ve processed over 200 billion tokens. Billion, 00:31:25 [Speaker Changed] Right. And a token is how much 00:31:26 [Speaker Changed] A, a token is like a word or a phrase. Okay. And so that’s the kind of the unit that you talk about when you’re putting through, when you’re putting something through a linguistic calculator. So 200, which is, which is what all of the, the 00:31:41 [Speaker Changed] LLMs, 00:31:41 [Speaker Changed] All the LLMs are, they’re linguistic calculators. And so, you know, we’ve processed, you know, several hundred billion tokens. Again, it’s not complex, but it is at scale. And what, what we’re doing with that is we’re reading the world’s news to understand the world’s stories and narratives. And you’re right, it’s, it’s much bigger than, or it’s much more focused that we have much higher resolution than just saying, oh, I’m bullish on financials. I mean, that’s a, that’s a narrative. Sure. Right. 00:32:20 [Speaker Changed] But 00:32:21 [Speaker Changed] There are 20 different variations of that. You’re, you’re bullish on financials. Why? 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] So wait, let me, let me, you, 00:32:28 [Speaker Changed] And we can track all those, we can track all those stories and how they wax and wane over time. That’s really cool. So 00:32:32 [Speaker Changed] Let, really cool me roll back to, I want you to explain what Perent is. Who are the clients? I don’t mean names, but No, sorry. What type of of clients do you have and, and what do they do with Persian’s output? 00:32:47 [Speaker Changed] So we started Persent in 2018. My partner from, we were at a, a asset manager spun out there to take the, the technology that I’ve been working on for years and, and really been writing about with Epsilon theory. So we started that in 2018 to do the, the basic research into processing enormous amounts of financial news data and to track the stories and how they rise and fall and wax and wane over time. Is that, that was, that was the story. That was the 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] Goal. So I, I love that description because there are a lot of trades going on where the storyline changes on a regular basis. Probably the Mac daddy of that is crypto first. It’s, Hey, you know, there’s fiat currency, this is outside of the system, it’s defi, then it’s a hedge for deflation, then it’s a hedge for inflation. Now it’s scarcity and, 00:33:51 [Speaker Changed] And digital gold. Right? Digital 00:33:53 [Speaker Changed] Gold. 00:33:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s, there are no fundamentals, right? With, with, with crypto. And I people will say there are, but there aren’t. Right? It’s, it’s driven by the waxing and waning of stories. And do, do they find purchase? Do they or do they kind of, people get tired of them? 00:34:11 [Speaker Changed] Well, they got tired of the defi story. And then once JP Morgan and BlackRock started creating, like, the Ibit is the fastest ETF to a hundred billion dollars. And so the old story of Defi is gone. And the new story is, oh no, this is an asset class at Wall Street’s embracing. That’s why you have to own it. 00:34:32 [Speaker Changed] That story, that story was, and very, that was a very similar story by the way, or a transition story from physical gold to GLD when that ETF came out. Right. Which was a very similar pattern because once it became a Wall Street, a, a table at the Wall Street Casino, right? Then it takes on a different meaning specifically around gold. Gold changed from being, okay, something that you bury in your backyard or you’re having your vault, you know, along with ammo and seeds for when the, the, the hard times come 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Bottled water, right? Bottled meals ready to eat, right, gold and lead. It 00:35:15 [Speaker Changed] Becomes a security. And its meaning changes from that, you know, apocalyptic bottled water. Right? And the meaning of gold today is as an insurance policy, a security against central bank error or government error. That’s the meaning of gold today. 00:35:35 [Speaker Changed] And is that the dominant narrative that you’re identifying as gold rallied over through 4,000? Ab 00:35:41 [Speaker Changed] Ab Absolutely. So, I mean, we’ve really been able to track that one in 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Specifically. So, so here’s the really big, here’s the million dollar or trillion dollar question. How do you identify a narrative and say, oh, gold is gonna double from here based on this narrative? Or, or are we not there yet? 00:36:00 [Speaker Changed] No, you, you identify the narratives. ’cause the narrative, the stories don’t ever change, right? So the, the story that leave gold aside for a while, think about you we’re talking about your bullish on company X, Y, Z because there are about, I don’t know, depending on how, again, how finely you want to resolve that. There are only about a dozen stories for why you’re bullish on something, right? They can be management change, top line growth, opportunity consolidation in the industry, 00:36:35 [Speaker Changed] Upcoming catalyst, 00:36:36 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so every catalyst story, new 00:36:38 [Speaker Changed] Products, new product, FDA’s gonna prove the new mo, new drug, new molecule. 00:36:43 [Speaker Changed] So that story, you just change the name. That’s the same story that’s repeated over and over again about any pharma or, or, or biotech company. The stories, we think that they’re amorphous and variable. The fact is that the, the core of the story, what we call the semantic signature, the meaning of a story, they’re amazingly constant over time. So what we’re looking for is for, and it’s, it could be dormant for a long time, but what you want to know is when that story starts picking up again, when someone starts playing that story, when it appears on Kramer and starts happening in the financial press, that’s the stuff we can pick up with real precision. So it’s both the stories that are starting to fade, 00:37:41 [Speaker Changed] But, 00:37:42 [Speaker Changed] But the, I think the really interesting stories are the stories that have been dormant for a long time and they start picking up again, 00:37:48 [Speaker Changed] You, you are reminding me of Campbell’s hero’s journey, that there’s only so many 00:37:54 [Speaker Changed] My hero, right? There are only so many stories Right. In the, in, in the world. And that, that’s a now I like to talk about in Hollywood, famously there are only like five scripts. 00:38:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. Right? 00:38:10 [Speaker Changed] Tolstoy is supposedly Tolstoy. He said there were only two stories that a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. Those are the only two stories in the world. And 00:38:20 [Speaker Changed] Not quite, but he’s, he’s 00:38:21 [Speaker Changed] Not quite but you on, he’s pretty close. You’re on the right track. 00:38:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? Right. The 00:38:24 [Speaker Changed] The point is, there’s a finite number of stories, right? You can drill down. So you can get a couple of dozen about any sector you want to talk about or like, but it’s, it’s a finite number. And so what we do, and what I think is really interesting is to track that finite number of stories. And you’re right, it’s not just around markets. We track several thousand of these stories today. 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] How so? Let’s, let’s delve into that. Yeah. So, so how do you, you have this massive database you’re sucking in every news feed. Yep. Everything magazine, newspaper, everything. Anything that you could quantify and, and run into a linguistics model. What’s the process for analyzing this? How to use artificial intelligence to, to go through this, and how do you make sense out of that heap of how do you find signal amidst all that noise? 00:39:23 [Speaker Changed] The crucial thing is you can’t just ask AI an open-ended question. Say, what are the narratives in Right? This comp for this company or for this sector? Don’t do that. Right? And this is a mistake that people make all the time. They ask open-ended questions of chat, GPT or or or whoever. The problem is chat, GPT will give you an answer. 00:39:45 [Speaker Changed] Just not a good one. 00:39:47 [Speaker Changed] Not a good one. It’ll hallucinate a lot. Yeah. Right. It’ll go out, it’ll find its own data. The, the secret to to using AI successfully is to take this magic genie because it’s a magic genie and you stuff it into that bottle, right? You do not let it out. You constrain it dramatically. You don’t let it go out and find data. You give it the data crucial thing. You don’t allow it to think. You tell it how to think. So the, the most important step that we do is we don’t ask ai what are the narratives that you look at? We tell it this is human direction. You have to have human control. 00:40:31 [Speaker Changed] So I’m hearing dataset is controlled by you as well as the thinking prompts. The seman. 00:40:39 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And it’s more than prompt, right? So the, it it, it includes prompt. But the, the phrase that’s used in this world is called not prompt engineering, but context engineering. 00:40:53 [Speaker Changed] Okay. That makes sense. 00:40:54 [Speaker Changed] So you want to, you want to control everything around the ai because you want to limit it to being that linguistic calculator. You want it to be your operating system. That’s really the way, the thing. And, and if you do that, then it will give you the same answer twice for the same inputs and the same question. That’s the crucial thing. So it’s 00:41:18 [Speaker Changed] Consistent 00:41:18 [Speaker Changed] For this to be true for, for it to be consistent, for it to be real signal. So this is a human directed process. You can’t ask AI an open-ended question. You have to control all the inputs. You have to control the output, meaning you judge it, you run it back through a different AI system to say, how’d they do? Did they go off the rails here? But the most important thing is you have to give it the scaffolding. You have to give it the, the skeleton. You have to tell it. These are the thoughts you are allowed to think about. You know what, and those are the, those are the, the signatures. 00:41:53 [Speaker Changed] I, I’ve kind of learned, I have to avoid asking questions that have a, a, a human emotional subtext. Like, tell me what was most surprising about this? Doesn’t know what a surprise is. Tell me what was most interesting about this. It does, it’s not able to do that. You really have to treat it like it’s a dumb machine. 00:42:18 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s right. This is why, I mean, you treat it, you, you need to treat it as an operating system. You need to constrain every bit about it, particularly in how you allow it to think because it wants to please you so badly, right? It does. So if you ask it, what’s interesting, it will look back at its history of communication with you, and it’ll think, what will Barry find interesting? And it will give that answer to you. And if it can’t find it easily, it’ll make it up. It’ll make up an answer that you will find interesting. 00:42:48 [Speaker Changed] I, I find when I, I, I try and prompt, Hey, tell me about Ben Hunt’s background and gimme the timeline of his career that it’s good at. Hey, what was Ben Hunt really good at? It has, has got no idea. 00:43:04 [Speaker Changed] So what, what you’re able to do, if you’re able to, again, put the genie in the bottle, tell it how to think about a problem, is you’re able to identify, and this does go back to the work from 35 years ago, the type of stories we tell that we humans tell the, the about stocks or politics. We tell two types of stories. We tell descriptive stories. Oh, the, you know, the fed cut rates by 25 basis points today. A descriptive story. But, and we can also tell the description of the, you know, 00:43:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s the because clause, because we’re seeing slowing increasing layoffs and slowing consumer terms. 00:43:53 [Speaker Changed] And, and that’s high resolution and dec and, and very descriptive, right? The, the Powell was surprisingly hawkish today. And he was, that’s a description. There’s another type of story we tell Barry. And that’s prescriptive, 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Meaning, 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] Meaning the Fed should be hawkish. The Fed should cut by 25 basis points. Those are the stories that are indicative of an effort being made to move public opinion in a certain direction. 00:44:33 That’s like the forward guidance that the Fed still does, right? Using their words for effect. They’re using words to nudge you and how you should think about the world, how to think about the world. So the crucial thing when we’re doing these, when we’re asking the AI to here’s, here’s all the text in the world, here are the stories that we want you to identify. We can also boil that down into identify the stories that are trying to tell the reader how they should think or how policy should go that we find has a lot of predictive capability to it. 00:45:18 [Speaker Changed] So you are in the business of analyzing the world’s narratives every day. How is that even possible? It seems like that is an impossible 00:45:29 [Speaker Changed] Test. That’s seem crazy. 00:45:30 [Speaker Changed] Crazy, right? 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] And, and, and it used to be, it used to be crazy. I, I mean, Barry, I I really do remember my, in the academic days, I would literally hire grad students and give them a cup of dimes. So they go down to the microfiche machine. 00:45:46 [Speaker Changed] I remember those machines in the library. You 00:45:47 [Speaker Changed] Remember those 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Machines? Yes. 00:45:48 [Speaker Changed] Yes. You remember those machines? I would code, hand code the, or hand record the coded data. I would type it into remote access for a digital equipment mini frame. And the next day, you know, something would churn out for me. Right? Today it’s, I say we are, we’re processing hundreds of billions of tokens. We get millions of documents overnight like that. 00:46:16 [Speaker Changed] Is there there 00:46:17 [Speaker Changed] Any, is there infinite computing resources available to us? I, 00:46:20 [Speaker Changed] Is there anything you can’t access that you wish you had access to any data source? 00:46:28 [Speaker Changed] So one of the things that’s happened on Wall Street is that the banks and the sell side have become very jealous of their publications because they tend to think in their wrong that they’re good at it. Right? They’re that they’re good at analysis. I personally don’t think they are. Well, 00:46:49 [Speaker Changed] Let, let’s just say some are better than others. Some 00:46:52 [Speaker Changed] Are better than others, but, but none of ’em are really, if if they were, if there was, I’ll call it kind of significant alpha there, they wouldn’t be a bank. 00:47:04 [Speaker Changed] They’d be a hedge fund. 00:47:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They wouldn’t be a ba on the, on the sell side. Now, so I’m interested in reading the sell side research, not because I think there’s some nugget of truth in there, but because I wanna see what they’re all talking about, 00:47:17 [Speaker Changed] Right? It’s reflective of, if not a consensus. Yeah. Certainly a a popular set of ideas. 00:47:24 [Speaker Changed] And, and this is a crucial thing to talk about what we do. I I don’t know what the truth is, right? I have 00:47:31 [Speaker Changed] No idea. Does it matter? 00:47:32 [Speaker Changed] And I don’t think it matters. I I want to provide this information to people who do have a view on the truth. Let’s say you’re a, you’re a value investor, right? You’re running a fund, you’ve got your views, you’ve done a, your homework, you’ve done your research, 00:47:47 [Speaker Changed] You’ve got a good back test. Yeah. 00:47:49 [Speaker Changed] You, yeah, yeah. You’ve got, so I’d say I’ve got, here are the companies where I think I’ve identified something special, something that’s valuable that the market does not recognize. And so I wanna buy it, and then I’m just gonna wait. I gotta wait until one day the market realizes the market comes to their senses and says, oh, wow, that should trade at a higher multiple or a higher price. Because that special thing that you saw, that source of value, the rest of the world comes to see that. Well, what I can think I can show you is when the rest of the world starts to wake up to whatever it is you’re looking for. 00:48:31 [Speaker Changed] So you’re catching the early lift off the bottom. That’s the 00:48:35 [Speaker Changed] Goal. I see. When the, when, when a value investment only works, when the market recognizes it. And we are tracking when something like that gets discovered by the market. 00:48:46 [Speaker Changed] So before Nvidia is 5 trillion, when it, when it starts ramping up to 500 billion, hey, something’s going on here. 00:48:57 [Speaker Changed] What I have found in my experience as an investor is that you make the most money on a trade during what I call the discovery phase of a trade. When the rest of the world wakes up to something that you had noticed and identified before, that’s when the money is made. Once it gets out there, 00:49:19 [Speaker Changed] Then it’s reflect then the, the market be ev is eventually efficient. 00:49:23 [Speaker Changed] It’s a different, it is a different risk and reward profile. Let me, let me put it that way. Fair. You, you, you get, you get a lot more ups and downs post that discovery phase than you do when you’re enjoying the discovery phase. It’s a lot harder. Once you have the, now you may say, oh, but there’s gonna be this other catalyst. And then say, well, 00:49:45 [Speaker Changed] But that, that discovery phase is, I’m gonna quote Doug, Cass, that’s the, there’s a phrase he uses it, it’s like a, a contrarian perspective. A variant perspective where a perspective, you have some insight that is not widely held. Right. And the market being mostly kind of sorta of eventually efficient if there’s a truth or at least a good story in your variant perspective, all 00:50:15 [Speaker Changed] It is a story, right? All it takes is a story. It’s 00:50:17 [Speaker Changed] Gotta be a good story though. Yeah. 00:50:19 [Speaker Changed] It’s gotta be a, well, I’ll call it, it’s gotta be a compelling story, right? Right. And that’s, that’s why you are looking for a CEO who can tell that compelling story. You’re looking for the ability to tell a compelling story, because that is what gives you a multiple. So let me multiple is story. 00:50:37 [Speaker Changed] So let me ask you a few more questions on, on Perent before we go into a few other areas. Sure. So first, you, you’ve been doing this for seven years. What are you doing today? That was unimaginable 4, 5, 6, 7 years ago. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] I, I tell you something that was unimaginable really two years ago. That’s amazing. And that is the ai. So what we were doing in our early days, we were basically doing small language models. We were making the language models essentially by hand. And, you know, we did our first models and our first versions of this, and we licensed it to some big banks. And here’s the problem, Barry. We, we had constructed a net and it was a pretty good net. I mean, when we would dip it into a data stream, we’d catch a fish meaning a signal. And the signal, oh, that, that signal works. You know, good, good. Hit on the, the signal that we put up. The problem was we were missing too many damn fish, right? Our, our net was too small. And we’d say, oh, we got this one. And then we’d look back at whatever it was. 00:51:46 We were designing the model. So we say, well, how did we miss all these other fish? And the answer was the small language model we were constructing. It’s incredibly complex if you are building these models without the probabilistic approach that modern LLMs allow you to take, right? So this is the whole notion of embedding. So that there are a million ways to say I’m bullish about the management change at company X, Y, Z. There are a million ways you can say that. And if you’re in the business as we were of kind of handcrafting, let’s write down all the ways you can say that. Oh, really? You miss a lot. Yeah. You’ve made a small net and what you’re trying to, to, to, 00:52:33 [Speaker Changed] And a and a small data set, and it’s 00:52:35 [Speaker Changed] A pretty small data set. So we, we rebuilt all of our software, again, using AI as an operating system context, engineering control, how you dole out the text data, how you test it, how you allow it to think. And we thought, all right, you know what? We’re building a bigger net. I bet we see five, maybe even six x improvement in our signal 00:53:05 [Speaker Changed] Catching. And what did you end up with over 00:53:06 [Speaker Changed] A hundred x? 00:53:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s unbelievable. 00:53:08 [Speaker Changed] Over a hundred x, it’s over. And now it’s, we’ve had a multiple of that. Again, it’s, it’s, it is hard to describe in, in the, in the, the expansion of the net is in so many different directions. Everything we were doing before was just English language, 00:53:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? So now you’re global and how many languages are you pulling into the, 00:53:29 [Speaker Changed] Anything, anything that an AI has been trained on, we read it and we can say we can, 00:53:35 [Speaker Changed] Is that 40 languages? Is that like how many languages? Well, there 00:53:38 [Speaker Changed] Are only a, you know, there are about a dozen languages that are useful in markets. So 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] It’ll be Japanese, Chinese, a variety of European languages. So 00:53:47 [Speaker Changed] We can, we can 00:53:48 [Speaker Changed] Tell Indian, 00:53:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s the, here’s a story here. The story about Chinese domestic markets. There’s a western story, western narrative, 00:53:57 [Speaker Changed] And there’s a domestic Chinese story. And the domestic 00:53:59 [Speaker Changed] Chinese story, 00:54:00 [Speaker Changed] Which is very different. 00:54:01 [Speaker Changed] Often it’s very different. So we were able, for example, picking up, we were able to pick up way before it, it, it got picked up in Western press. The demand for luxury goods in China went off a cliff. 00:54:19 [Speaker Changed] Cliff, yeah. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] In last November. 00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] Listen, you can’t go from a double digit GDP to like, low to mid single digits and not have it affect, especially in a country like that. Well, 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] And, and, but, but it’s interesting, right? Because, because they’ve had, you know, ups and downs on business cycle before, but this is the first time where you saw consumer behavior that really was kind of similar to what you might find in a Western consumer behavior point being you didn’t hear that from LVMH or the Macau gaming guys until February. And we were picking that up in, in, in November from the domestic Chinese media. 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so that raises a, a really interesting question. You know, at the end of the day, clients want to be able to make money on your research. How are people putting this to work? How, how does what you are building help your clients generate alpha? 00:55:15 [Speaker Changed] What we think we’ve discovered is an entirely new source of data. And what we’re confident is that we’ve built the systems that are very different from what you see with this sort of analytics that are out there from anyone else. Right? So this is not sentiment, right? We’re not tracking or using mean words or nice words. By 00:55:37 [Speaker Changed] The way, that was a big thing, I dunno, was that 10 years ago we’re s we’re scanning Twitter to identify investor sentiment. Oh 00:55:44 [Speaker Changed] My god. I mean I, but I was just looking today and not to pick on Bloomberg, but you know, it was their live coverage of the Fed statement, right? Were at those meeting, they were analyzing the sentences and the fed statement for hawkish and dovish sentiment, 00:56:02 [Speaker Changed] How it changed from the last meeting. And, 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] And 00:56:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so so you’re saying there’s not a whole lot of signal there. 00:56:08 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. I wanna be careful with what I say, right? Which is that there are a number of, I’ll call ’em high frequency stat arb guys, where if it’s important for you to note the difference in word choice on a millisecond level, I think there, I think you can get something outta that. I do. And so there are firms that can do that very well. That’s not our game, right? This is not the, what we’re trying to, to identify is not just sentiment, not just word choice. This is not Google trends and how many times did they mention AI in the earnings report, right? There’s, we’re able to track the actual stories that drive behavior. 00:56:54 [Speaker Changed] So that, that’s the next question. And, and I’m gonna give Dave not a credit for asking this. Does every narrative turn into a decision? How do you know when something is merely noisy versus where there’s a, a significant tradable signal? 00:57:14 [Speaker Changed] I don’t. Right. So this is, my goal is not to, oh, you know, do the trades. My goal is Mr. Hedge fund guy, Mr. Asset, allocator, you’ve got a, you know China, right? You know your companies, you know your commodities. Here is data that I think you’ll find useful. The efficacy of it though is up to you. I don’t know what you would, what, what you wanna do with it. I want to sell the picks and shovels honestly for this vast new data set that we all know is important. But we haven’t been able to measure it in a very predictive way before. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about a few things related to that. Can I say one more 00:58:02 [Speaker Changed] Thing? Sure. And it’s not just about using this for investment. So we have a product for financial advisors, right? Which is your clients coming in, you’ve got a portfolio. You need to be able to say, what, what is, what is my client? What, what are they worried about? What are they nervous about? What are they hopeful for? What are the stories they’re reading? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] And you are pulling this out of the flow of media and 00:58:29 [Speaker Changed] We can tell you exactly for of, for the portfolio you’ve got for that client, here’s what they’re gonna be asking about, worried about. And here are the answers you can give them to show this is when has happened before, when this story has come up. Stay the course, it’s gonna be fine. This is the sort of stuff we can do for financial advisors. Huh. 00:58:46 [Speaker Changed] That’s really interesting. I would, I would love to see some of that. It’s not just 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] In markets. Barry, I gotta tell you, the 00:58:53 [Speaker Changed] Policy makers, corporate executives, bankers, 00:58:56 [Speaker Changed] Policy. So we did a, you know, we did before in the run up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we published this on Epsilon Theory. And this is my old academic work, right? The book Getting to War before a country starts a war, they mobilize public opinion, right? And so we were looking at domestic Russian media looking at and saying, friends, this isn’t gonna li be a limited thing. 00:59:22 [Speaker Changed] This is happening. 00:59:23 [Speaker Changed] This is happening. It’s gonna be a full scale invasion. Because that was the messaging in domestic Russian media to the Russian people. 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] Wow. 00:59:32 [Speaker Changed] So brands, right? So you are, you know, we’re working with some, some it sounds, but pro sports teams, you want to tell a story to 00:59:44 [Speaker Changed] Your fan 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] Base, build a stadium, 00:59:46 [Speaker Changed] Sell some tickets to sell some 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Stadium. Yeah. Sell tickets, build a stadium, gimme some examples of people who have told good stories and how did that work for them? How can we do the same thing? So let’s, 00:59:56 [Speaker Changed] Let’s just start looking 00:59:57 [Speaker Changed] At storytelling. 00:59:58 [Speaker Changed] If Jeff Bezos was a subscriber to this back when he was trying to build a tax funded HQ on the Hudson, had he had your data and you were crunching all the New York City news stories about this, might you have been able to give him advice that he 01:00:19 [Speaker Changed] Suffered? A percent 01:00:20 [Speaker Changed] Suffered such a backlash. Because you 01:00:22 [Speaker Changed] Know what we have today? We have polls. Right? Right. Because, 01:00:24 [Speaker Changed] Which are terrible, 01:00:26 [Speaker Changed] Terrible, terrible. Right. Which are mostly terrible now, you know, and, and I love the poly market stuff and other things where you try to get as many people as possible to put money on something. Right? 01:00:34 [Speaker Changed] So, you know, when you ask a person a question, you’re asking them, Hey, what do you think you think? And what do you think you’re gonna do in the future when we know people are terrible at both of those things? 01:00:45 [Speaker Changed] Terrible at both of those things. 01:00:45 [Speaker Changed] But if you put a little money on it, alright, maybe they might be a little more circumspect that, 01:00:50 [Speaker Changed] That, that helped. That helps a ton. So, so in places where you can have a make a bet, I think that improves the kind of information you can get. It still lends itself to a lot of manipulation. Sure. And a lot of, 01:01:02 [Speaker Changed] They’re not issues around it, poly markets and cashie and all those things. It’s not the bond market. It’s not a hundred and something trillion dollars. It’s a couple of bucks on each of these. And sometimes that’s right, a million dollars moves a half a million dollars can move a market. 01:01:17 [Speaker Changed] But for a lot of things, let’s say you’re polling for a political candidate, right? You can’t ask them to put money down on something. Right? Right. You, but, but you really wanna know the, these, these policies that my candidate is thinking about taking on, is that popular? Does it resonate? Is it a compelling story? We can absolutely see if that is true by looking at local media, local social media, all of that. So it’s, it’s pretty wild there. I mean, once you start looking at how important stories are and once you’ve got a tool where you can actually measure them and visualize them, it’s like, it’s like, I feel like it was like when they invented whoever was Lovin Hook or whoever invented the microscope when you’re actually to see something that we all know is there, 01:02:05 [Speaker Changed] Well now we do back then. Right? Like remember germ theory took what a century to catch on it. 01:02:10 [Speaker Changed] It took a century. Yeah. And it takes, it takes seeing it, right? It takes the instrument to actually measure it before you actually believe in it. And so I, I, I feel like that’s kind of where we are right now. It’s these early days. But to actually see and measure the storytelling at this level of resolution, this magnification is pretty freaking cool. 01:02:29 [Speaker Changed] So, so we’re having this conversation with market at all time highs, and you’ve written about the ravine. Yep. Tell us a little bit about what is the ravine, how does, does your data identify that? Tell us what this means. 01:02:46 [Speaker Changed] Well there’s, there’s, there’s clearly been a change in policy regime out of, of Washington and 01:02:53 [Speaker Changed] New administration, and a radically different, 01:02:56 [Speaker Changed] Radically different 01:02:57 [Speaker Changed] Approach, even from the first Trump presidency, 01:02:59 [Speaker Changed] Even from the, the, the first presidency. And so what we’re able to, to measure, really measure is how does that, I’ll say play, but also what comes, narratives never happen in a vacuum. There’s always a counter story. For every bull story, there’s a bear story. And they, they, they, you can almost kind of see the battlefield of ideas, the battlefield of stories and how it emerges. So my strong sense, Barry, is that we are going towards politically in this country towards trench warfare, greater and greater, I’ll call it narrative violence. And it, if you look historically how that plays out in countries, it doesn’t, it doesn’t play out well. 01:03:56 [Speaker Changed] Civil war, domestic political violence, things like that. 01:04:01 [Speaker Changed] Sadly. Yes. Exactly like that. Exactly like that. So there’s that element. And so that’s a, that’s a sad one, you know, or a, a very troubling one and trying to, well, how do we navigate that? But even when in, in markets, and I alluded to this earlier, how capital markets have become a political utility and the, the role of markets in our society, you can really see how that changes in the stories we tell ourselves about the role of markets, what it’s there for. And I 01:04:38 [Speaker Changed] End of day options and speculation, what else is it supposed to be there for? 01:04:43 [Speaker Changed] But that, but that’s kind of what I’m getting at, Gary, right? You, you can see an enormous change in the meaning of markets. And it connects with a, yes, they’ll call it the speculation layer, but it also connects with financial nihilism, yolo, it, it, it leads to a very, I think, less attractive future for how we think about money and the role of markets and the role of capitalism 01:05:20 [Speaker Changed] Coming up. We continue our conversation with Ben Hunts, president and co-founder of persuent, discussing how money managers use their output to generate alpha. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest today is Ben Hunt. He is president and co-founder of Persuent, a data analytics narrative, storytelling, large language model, using artificial intelligence to find some signal amongst the noise firm. Their clients range everything from large money managers to hedge funds to academics and corporate America. So you write Epsilon Theory and some of it is for subscribers. Some of it is public. A lot of 01:06:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s public. Yeah. 01:06:36 [Speaker Changed] One of the things you wrote is absolutely my favorite item from the first few months of the Trump presidency because I like to talk in probabilities. ’cause I don’t know what’s gonna happen. Yep. But here’s the best case scenario. Here’s the worst case. Here’s all the middle scenarios. You wrote a piece, the end of Pax Americana that I thought was the most cogent, imaginative, well thought out. Hey, here’s the worst case scenario, and we are becoming dangerously flirting with this possible outcome. And I use that as all right, so here’s what I think is high probability. Yep. Here’s the best case. But if you really want to think about how this can go off the rails, check out what Ben wrote. And so tell us a little bit about how did Perent inform the end of Pax Americana? Because I, I get the sense that domestically that wasn’t really where a lot, what, how a lot of people were thinking. But I got the sense from overseas that was a much more common thought. Tell, tell us a little bit about both the piece and, and how the data informed it. 01:07:55 [Speaker Changed] I’ll start with the, I’ll call it the, the international dimension. I wanna come back to the domestic dimension because I, I think we’ve got some really interesting data recently to, to, to share. It goes back to this, yeah. Again, I, I cringe what I was talking about, but, but, but it is, it is game theory, right? And all game theory is, is strategic interaction. It’s that the, the United States, yes. Is the most powerful player on the world stage, but every country has some degrees of freedom and some autonomy in their, in the policies that they, that, that they implement this. There is not a dominant strategy, meaning an outcome. An equilibrium outcome. Again, I hate using these words, but I’ll use them anyway. All an equilibrium means is, it’s a balancing point where both parties, let’s call ’em the United States and a European country, where do they end up? Where they all say, okay, I can live with this, where I can live with this and the America first set of policies, and it’s all these set of policies. What you end up with is less potential economic growth, trade, all all of these things, 01:09:12 [Speaker Changed] All the things that we enjoyed post World War ii, that realignment, that imbued to our benefits so greatly, 01:09:20 [Speaker Changed] Enormously to our, to our, to our, to our advantage. Our advantage, yeah. Enormously to our advantage. It, it goes by the name of a soft power and you know, the dollar system, the bread, Bretton wood system, all of this 01:09:30 [Speaker Changed] Reserve currency on and off 01:09:32 [Speaker Changed] The reserve currency to finance our deficit. All of this is enormously to our advantage. And yes, there are free riders on that system. Yes, there are cost to that, particularly on defense and some other, some other areas. Tariffs are in other area where there’s absolutely free riders on that. So there’s improvement that can be made in that system, for sure. Right. But this is not, this is a different system. This is a different set of rules of the road. And it leads to a different strategic interaction between, between countries. So that’s what the note was about. And it’s, it’s, I’m not trying to predict, I’m just, I’m just trying to observe that. And which is a great line actually by George Soros, which is, you know, I’m, I’m not predicting, I’m observing, which I love that as a line I’m not. And our technology is not there to try to predict the future is trying to tell you what is true in the present today. 01:10:30 [Speaker Changed] I, I’m amazed how many people think they can forecast the future when they have no idea what’s happening. Right. I 01:10:36 [Speaker Changed] Wanna, I want to now cast what I want do. That’s exactly, yeah. Not, not forecast. I want to now cast. And that gets the, I wanted to talk about kind of domestic. So we started tracking the different narratives around immigration policy early last year and what you saw in some of the kind of simp 01:10:59 [Speaker Changed] This is during the run up to the election. 01:11:01 [Speaker Changed] Yes, exactly. And what you saw, and really going back, ’cause we can take, we take this stuff back for a decade or more. And what you absolutely saw up to last October, there’s a, there was an event from last October, not the election, but an event from last October. You see a steady increase in, regardless of your political affiliation. You know what immigration isn’t working for us isn’t as, as Americans saw a steady increase starting with the, they’re eating the, the cats. 01:11:37 [Speaker Changed] They’re eating the cats, they’re eating their dogs. They’re 01:11:40 [Speaker Changed] Eating the dogs. When you saw one, the, the Columbus mo when you, that, that moment, 01:11:45 [Speaker Changed] One of the most, that’s where things, the real moments in debate history. 01:11:49 [Speaker Changed] And we see very clearly in our media data, and this is, this is not mainstream media. This is everything that we’re pulling up. We’ve seen an, a really significant decline in the volume and density of, oh my God, immigration is a problem. We need mass deportations. On the contrary, we’ve seen an enormous increase, again, regardless of political affiliation, including Republicans. No, immigration is a good thing for this country. Huh? This is the stories of America that are pro-immigrant and immigration. Now, you would not believe that if you were looking at the policies that the White House has implemented during these first, you know, 10 months of the administration. 01:12:38 [Speaker Changed] So, wait, when did you first notice that? Regardless of policy, we think immigration is a net benefit to America. When did that first start showing up? 01:12:49 [Speaker Changed] It started changing right? In October because it, following 01:12:52 [Speaker Changed] The dogs, 01:12:53 [Speaker Changed] Cats, it was too far. It was, it was like, this is just silly stupid. This is silly and stupid. And it’s been a steady increase. You know? And you wouldn’t, you wouldn’t believe that if you were I immersed in Twitter stuff. But, but, 01:13:06 [Speaker Changed] So this 01:13:07 [Speaker Changed] Is, our country is actually quite pro-immigrant. I know that sounds cr 01:13:13 [Speaker Changed] But we are a nation of immigrants here. Here’s another data point that’s kind of mind blowing. We were talking about a different data point in, in the entirety of the US history, 2025 looks like the first year where the US population will decrease. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it’s a decrease in legal immigrants. Not, not only illegal immigrants, but legal immigrants. Add that with the deportations and just people staying away. 01:13:41 [Speaker Changed] Well, this, this gets back to the, the, the economic picture and from other, so what, what you’ve had is a clear, and again, we, we, we see this in our data from other countries. There’s a clear effort to repatriate assets and funds away from the us. There’s been a clear effort outside the us You see this with central banks, but also with 01:14:03 [Speaker Changed] Cor hence gold. The big and gold. Gold. Correct. 01:14:07 [Speaker Changed] Treasuries used to be a safe haven asset. Right? 01:14:11 [Speaker Changed] No 01:14:11 [Speaker Changed] More. That’s, that’s, it’s, it’s, 01:14:13 [Speaker Changed] Do you understand how significant that charge is? That you’re making, you’re basic, enormous, basically accusing the president, well, of submarining one of the single greatest assets America halts. Well, 01:14:26 [Speaker Changed] That it’s a, it is built up to such a, an extent, right? That the way I think of this is an iceberg that is melting, but it is melting. What we do not see, we do not see capital flight. 01:14:40 [Speaker Changed] Right? We, we saw it for like a week in April, and then that was quickly 01:14:44 [Speaker Changed] Reversed. That was it. So there’s, there, there is, there’s no capital flight there, there are no, 01:14:47 [Speaker Changed] But there was some fear US 01:14:48 [Speaker Changed] Investors that leaving the country that there were fears, and we can track it. If that starts to happen, we’ll see it immediately. That’s not happening. Repatriation continues to happen. 01:15:00 [Speaker Changed] Slowly measured, balanced, 01:15:01 [Speaker Changed] Melting iceberg. Right? Because there are limits to, if you’re a Bermuda reinsurer, I mean, you’re kind of, you’re, you’re stuck with treasuries, right? Right. I mean that, that 01:15:11 [Speaker Changed] You’re, you could buy some gold to offset it, but you can’t sell a hundred billion dollars worth of treasuries. No, you 01:15:16 [Speaker Changed] Can’t. You can’t. So it’s a melting iceberg. But we can clearly see that the dog is not barking yet and maybe never will is capital flight. What we see in politically domestically is that actually, and this was validated by a Gallup poll they’ve been doing 20 years, which also showed what we had saw, started seeing a lot earlier where immigration as a thing is actually pretty darn popular in the United States. 01:15:47 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. But so are, so is restricting assault rifles and we can’t get any change on that. I that’s 75, 80% or the actual 01:15:57 [Speaker Changed] Large. I, I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you that depends very much in how that question is asked. 01:16:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s true for all polling. Well, 01:16:04 [Speaker Changed] This is the benefit of what I’m trying. So, so when, when we’re doing these seman, we call the semantic signatures, it has nothing to do with how you’re phrasing the question. We’re not doing polling. We’re seeing what people are actually the meaning of what they’re talking about in, in media. 01:16:20 [Speaker Changed] So how does that play out if people are legitimately saying no immigration is a good thing for America. Is there an impact on population and the economy? Is there an impact on markets? Is there an impact on policy and politics? 01:16:35 [Speaker Changed] I think there’s an impact on the election, the midterms next year. 01:16:40 [Speaker Changed] So we’re talking, we’re talking literally 12 months from now. 01:16:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. ’cause that’s how this, the stuff gets ca on the political front narratives and opinions. They get cashed out in elections. Right. Mark are different. You, you cash stuff out every day. The right, the market’s 01:16:59 [Speaker Changed] Open every day. The feedback loop is so rapid with markets. 01:17:02 [Speaker Changed] Ex Exactly. Politics is a different story. So Right. It gets cashed out in the elections. 01:17:08 [Speaker Changed] If you were to ask me before this conversation, what’s the most significant impact on the midterm elections? There was just a Gallup poll yesterday, GOP questions on the economy. They were plus 14% two years ago. They’re minus 4% this year. Yeah, I, 01:17:26 [Speaker Changed] I saw that. 01:17:27 [Speaker Changed] And, and that’s an amazing swing. And I’m, I’m saying to myself, you know, listen, the out of power party usually picks up, you know, 10, 15 seats. Yeah. You have the redistricting question, which may blunt that. But if, if the most important question during the election was on the economy, and that’s an 18% swing, this is looking like a pretty substantial shift. What I’m hearing from you is, hey, this isn’t just about the economy. 01:17:55 [Speaker Changed] It’s not, 01:17:56 [Speaker Changed] It’s not what, so it’s the economy, it’s immigration. What else? What else are you seeing? That’s interesting. That’s 01:18:01 [Speaker Changed] It. That’s, that’s pretty. Now there are other aspects though, where the, the stories, it, this is, this is people talking about immigration as a thing. Now, whether, now whether that gets translated into a political party position. ’cause I gotta tell you, the Democratic party I is enormous enough. But there, there are no, there are no narratives that are being put forward by the Democrats that are powerful. Or, or, or, or popular. So I 01:18:31 [Speaker Changed] I I don’t, other than the mayoral contest in New York. Yeah, 01:18:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:18:35 [Speaker Changed] Right. That what I, that’s this 01:18:36 [Speaker Changed] One. What I’m saying is that the, is that the many of the policies that are being presented by this administration are unpopular, not just with the Democrats, but with Republicans. And increasingly so immigration being one of them. I think economy being another one, 01:18:58 [Speaker Changed] Tariffs aren’t really popular amongst, but people perceive that as a tax increase or, or a pressure on small business 01:19:07 [Speaker Changed] Government shut down. Right? So both also not popular. And also in this, it, it’s, it’s that ’cause the, the question, oh, well, the Democrats will get blamed. Well, that’s not really true. That’s not what’s happening now. How that all 01:19:19 [Speaker Changed] Pay, pay and by the out and listeners should know. It is a long way off. You are not a hard, you’re not a Democrat. Oh my 01:19:25 [Speaker Changed] God. No. 01:19:26 [Speaker Changed] Like, like I know you and your politics and the stuff you’re saying, I, I could hear people shrugging and saying, oh, that Ben Hunt is just a liberal Democrat. I’m like, no, no, no. That’s not who Ben is. 01:19:37 [Speaker Changed] No, no, it’s not. 01:19:39 [Speaker Changed] You are just talking about here’s what I see in the data. 01:19:42 [Speaker Changed] I’m saying I’m observing. I don’t, I’m observing. And I think that a lot of times, if we are like me very online and on Twitter too much, right? You, 01:19:53 You don’t see the broader picture of what is happening on blog posts and local newspapers and, and, and everything else. So I think having the ability to read everything and track these stories that, you know, they don’t, they, they, like I say, they wax and wane, but they don’t, they don’t ever go away. The, it’s, it’s, it’s something we’re very excited about to track the stories of America. I’ll, I’ll give you another one. And this one actually, I don’t know what to do with this. One of the stories of America is that America has raised the world’s wealth, right? That, that that 01:20:48 [Speaker Changed] Global standard of living, 01:20:49 [Speaker Changed] Global standard of living, that, that America has been this powerful force to, and, and capitalism and America have been this powerful force to raise people outta poverty. That’s a story that in other periods of time has been out, has been prominently talked 01:21:08 [Speaker Changed] About. Very resonant. 01:21:09 [Speaker Changed] That story is non-existent today. 01:21:11 [Speaker Changed] Well, you cut things like HIVA few million dollars to inoculate all of Africa from HIV. That’s gonna have repercussions. 01:21:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, it, it’s, it’s not just that, that that has the con those those repercussions that you’re describing. Right. What I’m saying is that the story that would support that, it’s gone. 01:21:37 [Speaker Changed] Is it gone forever? Has no, has 01:21:39 [Speaker Changed] No, that’s, these things are never gone. These stories, stories have, they never die. Right? They’re, they’re, they’re waiting for a new force to give them life. 01:21:49 [Speaker Changed] The next version of it, if us is not seen as a force for raising people out of poverty around the world, do people see China as that force? 01:22:00 [Speaker Changed] Haven’t looked at that. We’ve been looking at the, the US store. But I, but I I, my my personal sense is, is that we’ve essentially seeded the field 01:22:09 [Speaker Changed] CEDD with a C not 01:22:10 [Speaker Changed] An S Yeah. With a C. Not in s particularly in South Asia and Africa to, to, to China. I, I mean, that, that seems, that seems pretty, 01:22:20 [Speaker Changed] You know, pretty clear. This is, I’m glad I asked the question about the end of Pax Americana. ’cause I, I, I’ve just found that piece so insightful and so useful, and I could keep you here talking about this stuff for hours. But out of deference and respect for our listeners’ time, I’m gonna jump to our favorite questions that I ask. Oh, sure, sure. All of our cl all of our guests. But before I do, there’s a question that I, I have to pose to you, which is, so you get to see things before they sort of bubble up into the mainstream before they become a well understood narrative. What’s a narrative that you are just starting to sniff out? That most of the world, or most of the country, or most of Wall Street and finance hasn’t seen yet? 01:23:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s a story that people are talking about since tricolor and first brands went out, 01:23:23 [Speaker Changed] Right? The, the, 01:23:24 [Speaker Changed] So it’s the story on, on credit, story of credit, and 01:23:29 [Speaker Changed] I mean, first brands is legitimate. It sounds like felonies were happening there. So we’ll have to see what, how that plays out. I 01:23:37 [Speaker Changed] Probably try color as, as as well. But my point is that every day you have a new bank, CEO come out and say, no, no, everything’s fine. Right? So yesterday it was David Solomon at Goldman Sachs saying, no, no, it’s fine. Today I was hearing the Brookfield guy saying, no, no, it’s fine. For every story, every interview, the guy says it’s fine. You’re getting two articles in the ft or the journal saying ain’t fine. So 01:24:09 [Speaker Changed] The, you think thou death protested too much. Is it that 01:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m, I am I, all I’m saying is I am observing. I’m not predicting, I am observing the level of volume for Hmm. Alternative asset managers, their exposure to private credit. This is problematic. Oh, I’m wondering what’s gonna happen when the music stops. Oh, I think that these, this blows back into the commercial banking system. Those stories, those narratives are higher by an order of magnitude than they’ve been at any point in the last 10 years. Hmm. At any point, including during COVID during when you had similar concerns over, oh my god, private credits. 01:24:51 [Speaker Changed] I was easy to rationalize everything. Hey, listen, we’re all frozen. Just ignore it. 01:24:55 [Speaker Changed] But I, this is a story that has legs. It is growing in a way that I rarely see. And once a story like this grows, it doesn’t just go away. And it’s not fixed by Bernanke saying, oh, subprime is contained. Right. 01:25:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s immediately what I thought of as soon as you 01:25:15 [Speaker Changed] Mentioned it. Absolutely. It does not get fixed by people saying, don’t worry, there’s no problem. 01:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Jim Grant said he was right. It was contained to Earth. Yes. Yes. The rest of the solar system was fine. Which turned out to be a very witty and clever observation. This 01:25:31 [Speaker Changed] Story, this worry, this concern absolutely has legs. And we’re seeing no signs of it easing off in financial media and press. So 01:25:43 [Speaker Changed] The, the big question is, is it systemic? Or I don’t, is it the specific, like 01:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I say, I, I don’t know the truth, right? I don’t know reality. All I can tell you is 01:25:55 [Speaker Changed] We’re seeing more of this. 01:25:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, we’re seeing this is, this is the story. 01:25:59 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Let, let’s jump to our favorite questions, starting with who are your mentors who helped shape your career? 01:26:09 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s good. Well, I, you know, I mentioned that the people both in undergrad and graduate school, who turned to me on to the science part of political science. And in particular in graduate school, Gary King, who runs the whole social science research center up there at Harvard and has for a long time now. He wrote the original, really the book on inference. You hear about inference all the time now. 01:26:34 [Speaker Changed] Well, Cialdini, of course. 01:26:36 [Speaker Changed] So the, the notion of inference taking large data sets and pulling out, 01:26:41 [Speaker Changed] Oh, inference. I thought you said influence. No, no, no, no. Inference. Inference. 01:26:46 [Speaker Changed] So the science of inference, the, I learned that from Gary, you know, 30 years ago. And it’s so interesting to see that come full circle because that’s at the core of, you know, Jensen Wong’s always talking about it and the whole notion of AI to that inference spend. They talk about, I was there at the beginning for how you, what inference is and why it is so powerful. That was a huge influence on me. 01:27:14 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are you reading now? What are some of your favorites? 01:27:19 [Speaker Changed] I’m a science fiction guy. 01:27:21 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I really am. You’re talking to another sci-fi guy. So let’s, so I I I give us something new and something classic. Well, 01:27:27 [Speaker Changed] Something classic would be Lu Hin and the Three Body Problem. Right. 01:27:32 [Speaker Changed] By the way, the Netflix show on that was surprisingly watchable. 01:27:36 [Speaker Changed] I thought it was excellent before that. And you know, I named the company after him was the Foundation Trilogy 01:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Asimov with 01:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Asimov. Those books hold up Less well, honestly. And I thought the, the series was, it had its moments. I 01:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t love the series. Yeah. 01:27:51 [Speaker Changed] It was, it was so pretty soso to me. Current science fiction. Rebecca goes, she goes by RF kwong and she wrote a book called Babel, and she’s got a new one out two B or 01:28:07 [Speaker Changed] One BBAB. 01:28:08 [Speaker Changed] Like Tower of Babel. Right. B-A-B-E-L. And she’s got a new one out Caba I think it is, but science fiction dealing with language and linguistics. I love that stuff. 01:28:19 [Speaker Changed] That, that, I love that stuff. That sounds like that’s right in your, your sweet spot. Let’s talk about streaming. What are you watching or listening today? Podcasts or Netflix or whatever? So, 01:28:29 [Speaker Changed] Honestly, I don’t listen to any podcasts. Isn’t that terrible to admit? 01:28:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, if you host, I will say this. If you host a podcast, you’re either preparing for a podcast Yeah. Doing a podcast or ordering a podcast. Alright. Right. So it’s like, all right. That’s three or four. 01:28:43 [Speaker Changed] That’s all it is. Yeah. 01:28:44 [Speaker Changed] Right. Every now and then I’ll, I’ll catch something. ’cause I wanna either listen to this, a specific guest, like IWI will not listen to any podcasts that you are on before we do our podcast. Right. ’cause I don’t wanna steal anybody else’s Yeah. Or narrative or questions or line of thinking. So I, that’s purposeful. But every now and then, so I listen to, the things I listen to are like John Pirelli’s Radio Deluxe. Yeah, yeah. Which is sort of like a podcast slash music series. Something 01:29:17 [Speaker Changed] A little different. Yeah, exactly Right. What, 01:29:20 [Speaker Changed] What about streaming? What are you watching? Well, 01:29:22 [Speaker Changed] You, you and I are both Big Godfather fans. So we love all the, the mobster. I Have you seen Mob Land yet? With, with No. Alright. Worth your time. Okay. Pierce Brosnan eats up every scene. Tom Hardy is awfully good. I just love him in anything. If you, I don’t know if you ever saw Peaky Blinders, right. Started as a modern 01:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Version of Pinky Blinders. I started, I kind of fall, so couldn’t get into it. So my issue is I have to watch something that my wife tolerates. Like I have, I have friends 01:29:49 [Speaker Changed] That’s a struggle 01:29:50 [Speaker Changed] Who, like, he goes into this room, she goes into that room, they don’t watch anything together. Like, I don’t know how that works. Like it’s, she’ll watch some stuff without me. I will watch some stuff without her. Right. 01:30:02 [Speaker Changed] You gotta have your own space. 01:30:02 [Speaker Changed] But 80% of what we watch, so I have fallen that’s hard down the British upstairs. Downstairs Gilded Age. Yeah. So we watched The Crown, we watched the Gilded Age. We finally, let 01:30:15 [Speaker Changed] Me give you one, lemme lemme 01:30:16 [Speaker Changed] Give you one. We went back to Downton Abbey, which I missed when I first rolled out. 01:30:20 [Speaker Changed] Check out. So my guilty pleasure, and I do watch this with my wife, is a diplomat. 01:30:25 [Speaker Changed] Ju the new series, just the new season just dropped new season. Yeah. And that’s teed up for this weekend. I’m looking forward to that. Excellent. That the first, was this season two or season three? The first season was great. 01:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:30:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I’m gonna give you, if you like that. So my wife finds these really interest. She got me into Killing Eve, which was a little more spy fair than diplomacy. And if you get a chance to watch Slow Horses, oh, 01:30:52 [Speaker Changed] That’s the one I’ve gotta see. Yeah. 01:30:54 [Speaker Changed] It’s really, that’s the one. So the first season is great and people have told me the most recent season, it, it, some people will say, I don’t like the second kinds in the middle. I, I know people who loved it all the way through. But it’s, it’s really, it, it’s really an interesting well told beautiful cast. Just fantastic. Yeah. You’ll, you’ll love that. Our final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give a recent college grad interested in either investing or working with large language models, working with narrative analysis and artificial intelligence? Hmm. 01:31:35 [Speaker Changed] Don’t, and I, I say that tongue in cheek. I I, 01:31:41 [Speaker Changed] You had a lot of fits and starts going back seven, eight years 01:31:44 [Speaker Changed] For, for sure. And I, I tell you what I, I think’s I important you have to, what, what you, what I think you can accomplish in academia, either in grad school or whatever it is, is you build your intellectual capital. And so I think a lot of times when you get out of college, you say, okay, I’m just ready to kind of live my life and start something. And you haven’t built that intellectual capital yet. The the issue is though, is that once you enter, particularly the investment world where particularly if you’re responsible for managing other people’s money, brother, that’s it. Right? I mean, you’re, you’re, there’s, there’s not, you’ve, that’s got to be your, your total focus. You are spending your intellectual capital, you’re not gaining intellectual capital once you take on a role like that. So I, my first advice is find a a path where, and that’s often in, in, in academia where you’re building intellectual capital. Because once you leave that environment, 01:33:02 [Speaker Changed] Then you’re spending it down. 01:33:03 [Speaker Changed] You’re spending it down. 01:33:05 [Speaker Changed] Makes sense. You’re spending it down. Our, our final question. What do you know about the world of, fill in the blank in investing data analytics? Narrative storytelling today would’ve been helpful 25, 30 years ago 01:33:22 [Speaker Changed] In investing. I wish, I wish I had understood the role of, lemme step back a second. I, I think that whether you’re talking about data or whether you’re talking about investing, and I’ll speak for myself, but I think there are a lot of people like me. We think there’s an answer with a capital A right there in the, in the numbers. And if you just look hard enough, and if you work hard enough, you’ll find that answer. Right? You’ll find the secret, the secret formula. 01:34:00 [Speaker Changed] And you have learned since then, 01:34:03 [Speaker Changed] Ain’t no such thing. Right now, there is magic and there are patterns, but it’s, it’s, it’s not in the structured data, it’s not in the numbers, it’s actually in the error. It’s in the probabilities, it’s in, we’re calling, you know, the stochastic element, right? The, the, the role of chance and understanding that there are patterns and there’s real magic in understanding that I didn’t get that when I was either starting with data analysis or with investing. I was looking for the answer with a capital A as opposed to a process with a capital 01:34:43 [Speaker Changed] PII love that answer because, so my exercise in confirmation bias is I love the fact that you looking back, we all have the benefit of hindsight. Yeah. And unfortunately, that can be a bias to certain people. But when you’re looking back at it, you know how it happens at the moment when you don’t know what the outcome is, thinking about it, probabilistically is a much healthier approach than saying, here’s a binary up or down, yes or no. And I’m either right or wrong, and I see people struggle with that constantly, 01:35:21 [Speaker Changed] Constantly. When I first started in the investing world, again late, I got two pieces of good advice, right? One was never go all in. Right? 01:35:31 Which is, which is really interesting because it’s this, this business of investing. It’s a wonderful life. You were solving puzzles, we meet interesting people. We get to have these sort of conversations. It’s a, it’s a career for a lifetime. And the two pieces of advice are really, it never go all in. And also, reputation is absolutely the most important thing. And again, especially when you’re young, you think, oh, well that’s not the most important thing. You know, being right’s the most important thing. It ain’t, it’s playing the long game here, which you want to, it’s never go all in. And the reput reputation 01:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Is never go all in by never go in. You mean never put everything at risk so that if it doesn’t work out, you’re, you’re outta the game. You’re done, you’re out. 01:36:25 [Speaker Changed] Stay in the 01:36:25 [Speaker Changed] Game was the Gerald Loeb’s book, the Battle for Investment Survival? Stay 01:36:29 [Speaker Changed] In the Game, avoid that risk of ruin You, you, you just, or don’t ever risk ruin. 01:36:36 [Speaker Changed] That makes sense, right? 01:36:37 [Speaker Changed] Because once 01:36:37 [Speaker Changed] You, people don’t think in those terms, but that’s really, they don’t, they don’t all in means risk of ruin. 01:36:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s the risk of ruin. And it also connects with reputation because once you, 01:36:50 [Speaker Changed] Once you blow up, it’s tough to go back 01:36:53 [Speaker Changed] And you start saying, oh, I can fix it by taking this shortcut or doing this other thing. Right? And once you do that never ends Well, it never ends well. Right? And you tell yourself, oh, just this one time. It’s never this one time, 01:37:07 [Speaker Changed] Ben, this has been absolutely delightful. I’m so glad we’ve finally me too gone around to doing this. I, I I’m just entranced by your thought process. Some of the things like, I love reading stuff of yours that I totally disagree with. And then ’cause it forces me to say, well, he’s not just making this up. I know how you, your brain works. And it’s like, all right, if Ben is saying this, then I’m gonna make this my worst case than I’m, ’cause it’s easy to dismiss it. Everybody gets out seeking, confirming information and rather than being dismissive of it, alright, you claim to think probabilistically, where does this fit into the range of probabilities? And once you start thinking in those terms, it’s like, oh. So the worst case scenario is worse than my worst case scenario. I gotta move the bottom of my range down further. ’cause if this goes off the rails, this is really bad. That’s what your Pax Americana piece did with me. Well, thank you. And it really, it really helped me figure out how to think about, especially in that week between April 2nd and ninth, where everyone was losing their mind. It’s like, oh no. So they’re losing their mind. ’cause hey, this could happen. But maybe something good comes out of it. Trying 01:38:26 [Speaker Changed] To avoid tunnel vision. I think it’s so important in our business or any business, but especially our 01:38:31 [Speaker Changed] Business. In our business in particular. Well, thank you for being so generous with your time.

Title: Acronis launches Archival Storage to give MSPs long-term, compliant data retention
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/13/acronis-launches-archival-storage-give-msps-long-term-compliant-data-retention/

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 13 2026 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Archival Storage, a data storage and protection solution designed for managed service providers and their small to medium-sized business customers. Pitched as offering long-term, compliant and cost-efficient data storage and protection, Acronis Archival Storage allows users to retain large amounts of data securely, affordably and with fast accessibility when it matters most. Acronis Archival Storage has been built for compliance-driven and data-heavy environments and allows users to store infrequently accessed data with Amazon Web Services Inc. S3-compatible object storage, integrated directly into Acronis’ unified billing and management system. The company says the solution offers the reliability, durability and predictable pricing model MSPs need to meet customer demands and long-term retention requirements. “For many customers, regulations and industry best practices require data to be retained for years,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “With Acronis Archival Storage, MSPs can now provide their clients with long-term storage built for compliance readiness, cost predictability and ease of use.” Key features and benefits include S3-compatible object storage integrated with Acronis’ unified billing and management system to allow MSPs to manage archival data alongside other services from a single platform. The service delivers millisecond-level data retrieval with 11×9 durability and 99.5% availability, complemented with built-in encryption and write-once, read-many immutability that helps ensure data integrity and support regulatory compliance. The offering is designed to provide predictable total cost of ownership, with no egress or application programming interface fees to eliminate unexpected cloud charges and to complement existing warm backup storage in regulated environments. Acronis Archival Storage also emphasizes ease of deployment and ongoing management through preconfigured plans, S3 API support and integrated controls and is supported by seven globally distributed data centers to improve connectivity and meet regional compliance requirements. For MSPs, Acronis says, the new solution represents a new way to differentiate their offerings and build predictable margins through integrated billing and zero egress costs. By combining archival capabilities with Acronis’ robust cyber protection ecosystem, it says, service providers can deliver end-to-end data management that scales across customer needs, now with a cold storage tier. Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Davos to begin new era with global order shaken by Trump
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0113/1552872-davos-begins-new-era-with-global-order-shaken-by-trump/
Time Published: 2026-01-13T12:56:44Z
Full Content:
Business and political elites head to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week with its vision of a rules-based global economic order being tested to the limits. US President Donald Trump's expected appearance in the Swiss mountain resort highlights the gap between his agenda and the consensus-driven approach of the WEF, which has faced enduring criticism that it is a talking shop of the rich. His "America First" policy has led to trade tariffs being used as punishment, military intervention in Venezuela, the threat of taking over Greenland by force and a US retreat from cooperation on climate, health and other global challenges. The Trump administration has also threatened Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell with a criminal indictment, prompting many top central bankers to issue a statement defending him and central bank independence. Dubbing its 56th edition "A Spirit of Dialogue", the WEF's leaders say that given the current uncertainty, getting together to map out a way forward in business and politics is crucial. "Dialogue is not a luxury, it is a necessity," said WEF president and CEO Borge Brende, a former Norwegian minister. But others say that with the US and China leveraging power to suit national interests, the WEF risks obsolescence. "Who is going to be making the case for the rules-based international order?" said Daniel Woker, a former Swiss ambassador and foreign relations expert. "To be very blunt, in a system where everyone is only looking out for themselves, it has no reason to exist. It's an event from the past." Davos-watchers are also looking at whether the event has lost impetus since its 87-year-old founder Klaus Schwab stepped down as chair in April. The Geneva-based organisation said in August an internal investigation had found no evidence of material wrongdoing by Schwab, after a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. It named BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs. The latest forum has much to discuss, from how to handle Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine establishing US supremacy in the Western hemisphere, to the ways artificial intelligence is changing the world. It comes just after one of Switzerland's worst modern tragedies, a ski resort bar fire that killed 40 people. In pre-event briefings, the WEF has put a brave face on the global tumult, highlighting how companies have sought to adapt to the highest U.S. tariff rates since the Great Depression and pointing to an easing of trade tensions in late 2025. Still, a WEF survey of executives released last week showed that doing business got harder in 2025. The poll also painted a downbeat picture of cooperation on peace and security. With several European leaders expected to attend, eyes will be on how they respond to US challenges, including Trump's threats to take over Greenland, and attacks on European efforts to regulate American tech firms. "The politicians need to stand strong," said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of the UNI Global Union representing 20 million service-sector workers worldwide, urging policymakers to address how AI and new technologies impact jobs. One feature of this year's WEF meeting will be top oil executives eager to hear Trump promoting his energy dominance agenda, which encourages them to drill for more oil and gas while snubbing alternatives like wind and solar. The CEOs of Exxon Mobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor and ENI are all expected after much more sporadic attendance in past years, when oil players saw the forum as anti-fossil fuel. It remains to be seen whether China, which in recent years has sent top officials, will field a sizeable Davos presence. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026.

LAST UPDATE | 13 Jan IRISH DIPLOMATS HAVE postponed an accreditation ceremony for the new Iranian ambassador to Ireland in response to the deaths of pro-democracy protestors. Iran has an embassy in Blackrock in Dublin and its new chief diplomat, Eshagh Al Habib, was due to go to Áras an Uachtaráin for a ceremony to accept his credentials. This has been postponed, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, in response to the deaths and injuries of people killed in protests and the shutting down of the internet and phones in the country by the regime. Speaking to reporters in Egypt today during a tour of the Middle East, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee said she didn’t think “it was appropriate” for the ceremony to proceed today. “We’re appalled and I’m appalled by what’s happening in Iran, and I don’t think it was appropriate for that to proceed today,” she said. “We need to keep diplomatic ties open, and we will, but I think it was the right thing to do today.” Iran has been gripped by pro-democracy protests in recent weeks – hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in the uprising against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s rule. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights said it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher. The protests in Iran began in late December over the ailing economy and have transformed into the most significant challenge to the regime for several years. McEntee said today there is a small Irish team on the ground in Iran. “We’re engaged with them on a regular basis,” she said, adding that contact between the team and the Department of Foreign Affairs is “very difficult” due to communications restrictions in Iran. “I don’t fear for their safety, but we do need to keep in contact with them,” she said. Advertisement Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin condemned the regime’s attacks on protestors and said the violence in Iran “must stop”. “I strongly condemn the brutal and violent suppression of protestors that has left hundreds of civilians dead in Iran over recent days,” he said in a statement on X. “The people of Iran have a fundamental right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. The repression must end. I urge the authorities in Tehran to uphold the rights of all their citizens. “The violence must stop, the curtailing of basic freedoms must end, and dialogue begin at once.” On Sunday, McEntee said she was “deeply concerned” by developments in Iran. This morning the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed the postponement of the formal ceremony to welcome the new ambassador. “The decision to postpone the ceremony of credentials for the Ambassador-designate of the Islamic Republic of Iran was taken in light of protests in Iran in recent days which have seen very significant numbers of Iranians killed or injured and a communications blackout,” a spokeswoman said. In a statement yesterday, the Iranian regime’s embassy in Dublin has claimed the Tehran Government is open to dialogue, committed to human rights and “peaceful assembly”. The Journal has requested a statement from the Iranian embassy in regard to today’s development. UK Diplomatic measures have also been taken in the UK, with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper telling the House of Commons today that her department had summoned the Iranian ambassador. Cooper said she had spoken to the Iranian foreign minister yesterday, “setting out the UK’s total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing”. The Foreign Secretary said: “Today, as the further reports have come through, the minister for the Middle East (Hamish Falconer) at my instruction has summoned the Iranian ambassador to underline the gravity of this moment, and to call Iran to answer for the horrific reports that we are hearing.” With additional reporting from Eimer McAuley Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...
