Title: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Says Tariffs Could Spook International Clients

In recent days, Wall Street CEOs have offered various predictions about how the Trump administration’s tariff policy could impact their business abroad. Some have cautioned unavoidable fallout, while others claim their international dealings won’t be impacted. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS), appears to fall somewhere in the middle.

You can opt out anytime. “What we’re hearing from clients, particularly clients in Europe and other places around the world, is they don’t like the level of uncertainty,” said Solomon during the investment bank’s first-quarter earnings call today (April 14). When it comes to how this sentiment will play out for a global financial institution like Goldman Sachs, “it’s early to call heads or tails,” noted the CEO. Markets have been reeling since April 2, when President Donald Trump unveiled the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs—an across-the-board 10 percent levy, with additional “reciprocal” duties targeting countries based on their trade deficits. China, notably, has seen its tariffs raised to 145 percent, while most of the other reciprocal levies have been paused for 90 days. But tariff-induced anxieties remain. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), warned last week that his bank “will be in the crosshairs” as international clients and countries begin to feel differently about American financial institutions. Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick had a more positive take last week, saying he remains “bullish” on his firm’s global business. Solomon, meanwhile, believes it’s too soon to tell. While the executive told analysts today that international clients are currently “extremely engaged” with the bank and there isn’t a decline of business on the horizon, Solomon noted that short-term concerns are particularly pronounced outside of the U.S. In some ways, recent market volatility has been beneficial to Goldman Sachs. Heightened levels of uncertainty have spurred a rise in trading, driving up the bank’s equity trading revenue to $4.19 billion in the first three months of this year—a 27 percent year-over-year increase. Total revenue climbed 6 percent to $15.06 billion for the quarter, and profit rose 15 percent to $4.74 billion. Both figures beat estimates. Goldman shares rose 2.3 percent on the results today. At the close of 2024, Solomon predicted a surge in mergers and acquisitions under a renewed Trump administration. So far, the reality has been the opposite. Goldman Sachs’ latest earnings reveal a clear slowdown in dealmaking, with investment banking fees dropping 8 percent year-over-year to $1.91 billion. The bank’s deal backlog has grown for the fourth consecutive quarter, Solomon noted, though he added that “our ability to execute on these transactions will, of course, be dependent on market conditions.” Solomon, like other Wall Street leaders, has become increasingly worried about said market conditions leading to a broader economic downturn. During today’s earnings call, he warned that slowing economic activity around the globe means that “the prospect of a recession has increased.” Dimon echoed similar concerns last week, putting the odds of a recession this year at 50/50. Other finance titans, like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), have declared that the U.S. might already be in one. For the time being, Solomon is urging calm. “My guess is, over time, this level of uncertainty will come down,” he said. “My general message to people is to go slow and take a pause here until we have more clarity around a lot of these issues.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: MSC Founder Emerges as Key Player in $19B Global Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network MSC ships at the Port of Long Beach. Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach By Alessandra Migliaccio and Tara Patel Bloomberg) — Gianluigi Aponte, the secretive Italian billionaire who founded MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, has emerged as a powerful broker in a $19 billion port deal with Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Aponte and his family-controlled Terminal Investment Ltd., known as TiL, are the main investors in a consortium that has proposed a $19 billion accord to buy 43 ports from Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings, people familiar with the matter have said. The grouping includes BlackRock Inc. and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, which will control two of the ports in Panama. GIP also has a minority stake in TiL. The deal has thrust the 84-year-old Aponte into an uncharacteristically high-profile position while underscoring his firm’s increasingly dominant role in worldwide shipping. MSC has grown to control about a fifth of global shipping capacity, and Aponte has a net worth of $25.6 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The low-key Aponte, silver-haired and slight of build, rarely speaks in public or gives interviews. His closely held company doesn’t publish financial reports or strategy updates. Still, he’s a member of the exclusive club of ultra-wealthy European shipping magnates who earned huge windfalls during the pandemic, and who’ve been expanding their empires ever since. The group includes the Maersk-Uggla family behind Danish container line AP Moller-Maersk A/S, Klaus-Michael Kuehne, Germany’s richest man, who has a 30% stake in Hapag-Lloyd AG, and Rodolphe Saade and his family, who control CMA CGM SA. The Aponte family traces its seafaring roots back to 1675, according to its corporate website. Gianluigi Aponte was born near the Bay of Naples, where the family traditionally ferried goods and passengers. He trained as a ship’s captain and later operated ferries shuttling wealthy tourists to island resorts like Capri and Ischia. It was on one of those trips that he met his future wife, Rafaela Diamant, the daughter of a Swiss banker. Aponte started MSC in 1970 after purchasing an old German break-bulk ship, and the following year he bought a second vessel, naming it after his wife. He soon began buying secondhand container ships, some from scrapyards, as he looked to break into a business dominated by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd. After carving out a niche on under-served routes, MSC eventually distinguished itself by emphasizing price over delivery speed. In the late 1980s Aponte made the jump into the leisure segment, and MSC Cruises became the world’s third-largest cruise brand. Like his European shipping peers, Aponte pushed heavily into ports and logistics. MSC’s pandemic-era profits fueled a further rapid expansion drive, and by 2022 it had achieved its founder’s goal of becoming the world’s biggest container carrier, dropping Maersk into second place. Aponte’s son Diego became MSC’s group president in 2014. Still, the senior Aponte remains highly active in MSC’s management as group chairman, with decision-making closely concentrated among the extended family, according to industry executives. Diego Aponte also heads the board of Geneva-based TiL where his father is a director, according to its website, which lists its shareholders as MSC, BlackRock’s GIP and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Italian tycoon — not BlackRock — emerges as lead investor in Panama ports deal: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/business/italian-tycoon-to-be-lead-investor-in-panama-ports-deal-report/

Italian tycoon Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business – not BlackRock – will be the lead investor of a group trying to buy 43 global ports, including key Panama Canal locations, from a Hong Kong business magnate, according to a report. BlackRock, however, will gain control of the two Panama ports included in the roughly $19 billion deal, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Terminal Investment Ltd., or TiL – the Aponte family’s Geneva-based firm – will take over all but two of the ports from CK Hutchison, a Hong-Kong based conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing, according to the report. The sale, which is facing steep opposition from Beijing, is reportedly set to be made to a group including TiL, BlackRock and investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners. GIP, which BlackRock acquired last year, has a minority stake in the Aponte firm. TiL, BlackRock and CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. However, the deal has faced considerable roadblocks as China pushes Li to scrap the sale, which offers desirable access to the Panama Canal — which President Trump has his eye on. Earlier this year, before BlackRock swooped in with a prospective deal, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to take control of the canal from Panama, arguing it’s “vital” for national security. His administration has since cheered the planned sale as a victory that will “take back” the waterway from Beijing. Meanwhile, an auditor employed by Panama’s government this month accused CK Hutchison of failing to renew its contract to operate the ports, claiming it owed the government $300 million. As for the deal, talks are still ongoing and details on the final structure may still change, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock’s GIP will own 51% of the two Panama ports, while TiL will take 49%, according to Bloomberg. These facilities account for about 4% of the total value of the deal, sources said. BlackRock and GLC Pte, a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, have a combined minority ownership of about 30% in TiL, sources told the outlet. The Aponte business was chosen for the deal, which had been open to several bidders, in part because of the family’s close ties to Li, sources told Bloomberg. CK Hutchison thought the ports would be in good hands with TiL, which operates more than 70 container terminals across 31 countries, they added. The port deal is still pending due diligence, tax and accounting checks, as well as approval from regulators, according to Bloomberg. And it has already faced delays. BlackRock was scheduled to sign an agreement by April 2, which has been postponed. Advertisement

Title: More than 60% of CEOs expect a recession in the next 6 months as tariff turmoil grows, survey says

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing majority of America’s top executives now expects the U.S. economy to enter a recession in the near future, according to a survey released Monday. Of the more than 300 CEOs polled in April, 62% said they forecasted a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months, according to Chief Executive, an industry group that runs the survey. That’s up from 48% who said the same in March. Chief Executive’s data underscores the growing concern within corporate America around the future of the U.S. economy. Fears about a forthcoming recession hit a boiling point in the last two weeks, as President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff policy ratcheted up volatility in financial markets and stirred panic among some consumers. Indeed, around three-fourths of CEOs surveyed said tariffs would hurt their businesses in 2025. About two-thirds said they did not support Trump’s proposed levies, many of which are currently on pause. The monthly survey, which has run since 2002, includes several data points that paint a concerning picture of how America’s foremost business leaders view the economy. An index of CEOs’ views on current business conditions tumbled 9% in April, continuing its decline after plunging 20% in the prior month. The measure now sits at its lowest level since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. When forecasting business conditions a year out, CEOs held their view steady from March. Still, these readings were the lowest since late 2012 and have tanked around 29% from the end of 2024. The survey found that more than four out of five chief executives project costs spiking this year, which is no surprise given the ongoing negotiations over import taxes between the White House and foreign countries. Around half forecast their percentage increases in expenses to be in the double digits. In this vein, just 37% said they believe their companies’ profits will increase. That’s a steep drop from the 76% who gave this response in January. To be sure, Chief Executive’s data set included a few bright spots. Slightly over half of respondents said they foresee business conditions bettering over the next year, an increase from the 39% share seen a month earlier. Many CEOs may be getting some tariff relief as well. Trump late Friday announced that smartphones and PCs would be exempt from duties, though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these exemptions would be temporary. Chief Executive’s data comes as U.S. business leaders have started flashing warning signs on the country’s economic future. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday that he expects earnings estimates for S&P 500 firms to fall due to the uncertainty around Trump’s levies. Also on Friday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned that the U.S. economy may have already weakened to the point of growth coming in negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: US Homeland Security investigates crypto bank Anchorage

Share this article The US Department of Homeland Security’s El Dorado Task Force has launched an investigation into Anchorage Digital Bank, the first and only chartered digital asset bank in the US, Barron’s reported Monday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The task force, which focuses on combating money laundering and other financial crimes, has contacted former Anchorage employees as part of its investigation. However, the details of the probe are currently unknown. Anchorage Digital is a recognized name in the digital asset space, having partnered with major institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed by Howard Lutnick, who currently serves as commerce secretary under the Trump administration, and also with BlackRock. Last November, Cantor Fitzgerald established a partnership with Anchorage and Copper to act as collateral managers and custodians for its new global Bitcoin financing business. The collaboration aims to offer top-tier digital asset custody services, starting with $2 billion in initial financing. BlackRock has recently tapped the bank for its spot crypto ETF custody. The fund management giant offers two spot ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the IBIT and ETHA funds. As of March 31, BlackRock’s spot crypto ETFs had around $50 billion in assets under management, according to its Q1 earnings report. This isn’t the first time Anchorage Digital has encountered regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took action against its banking arm for failing to meet BSA/AML obligations under its operating agreement.

Title: How the Business Community Turned Back Tariffs—for Now

Objections from business leaders played a key role in pushing the Trump Administration to reverse course on recently announced “reciprocal” tariffs, according to Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques. It’s a win for business, they write, but the business community remains concerned about uncertainty around economic policy. This commentary originally appeared in Time. The views expressed are the authors’ own.‌ It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs.‌ While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ‌ Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. ‌ Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation.‌ In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. ‌ Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. ‌ The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. ‌ The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. ‌ Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. ‌ The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here.

Title: Taoiseach hails €1bn-plus ‘Cluas’ light rail project in Cork

Full Content:
Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) The new €1bn-plus Cork light rail project will prove transformational for the city, the Taoiseach has promised. Micheál Martin was speaking as he launched the eight-week public consultation process on the emerging preferred route for the project, which has already been nicknamed 'Cluas' on Leeside. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km light-rail line with up to 25 stops running from Ballincollig through the city centre to Mahon Point. It will link key Cork destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. The scheme includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. No overall cost has yet been specified for the scheme but it has been projected at €1bn to €2bn. The emerging preferred route also includes a proposed 1,000-vehicle park & ride facility in Ballincollig and a special mobility hub in Mahon. Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) News in 90 Seconds - 14 April 2025 When fully operational, it will handle up to 2,300 passengers per hour with a forecast demand of 16 million passengers per annum. There will be no overhead cables in Cork city centre - and 65,000 Cork city residents will live within a 15-minute walk of a Luas stop. It will offer a 20-minute link between Mahon and Cork city centre and 35 minutes from the city centre to Ballincollig. A key element of the plan is a high-quality interchange at Cork's main railway hub, Kent Station. Mr Martin said light rail was vital to cater for the future transport needs of an expanding Cork. It will be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years with a population targeted to grow by 50pc to 60pc as the city strives to become a counterweight to Dublin and the east coast. The Taoiseach refused to specify a timeframe for completion of Luas Cork and said its rate of funding would be determined by future economic and fiscal issues. “Luas Cork will hugely improve connectivity in the city by modernising the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses," he said. "This is a very significant day for the public of Cork - this will be a transformative transport project for Cork city. "We are looking overall at a transport investment and network that will meet the needs of a growing city with a huge projected increase in population over the next 20 years. "It is very positive to see this project progressing and from that point of view I would like to acknowledge the work done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and indeed Cork City Council. “With the consultation process now open, I would encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views on this exciting proposal.” Transport Minister Darragh O'Brien said such public transport investments were absolutely crucial for Ireland successfully preparing for future population growth. "The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal. By providing a modern, reliable, and efficient public transport option, Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality." "The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” Lord Mayor of Cork Councillor Dan Boyle said the city had been waiting a long time for such a critical investment as Luas Cork. "It is a long-awaited, missing but vital link in the city's transport infrastructure, it will provide real choice to have more people travel by public transport, reduce car dependency, connect key locations and allow for significant additional growth in the development of the city." "The challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame." Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: President Trump: The Tariff Czar. Tariffs Impact Whose Economies?

Full Content:
President Trump called 2 April 2025 “Liberation Day” because this is the day when he announced new sweeping tariffs across the board, meaning, indeed, on all countries across the world. He might as well have called it “Day of Reckoning.” Did it signal the beginning of a global trade war? Or, is it just a game by which self-centered President Trump wants to show-off again, as being the one who commands the game, the one who can bend the world to its knees. Or so, he believes. But at what cost? And for whom to pay the cost? It is a dangerous game, more a gamble than a game. It is the gamble of a typical deal-maker – the extreme is “lose it all,” that is the direction this is going or win it all. “Win it all” for Trump, i.e. the US, is no option. There are too many smarter players around the globe. By now, at least 75 countries are begging Trump to “negotiate” bilateral tariff structures. It is not so much a question of cost for the partner countries, but for the US themselves. Washington has much more to lose than the rest of the world. Trump’s aim seems clear: 1) bring back outsourced manufacturing to the US; and 2) attract foreign new investments for manufacturing in the US, with significant tax breaks for new investors. The cost of either option is astronomical, and even if some countries / corporations are willing to take the risk of moving their manufacturing from a low-wage to a high-wage country – it doesn’t happen overnight. What happens in the meantime when new markets must be found? Who needs US goods? They hardly produce anything. Most everything you buy in the US is “made in China.” Even Trump’s red MAGA hat is “made in China.” American consumers will suffer the most. A couple of days ago, Trump increased tariffs for Chinese imports from 84% to 125%. He said, attempting to justify his move before the rest of the world, increased duties are intended to make China realize that “ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that this was “based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets.” Interesting though, how come everybody buys Chinese goods, not just because they are cheaper than US and other western goods, but also because Chinese quality in many cases is way superior. Chinese production is not subject to the US and western traditional corruption. Just look at the hundreds of billions-worth of corruption scandals the European Union (EU) is involved in, especially the unelected President Ursula Von der Leyen, or shall we say Dr. Von der Leyen, as in June 2022, she received an honorary doctorate from the Israeli Ben-Gurion University. See video below and this. Ms. von der Leyen said to her doctorate award: “Our democracy flourishes if Jewish life in Europe flourishes, too. Throughout the centuries, the Jewish people have been ‘a light unto the nations’. And they shall be a light unto Europe for many centuries ahead. (…) Long live Europe! Am Israel Chai!” Amen. This made Ursula Von der Leyen a forever Zionist, forever protected by the Zionists ruling the world; like President Trump when in 2017 he converted to Judaism. She is now not only guarded against several lawsuits, because the EU grants her diplomatic immunity, indeed also protecting her buddies-in-crime; but now she is also protected by the ever-Chosen People, the Zionists of Israel and around the world. * Back to the tariff game that must go on. It is an utterly destructive game in the end for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. Good for China, who does not need the US market as much as the US market needs China. China makes believe gambling in tandem with Trump. China just upped the ante. They increased their tariffs for US goods also to 125% – however saying, that is it. No higher. No matter what Trump does, we will not increase tariffs any further. In casino lingo that means, “Les jeux sont faits”. See this. Trump is – again – shooting from the hips. Or was and is it a plan? If it is a planned game, it could backfire miserably for the US. But Trump seems wanting to keep the game going, like a drunken gambler. In this game or gamble, the biggest players are China and to a lesser extent the EU. The EU is considering retaliation tariffs of 25%; while most individual EU countries talk about 20%. For now, tariffs are suspended for 90 days on both sides of the Atlantic, as negotiations are being “prepared”. The EU is divided. There are those who say enough is enough, let us open up to China and Asia in general. Eurasia is a natural partner and an already well-structured market. Forget the oppressive US of A. Others cannot believe that the US may drop the EU, and still want to adhere to this losing game by tallying up to Mr. Trump’s Washington. In the end, Europe has never been an independent force on her own – thousands of years of exploitation, back to the Roman Empire, and before, colonizing others, up to this very day. They will eventually fall by their own weight into the abyss created between the two fronts. Just in case, an EU retaliation would have similar effects on the European consumer – at a variation, depending on the importance of US imports for European consumers. This maybe the reason for EU’s semi-clandestine approach to China for increasing trade with China – of course, officially a “no-no”, according to the EU’s own copycat sanctioning of China, as dictated by the Trump Administration. For China, the game is already won. China for years has oriented its market towards Asia, the ASEAN countries, including the world’s largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), comprising of 15 Asia-Pacific nations. The agreement, under preparation for ten years, entered into force on 1 January 2022, encompasses about a third of the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP. The value of RCEP trade is expected to reach the equivalent of about third of the world’s GDP by 2030. China also has the Belt and Road Infrastructure, Investment and Trade Initiative spanning the globe, independently of Trump’s tariff fiasco. In addition, China, a cofounder of BRICS, is strongly committed to BRICS-plus inter-trading, as well as with the Global South (GS) in general. The GS will soon outstrip economic parameters of the G7. In Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the GS is already stronger than the G7. China has no market problem without the US. But the US are likely heading towards enormous internal socioeconomic problems, without Chinese goods or high duties on Chinese goods which make them unaffordable to the American consumer – especially middle and lower end consumers. Inflation and unemployment will be soaring. But the tariff game continues. It is a destructive game for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. China does not really need the US market as much as the US market needs China. Everything in the US is “made in China.” You stop the “Made in China” by ridiculous tariffs and the US comes to a standstill – because of inflation, labor loss and an uprooting of the American society – they may not take it. Specially the middle-lower income levels are losing sizable amounts of their purchasing power as compared with their 2024 incomes. Some analysts are comparing Trump to the stubborn Roman emperors. He cannot succeed. Irrespective of whether Trump politically survives his brutal tariff offensive, a U-turn is imminent, if he wants to avoid major domestic upheavals. The Budget Lab, a research center at Yale University, had estimated the toll on the average household at about US$ 3,800 annually, as compared with the spending power of 2024. See this for what it means in terms of inflation or consumer loss in 2024 US incomes. At the same time, Trump announced a military budget of about a trillion US dollars. This is brilliant logic of an extravagant megalomaniac. Or is there something else behind it? Are the global tariffs and the war budget deviously linked? According to the Budget Lab study, accumulated 2025 US import tariffs were scheduled to grow higher than ever since 1909. The stock market cratering alone wiped out about US$ 5 trillion. Since the first announcement of the tariff shock, the stock market has been like a roller-coaster. Some of the more significant market losses may be recuperated as Trump will negotiate bilaterally; or more, in case he will have to make an inevitable U-turn. Whatever you may call it, it is at best: “Radical policy changes” and an “unpredictable disruption.” In the light of the just announced one trillion US-dollar war budget, the imminent question arising: Is this game supposed to hide the fact that Trump is unable, or never was really willing, to achieve peace, neither in Ukraine, nor in the Middle East, because the profit stakes are too high for the war industry, and – possessing Ukraine and her riches is just too tempting to let it go. BlackRock has already privatized about half the country without most Ukrainians, let alone the rest of the world – noticing. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Goldman Sachs earnings jump but CEO sees 'markedly different' environment coming

Goldman Sachs (GS) opened the floodgates on first-quarter earnings Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. Strong trading revenues fueled the beat, and shares climbed 1.7% at the open — despite being down about 14% year-to-date. CEO David Solomon struck a confident tone while acknowledging extreme uncertainty amid chaotic U.S. policy turns. “In times of great uncertainty, clients turn to Goldman Sachs for execution and insight,” he said, while noting that Q2 has brought “a markedly different operating environment.” Goldman’s performance is a reminder that Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in turmoil. As a barometer of capital flows and investor sentiment, the bank’s earnings show that volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. The strong showing adds to solid reports from other financial giants last week, including BlackRock (BLK), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Still, clouds are forming: analysts at both Morgan Stanley and Citigroup (C) cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, warning of slowing earnings, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable U.S. policy. With heavyweight companies like Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) reporting in the days ahead, investors will be watching closely to see whether the bounce continues — or buckles under pressure.

Trump's tariff uncertainties lead to a draining investment landscape for crypto assets, except for rising XRP. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The digital asset market faced another challenging week, with $795 million in outflows recorded across crypto investment products, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This marks the third consecutive week of declines, underlining growing caution among investors navigating global economic headwinds. The ongoing streak of negative sentiment has pushed total outflows since early February to $7.2 billion. These withdrawals have nearly erased 2025’s earlier gains, leaving net inflows for the year at a modest $165 million. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that much of the recent investor caution stems from renewed tariff tensions involving the United States and China. Last week, the United States and China reignited their tariff dispute, each imposing a 25% levy on incoming goods. While President Donald Trump briefly paused broader tariff actions for 90 days, the damage to investor sentiment had already been done. CoinShares noted that short-term relief helped digital assets under management (AuM) climb to $130 billion, an 8% rebound from the April 8 low, the lowest level since November 2024. According to the report, Bitcoin products experienced $751 million in outflows, although the asset still maintains $545 million in year-to-date inflows. Major Bitcoin ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, saw significant fund exits during this period. Short Bitcoin products also experienced $4.6 million in outflows, suggesting that investors aren’t simply rotating into bearish positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum posted the second-largest outflows at $37.6 million, while other altcoins such as Solana, Aave, and Sui also saw declines of $5.1 million, $780,000, and $580,000, respectively. However, not all assets followed the trend. XRP continued to draw in fresh capital with inflows of $3.5 million last week, boosting its year-to-date inflows to $176 million, making it one of the best-performing digital assets in 2025. XRP’s inflow this year can be linked to the growing optimism over potential regulatory reforms and speculation around a spot XRP ETF in the US. Other altcoins, including Ondo, Algorand, and Avalanche, posted modest inflows of around $250,000 each, showing that niche investor interest in select assets remains intact despite broader market weakness.

Title: Trump's trade war is eroding US billionaires' fortunes — while China's are getting even richer

America's tech titans have lost billions this year while their Chinese rivals have racked up large wealth gains amid President Donald Trump's tariff-induced trade war. The tariffs have reignited fears of inflation and recession in the US, spurring investors to dump high-flying tech stocks in favor of safer holdings such as gold and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The sell-off has hammered the net worths of most of the richest Americans, whose stakes in tech companies make up the vast majority of their wealth. Trump has aimed some of the highest duties at imports from China, putting the world's second-largest economy under more pressure. Nevertheless, Chinese tech stocks have rallied strongly this year at the prospect of friendlier regulation and fresh government stimulus, boosting the fortunes of China's tech elite. As of Friday's close, the 20 biggest gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index have grown their combined wealth by $139 billion this year — more than BlackRock is worth. Meanwhile, the 20 largest wealth losers have seen $450 billion vaporized, a figure greater than Exxon Mobil's market value. It's striking that nine of the top 20 gainers are Chinese and only four are American, while 15 of the 20 biggest losers are American and none are Chinese. That trend may speak to how their companies' outlooks have changed, at least in the eyes of the global investment community, and how the US and China are expected to fare in the trade war. The Chinese executives racking up wealth this year include Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, and BYD founder Wang Chuanfu. They've jointly added a combined $26 billion, with Zhang gaining $13.6 billion, or 31%, to $57 billion — putting him in 24th place on the rich list. The US bosses hit hardest are Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. They've lost a collective $193 billion, with Musk shedding $121 billion or 28%. The richest Americans have lost far more than the Chinese elite have gained for a few reasons. Their fortunes are larger, so a 10% swing in their net worth is a bigger move in dollar terms. US stocks as a whole are more richly valued than Chinese equities, making them more vulnerable to steeper declines. It's also worth underscoring the greater role of the Chinese government in shoring up its markets and supporting domestic champions, which can help to limit declines in Chinese stocks. Vladimir Popov, a principal researcher at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute in Moscow, told Business Insider that China's more equal income and wealth distribution and more collectivist culture than the US were key to its global competitiveness — and thus the wealth of its richest executives. The economic development scholar added that China having fewer billionaires than the US, who wield less political influence than their American counterparts, help it to weather trade wars, probably because it's easier to maintain a united front. Chinese billionaires' wealth gains also reflect their companies' strong progress. For example, BYD's sales of electric and hybrid vehicles surged by 40% to a record $107 billion last year, surpassing Tesla's revenues of $98 billion, as the Chinese EV maker made inroads into foreign markets. Meanwhile, Tesla stock is under pressure not only because of Musk's proximity to Trump and leading role in cutting government spending and workers, but also because of concerns about tariffs and competition. Politics aside, Tesla has "struggled with an ageing line up, recalls of its much-vaunted Cybertruck and increased competition, especially from Chinese players like BYD," said Danni Hewson of AJ Bell in a recent note. If Chinese executives scale the global wealth ladder while American titans slide down the rungs, it could signal a sea change in market sentiment — and an upheaval of the global economic order.

Title: Kennedy Wilson refinances €472m of Irish apartment portfolio debt
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/14/kennedy-wilson-refinances-472m-of-irish-apartment-portfolio-debt/
Time Published: 2025-04-14T12:22:03Z
Full Content:
Kennedy Wilson, the US-based property investment giant, has secured a refinancing deal for $510 million (€472 million) related to debts secured against a portfolio of Irish apartments that were due to mature this year. The group, which last year sold its stake in Dublin’s five-star Shelbourne Hotel to Archer Hotel Capital for around €260 million, said the new five-year deal replaces an existing $537 million mortgage, which represented around 40 per cent of its total debt maturities for 2025. The debt is secured against several high-profile apartment schemes in the Republic, primarily in Dublin, comprising 1,689 units, or just under half of Kennedy Wilson’s 3,500-unit Irish portfolio. The properties – including Clancy Quay in Islandbridge, Dublin 8, the luxury Grange East scheme in Blackrock, as well as the Elysian in Cork – are co-owned by Kennedy Wilson and the investment arm of insurer Axa through a joint venture company. Occupancy rates across the portfolio are 99.5 per cent and the assets produce an annual operating income of around $40.3 million, Kennedy Wilson said on Monday in US Securities and Exchange (SEC) filings. The interest rate on the new financing is 4.2 per cent, according to the SEC documents. In a separate statement, the California-headquartered group said it had secured competitive terms from new lenders Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. “This refinancing process satisfied a large 2025 maturity for Kennedy Wilson and generated extremely strong market interest,” Mike Pegler, president of Kennedy Wilson Europe said. “We secured competitive terms from a diverse pool of over 30 potential lenders, including both local and international banks, insurers and debt funds. This is a testament to the quality of this portfolio as well as the underlying strength of the apartment market in Ireland, where we have invested since 2012.” The Irish Times reported in March that Kennedy Wilson was looking to secure upwards of €145 million from the sale of two prime office investments in Dublin’s city centre and docklands. CBRE and Knight Frank have been tasked by the US property giant with finding a buyer for 20 Kildare Street, which houses tenants includingAra Partners, Consello, Davidson Kempner Capital Management, Dentons, Egon Zehnder and Lanthorn and generates a rent roll of around €4 million annually. It is also understood to have instructed CBRE and Savills to sell office accommodation at Capital Dock, the landmark mixed-use scheme in Dublin’s south docklands.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/14 update below. This post was originally published on April 13 Donald Trump’s escalating global trade war has pushed markets to the brink this week, causing a spiralling U.S. dollar "confidence crisis" amid fears of "collapse." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The Federal Reserve, which stepped in to calm markets during the Covid panic, is closely watching the $29 trillion Treasury market for signs convulsions caused by Trump’s tariffs could turn into a full-blown financial crisis (while Wall Street braces for a looming “existential” threat). Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise prediction, a top Federal Reserve official has said it “would absolutely be prepared" to step in to rescue markets if U.S. president Trump’s trade war threatens the financial system. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has triggered chaos on financial markets with his on-again, off-again ... More trade war, tanking stock markets and sending the bitcoin price and crypto markets on a rollercoaster. “We have had to deploy quite quickly, various tools,” Susan Collins, head of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times, referring to previous times the Fed has moved to calm chaotic markets at times of low liquidity or market malfunctions. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” However, Collins, who fears Trump’s tariff trade war could send inflation back above 3% in 2025, said that currently “markets are continuing to function well” and that “we’re not seeing liquidity concerns overall," adding the Fed “does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise.” 04/14 update: JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced to step in and bail out the near-$30 trillion U.S. Treasury market following U.S. president Donald Trump’s campaign of rapid-fire global tariffs. “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations,” Dimon said in a Friday earnings call, warning that the Fed won’t act until “they start to panic a little bit." Dimon suggested the Fed could ditch a rule that exempts Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, something that would allow institutional investors to buy more bonds without breaking capital requirement rules. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The suggestion has been seized on as bullish by Bitmex cofounder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes, who posted to X that: “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.” "[Supplementary leverage ratio] exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital," Hayes added. Earlier this month, traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars—though Collins said emergency rate cuts would not be the Fed’s primary tool for responding to market’s failing. In 2020, ahead of one of the largest ever stock market rallies that saw the bitcoin price and crypto market surge to never-before-seen heights, the Fed restarted its 2008 financial crisis-era programs of quantitative easing while cutting rates to near-zero and scrapping its cap on the number of Treasuries it could buy—fueling expectations the Fed could again turbo charge the bitcoin price. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. Collins’ comments come as the New York Fed’s John Williams has warned that Trump’s tariffs could send inflation spiralling, caused a wave of unemployment and damage U.S. economic growth. This coming week, Fed chair Jerome Powell, who is at loggerheads with Trump over the need for interest rate cuts, is due to speak at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday in what will be a closely-watched speech.

More Trump's inauguration as global markets convulse over Trump's trade tariffs. Trump’s fast-moving approach to tariffs and trade negotiation—that’s seen China hit with levies of almost 150% before a carve out was announced for smartphones, computers and some other electronics—has seen the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jump 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% over the past week, spooking markets with its outsized swings. Crypto and stock markets have been on a rollercoaster that’s caused some of the most extreme volatility ever seen. After Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs, the S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever following a steep multi-trillion dollar sell-off. The notoriously volatile bitcoin price and crypto market has swung from highs of $3 trillion late March to lows of $2.5 trillion in early April before rebounding back toward $3 trillion. Meanwhile, business leaders on Wall Street and across the U.S. are warning the economy is buckling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned the U.S. may already be in a recession due to Trump’s sweeping tariffs while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon has said recession is the “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade war.

LAST UPDATE | 14 Apr THE EMERGING PREFERRED Route for Luas Cork has been launched today by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and is open to public consultation for the next eight weeks. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km long light rail line with up to 24 stops running from Ballincollig to Mahon Point. It will connect key destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. Luas Cork route map The scheme also includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. The Emerging Preferred Route also includes a proposed 1000 vehicle Park & Ride facility in Ballincollig and a Mobility Hub in Mahon. Cork is planned to be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years, with a population targeted to grow by 50 to 60% and projects such as Luas Cork are seen as vital to delivering the large-scale regeneration and investment planned for Cork. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and the National Transport Authority (NTA) is inviting the public to participate in the consultation on www.luascork.ie. The consultation is open until Monday 9 June at 5.30pm. There will also be a number of open days across the city during the consultation where drawings can be inspected and staff from TII will be available to answer questions. Martin described the announcement today of the Emerging Preferred Route a “significant step in an infrastructure project that will be transformational for Cork city”. He added that it is government’s plan to do “whatever we can effectively and in a timely matter”. Advertisement Martin said the project will “modernise the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses”. “With the consultation process now open, I’d encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views,” said Martin. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Darragh O’Brien TD noted that Cork has been selected by the European Commission as one of Europe’s first climate-neutral cities. In 2022, the European Commission announced that Cork is to become one of Europe’s first climate neutral cities. Cork, along with Dublin, was selected from a group of 337 cities to participate in the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030. “The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal,” said O’Brien. “Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality. “The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” O’Brien, who last month said the Luas Cork could cost between €2 billion and €3 billion, added that it’s “very difficult to estimate” how much the project will cost. Lord Mayor of Cork City Dan Boyle meanwhile remarked that the “challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame”. Elsewhere, Hugh Creegan, interim CEO of the NTA said that Luas Cork will be the “new era of public transport which will enable Cork to develop into an accessible, connected and vibrant city” while Peter Walsh, CEO of TII, said he looked forward to hearing from the public before progressing to the next stage of design. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said that she wants to “see things moving very fast”. “It has taken too long,” said Bacik, who called for construction to begin by 2030. “There is a very clear outline coming through and things should move on swiftly and we will be pushing government to make sure it does progress at pace.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Ethereum vs. Ripple: Will XRP overtake ETH in the next 3 years?

Institutional participants show mixed signals as ETH struggles. As Ethereum [ETH] faces mounting pressure, ETF outflows have surged 39% in just one week, signaling shaken investor sentiment. Yet, in a show of confidence, BlackRock has doubled with a massive $1.8 billion ETH position, reinforcing institutional faith in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Just as the dust settles, Standard Chartered has stirred the pot, forecasting that Ripple [XRP] could overtake Ethereum within the next three years. With market dynamics shifting, the race for crypto’s second spot is entering what looks like a high-stakes war zone. Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly net outflows of $82.47 million – marking the largest drawdown in recent months. The chart reveals a clear trend: consistent outflows since mid-February, aligning with Ethereum’s price drop to $1.5K. Source: SoSoValue Total net assets have also steadily declined, now at $5.24 billion, down from a peak above $12 billion in late 2024. This suggests waning short-term investor confidence, even as macro conviction remains strong – evidenced by large institutions like BlackRock increasing exposure. The disconnect hints at a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s market narrative. Despite mounting ETF outflows, BlackRock has solidified its conviction in Ethereum with a $1.8 billion ETH position. The portfolio shows steady accumulation through 2024, signaling a long-term belief in Ethereum’s value proposition. However, a surprising twist enters the frame: Standard Chartered’s latest report forecasts XRP overtaking Ethereum in market cap by 2028. Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research, sees XRP rising to become the second-largest non-stablecoin asset, setting up a high-stakes rivalry. The result is a fascinating divergence in institutional outlooks — one doubling down on ETH, the other betting big on XRP. The mixed signals reveal just how uncertain and dynamic the road ahead for crypto’s top contenders truly is. Ethereum’s price hit $1,603 at press time, following a 2.47% daily drop. The broader trend since early 2025 has been decisively bearish, with ETH shedding significant value from above $3,000 levels earlier in the year. The RSI hovered near 39, indicating oversold territory but not yet signaling a strong reversal. Meanwhile, the MACD line sat just below the signal line, suggesting ongoing bearish momentum — although the gap is narrowing, hinting at potential bullish divergence. Source: TradingView Despite BlackRock’s conviction, technicals suggest ETH is still struggling to find solid footing. Any short-term relief rally could face resistance near the $1,800 zone, while a drop below $1,550 could intensify selling pressure.

Title: Topgolf Founders Raise $34 Million For Poolhouse, Their Latest Sports Startup

ByTim Casey ByTim Casey, Senior Contributor. FILE - David Blitzer participates in a New Jersey Devils press conference Thursday, Aug. 15, 2013, ... More in Newark, N.J. Major League Baseball has approved the sale of a minority stake in the Cleveland Guardians to David Blitzer, who also has ownership shares in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, two people familiar with the deal told the Associated Press on Thursday, June 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Poolhouse, a United Kingdom-based startup founded by the brothers behind Topgolf, has raised $34 million in a seed round. The company plans on using the proceeds to further develop its technology, gain a foothold in the competitive sports-themed entertainment retail industry and open locations where people can play a high-tech version of pool while eating, drinking and socializing. The seed round was co-led by Sharp Alpha, a venture capital firm based in New York, and dmg ventures, the venture capital arm of DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail newspaper among other holdings. David Blitzer, who owns a stake in the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils and invests in sports-focused startups, participated in the round, as did investment firms Simon Sports and Active Partners. Poolhouse declined to disclose the valuation of the company following the seed round, some of which it raised via a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) note that will convert to equity when the company raises a planned Series A next year. Poolhouse is the brainchild of twins Dave and Steve Jolliffe, who in 2000 started Topgolf to enhance the experience of going to a golf driving range. Topgolf merged in 2021 with Callaway in a deal that valued Topgolf at $2.1 billion. There are now 96 Topgolf locations in the U.S. and 12 locations in other countries. The Jolliffe brothers also founded Puttshack, a miniature golf entertainment concept that raised $150 million in October 2022 from Blackrock. There are 16 Puttshack locations in the U.S. and four in the United Kingdom. Poolhouse plans on opening its first venue early next year in London. The 21,348-square-foot, two-story building is located next to the city’s Liverpool Street Station and will house 20 pool tables with food and beverage options. The Poolhouse venues will have regular sized pool tables and pool cues, but the company has developed technology that will enhance the experience, including superimposing images on the table, creating various games people can play and allowing them to track their progress on an app and video screens. The company also has a system that can track how good players are and a handicapping system similar to golf that makes it more competitive among players who have various abilities. Andrew O’Brien, a former Credit Suisse banker who invested in Puttshack and sits on the board of F1 Arcade, is Poolhouse’s CEO and runs its day-to-day operations. Steve Jolliffe is Poolhouse’s executive chairman and speaks with O’Brien every day. The Jolliffes remain the largest individual shareholders in Poolhouse, according to O’Brien. “The look and the feel will be important, but ultimately, it’s what the Jolliffes did with Topgolf,” O’Brien said. “They create amazing technology to transform an existing sport. There's a reason why there weren't any Topgolf rivals for 20 years. It’s because they're very strong on the patent side of things. They don't just design pretty. They design things that are difficult to replicate.” O’Brien added: “With Poolhouse, I think they’ve done something very similar. They've created something on the back of technology, which is real pool tables, real pool balls, real cues. Everything's the same, but they've infused technology into it to augment the experience.” After launching in London, Poolhouse plans on opening two sites in the U.S., one in late 2026 and another in early 2027. The company plans on opening four to five locations per year in the U.S. starting in 2027 in downtown locations of major cities such as Boston, Chicago, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Poolhouse will lease space in buildings rather than own the buildings. Poolhouse has also struck a franchising agreement in Australia with Signature Hospitality Group, which has an equity stake in Poolhouse. Poolhouse expects to sign additional franchising or joint venture agreements in other countries. In addition, the company plans on licensing its technology to traditional pool halls, casinos, restaurants, apartment complexes and even homes or anywhere else that has a pool table. “We think there’s huge scope for this to be scaled across the world at quite a pace,” O’Brien said. Lloyd Danzig, managing partner of Sharp Alpha, said the venture capital firm spent 12 to 18 months evaluating companies in what he refers to as the “competitive socialization” or “eatertainment” industry, referring to Topgolf, Puttshack, F1 Arcade and other companies where people gather to socialize, eat, drink and compete in an activity. Sharp Alpha was looking for companies that had high food and drink spend at its venues, were conducive to corporate events, featured activities that could be done on a regular basis rather than a one-off basis and had proprietary software that could be licensed to a third parties at a high margin. He said he believes Poolhouse will meet all of those criteria. “They, more than any other concept we’ve come across, really embody all four of those features,” Danzig said. “The confluence of what we’re bullish on at the category level and also at the concept level and what they’re building dovetailed with just an absolutely incredible management and executive team. We give these guys an 11 out of 10 on founder-market fit.”

Title: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Secures 'First and Free' Passage for U.S. Ships in Panama Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/13/defense-sec-pete-hegseth-secures-passage-u-s-ships-panama-canal/

PANAMA CITY, Panama — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had one mission on his trip to Panama — to secure a deal to get “first and free” passage for U.S. ships in the Panama Canal, a critical waterway for the United States’ economy and military that was at risk of falling under China’s control. As the secretary and his team flew down from Washington on Monday evening to meet with Panama’s leaders, such a deal with Panama was far from certain. While the U.S. had built the canal in the early 1900s and maintained it for decades before handing it over to Panama in the 1990s, China had in recent years poured money into projects and infrastructure attached to it. As a passageway between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that handles more than 40 percent of U.S. maritime trade, if China were able to close the canal, it would be a catastrophe for the U.S. President Donald Trump, early on in his administration, made retaking the canal from Chinese influence a top priority. In December, even before he took office for the second time, he posted about it on Truth Social: In February, Trump dispatched Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Panama during his first international trip, where he successfully persuaded Panama to not renew its participation in BRI (the Belt and Road Initiative), a major win for the United States. Then, in March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerated named CK Hutchinson sold two ports along the canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock, which would put the two ports located at each end of the canal under American ownership. Trump touted the deal during his Joint Address to Congress. The Chinese government then launched an investigation into the deal to delay it. Now, it was up to Hegseth to secure U.S. ships’ “first and free” passage through the canal. By all measures, the trip was a resounding success. Hegseth arrived late Monday. On Tuesday, the secretary met with President José Raúl Mulino, Minister of Public Security Frank Abrego, and Panamanian legislators, visited the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base that was formerly a U.S. naval base, and inaugurated a pier refurbished by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He also visited Fort Sherman, a former U.S. Army base, the Jungle Warfare School, toured the Panama Canal by helicopter, and visited the Miraflores Locks. He later met with Abrego again, as well as regional leaders attending the 2025 Central American Security Conference. On Wednesday, Hegseth delivered opening remarks at the conference, which was co-hosted by the U.S. and Panama. It was there that Hegseth announced that the U.S. and Panama would sign a declaration providing a framework for U.S. warships and auxiliary ships to travel “first and free” through the canal, in a huge win for the U.S. Hegseth and Abrego also agreed to an expanded partnership to secure the canal and signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperative security activities between the U.S. and Panamanian militaries, which will see the increase of U.S. troops in Panama. Asked by Breitbart News if he had accomplished everything he wanted to on the trip, a triumphant Hegseth responded, “This trip not only met but exceeded our expectations. A warm welcome from Panama. Great partnership. Spent a lot of time with their troops. I want to thank Panama for what they’ve done in the Darien Gap as well.” The trip was not only a success for the U.S. economically, but also geopolitically. Despite Beijing attempting to pressure Panama by launching an investigation into the CK Hutchison’s sale to the BlackRock-led consortium, Panama remained undeterred in its walkaway from China and reinvigorating its ties with the U.S. A senior defense official told reporters traveling with Hegseth, “If you look at the context of countering Chinese spheres of influence around the world, this is a good example of actions taken by the secretary and by his team about how we align perfectly within the realm of that strategy.” “When we talk about the larger global strategy in deterring China … people start to realize very quickly that an alliance with China is not all it [is] cracked up to be,” the official added. “The [Chinese Communist Party] is very exploitative of the relationships that they have and that wasn’t just true of our time in Panama, it was the also the same in Japan.” Senior defense officials also credited Trump for creating the opportunity and confidence for countries who want to work with the U.S. and leave exploitive relationships with China. “President Trump’s words have resonated with them in terms of negotiating the bolstering of our alliances,” another senior defense official said, adding: President Trump made it a point to talk about Panama within his first 30 days of taking office. … The reason why we’re even having this conversation in the first place is because President Trump focused on on the Panama Canal, and I think it’s going to do lot for our country in terms of opportunity with the Panamanians, but ultimately for our hemisphere. During his visit, China responded angrily to the prospect of further cooperation between the U.S. and Panama, accusing the U.S. of “blackmail.” When asked if he was concerned by retaliation by China, Hegseth responded, “No.” “I’m not worried about retaliation from China. We will stand on our own merits. Peace through strength matters. We represent our interests, put America first, President Trump is staring them down on trade. We will reestablish deterrence as well,” he said. Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on X, Truth Social, or on Facebook. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: An Individual Is Ready To Invest $10,000 And Turns To Reddit For Advice: 'I'm Looking For A Decent Yield And A Little Growth'

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Investing money into dividend stocks can result in steady cash flow. Gradually putting money into these investments will increase your dividend income over time, but some people receive a windfall of cash that they can deploy right away. One Redditor finds themselves in that position. The individual is set to have $10,000 sometime next week and has been following the Dividends subreddit for a while. Now, after consuming content from the group for a while, the Redditor is looking for advice. "I'm looking for a decent yield and a little growth," the Redditor explained when asking for recommendations. Don't Miss: In addition to the immediate $10,000 investment, the Redditor aims to invest $250 each month. Other Redditors shared their thoughts in the comments. One commenter suggested staggering the $10,000 investment instead of putting it all into the market at once. This approach can help the Redditor capitalize on any price dips instead of unloading all of their capital and watching their assets lose value. Many investors on Reddit seem to be jittery about the recent trade war. The popular consensus on Reddit is that the market will continue to tank, and that fear showed up again in the comments. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. An investor who wants to dollar cost average as the market goes down may want to consider breaking the $10,000 investment into several investments. The amount of times you break down the $10,000 should depend on your risk tolerance, your thoughts about current prices, and what you think the stock market will look like in five to 10 years. The original poster mentioned some ETFs and received comments that suggested some ETFs as well. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD was the first ETF the original poster mentioned. It's no surprise to see SCHD mentioned in the Dividends subreddit since it seems to be a fan favorite. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY, JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, and the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI were some of the other ETFs that were mentioned in the post and the comments.

However, these recommendations don't mean much since we don't know much about the Redditor. One of the top commenters pointed this out. ‘What to invest in depends a lot on your personal situation. You didn't provide any details about age, income, investment objectives (other than decent yield and a little growth, which is a relative idea), risk tolerance, jurisdiction, investment currency, etc., so it's hard for any meaningful advice to be given." The best stocks and ETFs for one person may be different from the best assets for another person. Some people pursue high-yield stocks as they get closer to retirement, while others buy growth stocks when they are younger to maximize their potential returns. Personal details like risk tolerance and income play a role in which stocks and ETFs make sense for you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's multifront trade war whipsaws markets, and China fires back. What's next, as the world's two biggest economic powers clash? (Begin VT) (CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: The 47th president of the United States! (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: After one of the most volatile weeks in Wall Street history, President Trump spent his Saturday night at a UFC match and hyped his combative approach on trade policy. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We have lots of fights going around the world. And I think we have a lot of good news coming soon about some of those fights. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite backing off of what he called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries and announcing new exemptions on some key consumer products, the president is digging in on tariffs against China. We will discuss what's next with U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. And we will get a read on the economic impact from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari. Silicon Valley's congressman, Democrat Ro Khanna, will weigh in on how the trade war may impact big tech. Plus, we will have a new poll on how Americans think Trump is handling the economy. And, finally, an update on the measles outbreak with the former top vaccine regulator with the FDA Dr. Peter Marks. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Our new CBS poll shows President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 47 percent. That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes. The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers. Speaking with reporters last night, the president said more details would be revealed Monday. For more, we go to United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): Good morning, Margaret. How are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level. Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries. In the past, you've talked – you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan. President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans. And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here. MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a – it's not a brand-new development. You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so – so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So, it's not – it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips. Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen. (Begin VT) HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them. Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is – it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera. So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is – that is subject to study by the Commerce Department. MARGARET BRENNAN: But… AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China. MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are – quote – "exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption." Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8. (Begin VT) NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret. We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we – we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera. They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: … because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced? I mean, he – he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What – what time frame are we talking about? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have – for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's – that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome. (CROSSTALK) AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: …. investigations for those. No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're – you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it… AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that – and that's a Commerce Department function to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of – of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current – including their currency. Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States. In the USMCA and in the Japan-China – the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term. The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has – has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition – you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a – we're in a nefarious situation. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But – but – but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right? So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm – I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming. This was – this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers. I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I – I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see. I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president – I know you were testifying on – on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs. He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy – quote – "We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart." He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of – that type of discussion had been happening for – for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart. But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order. So – so lawyer – you know, trade lawyers like – like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's – forms the basis for these tariffs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation. NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America? You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what – yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you – what concerned you? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If – what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up. NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7? NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But, obviously, this is the biggest – in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy. And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession. Is the risk that high, in your estimate? NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is – are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point? NEEL KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're – as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more Face the Nation. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King will be making history, traveling in an all-woman crew into space. Mark Strassmann has a preview. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): In Blue Origin's training capsule, CBS' Gayle King got a sense of tomorrow's thrill ride, a trip 62 miles straight up to the edge of space. GAYLE KING: And I realize this is so much bigger than just a fun trip, what it represents to young women, to girls, what they're trying to do on space in terms of looking at the planet in another way. MARK STRASSMANN: Space tourism, civilian astronauts, took off four years ago. Three space companies, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, have rocketed more than 120 people into space, including billionaire Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin's founder, in 2021. Did this moment motivate you to push deeper into the cosmos? JEFF BEZOS (FOUNDER, Amazon): Hell yes. (LAUGHTER) JEFF BEZOS: Yes, absolutely, no doubt. We have to build a road to space. The several tourism missions is about practicing. LAUREN SANCHEZ (Journalist): What are we doing? KATY PERRY (Musician): We're going to space. LAUREN SANCHEZ: Oh, we're going to space. MARK STRASSMANN: Bezos' fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, put together Monday's all female-crew, six accomplished women, including King, pop star Katy Perry, two scientists and a filmmaker. Their 11-minute round-trip adventure will include roughly three minutes of weightlessness, floating in the capsule, looking out a window onto the world below. CBS News space analyst Bill Harwood: BILL HARWOOD: It's something we all marvel at, but I think getting from there to the point where the average person can do this is decades away, if not longer. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Liftoff will happen here in West Texas from a launchpad on a mammoth ranch owned by Jeff Bezos. Gayle admits she's both excited and terrified – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we wish Gayle a very safe flight. Our special coverage of the historic mission will begin tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Be sure to tune in. Face the Nation will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from our latest poll on President Trump's economic policies, plus Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna and the former director of the FDA's vaccine program. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right? The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change. But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out. So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now. But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down. But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a - MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now. But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue. Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio. Good morning to you, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area. Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law. MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights. And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional. MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space. But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program. Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there. Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress. And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes. In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term. But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam. So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy. And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam. And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States. So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy claimed last week that the measles outbreak may be plateauing, but the highly contagious virus continues to spread mostly in unvaccinated people. And the CDC reports that the number of cases topped 700 in 2025 so far. The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states. We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook, earlier this week following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated, people should get the MMR vaccine. Take a listen. DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position, philosophically, of the federal government in terms of public health? ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those. LAPOOK: Understand. But the - KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them. LAPOOK: Right. KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement? PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison. MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration. PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services. Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA? PETER MARKS: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now? PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies. Did you ever speak to him about your concerns? PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying? PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here. You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies. And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience - MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community. PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community. My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around. MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause. On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this. KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures. MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research? PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there. I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong. If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way. And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic. KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD? PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism. There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality. MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent. So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government? PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here. What I think we can expect is the expected, that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.

Watch CBS News Updated on: April 13, 2025 / 1:49 PM EDT / CBS News The following is the transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on April 13, 2025. MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation. NEEL KASHKARI: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like 2 billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country? KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag Leader two days ago in Minnesota who said that even if there's a 10% tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China because it's a competitive global market, it's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so in many sectors, whether it's a 10% tariff or 50% or 100% tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil. So looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that? KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, 'Hey, there are other places we also want to invest.' That it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored. MARGARET BRENNAN: So people typically think of US Treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the President says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did? KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the US and around the world are trying to determine what is the new normal in America. You know, I saw an interview on Friday where Blackrock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10 year treasury would go to a 5% yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for where are these trade negotiations going to end up. Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5% treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100% determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see and at the Fed. Our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what, what concerned you? KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near term ups and downs in the economy, but ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the central bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building in the house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If, what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up. KASHKARI: Well there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one time adjustment in prices and nothing longer term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs in a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until what, May 7? KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But obviously we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy, January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But obviously this is the biggest in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I've been at the Fed, except for March of 2020 when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy, and we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45% chance of recession. Is the risk that high in your estimate? KASHKARI: You know it's really going to be determined by are there quick resolutions? To your prior guests. Are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and hopefully those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation if everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself. Setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point? KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously the market participants are trying to grasp for where is this all going to settle, and that's causing volatility as they're, as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected, but markets are functioning, transactions are happening, and so I anticipate that's going to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more. Face the Nation. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ride The Wave Of Metaphors That Move Markets To Sharpen Your Communication Skills

ByCarmine Gallo ByCarmine Gallo, Senior Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 11: Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, speaks with David Faber and Jim Cramer ... More on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) In these times of turmoil over tariffs, stocks don’t simply move up and down. They don’t merely post a gain or a loss for the week. Instead, they send investors on a ‘roller coaster’ ride as stock prices plummet and plunge, soar and surge. While there’s no telling where the stock market goes from here, one thing we know for sure: financial leaders, writers, and commentators will continue to search for the fewest words to explain the most complex actions. And, to do so, they’ll reach for a metaphor. If you want to be a better communicator—more persuasive and engaging— pay attention to financial writers and commentators who translate complex information into words and ideas that are easy to understand. Effective communication is a skill and like any skill it can be learned. One way to learn a skill is to watch experts do it and to ask questions. In this case, why and when do skilled communicators reach for a metaphor? A metaphor is a figure of speech comparing two different things to show their similarities. When Shakespeare wrote that “Juliet is the sun,” we all know that she wasn’t the actual sun but in those four words we understand that she brightens Romeo’s world. Shakespeare knew the secret all great writers have come to learn: metaphors serve as a cognitive bridge between the intangible and the familiar. They save words, speak volumes, and create vivid images in our minds. The bewildering complexity of global financial movements is far too abstract for most of us to grasp, so we instinctively look for something to compare. When we find a comparison that works, we repeat it. How many times have you read that the economy is in for a “soft landing” or a “hard landing?” We know the economy is not an airplane, but we understand the phrase because it’s a physical sensation we’ve experienced, just like a fall, a crash, or a recovery. My favorite headline of the week comes courtesy of The Wall Street Journal: “Trade-War Jitters Batter Stocks.” It’s impossible to add more metaphors to that headline because every word—including stocks—is a metaphor for an abstract concept. In just five words, the Journal’s headline compresses volumes of complex information: International relations and strategic alliances, policy mechanics, market psychology, and quantitative models. Far from “dumbing down” content, a good metaphor makes it more likely that people will listen to your ideas because you’re making those ideas come alive. They’re more vivid and, as a result, more likely to be remembered. Pay attention to guests who are repeatedly invited to share their outlook on business shows—and pay extra attention to the headlines that come out of those interviews. You’ll find that those who create more intriguing metaphors tend to grab the public’s attention. When JPMorgan Chase released its 2025 Q1 financial results, the press release alone was more than 3,000 words. But CNBC picked up on two words from CEO Jamie Dimon. The economy, he said, is facing “considerable turbulence.” CNBC’s commentators and hosts ran the headline and played off the metaphor for an entire day. The metaphor became the story. Dimon, known for his clearly written annual shareholder letters, carefully selected a metaphor that accurately reflected his opinion. Turbulence is not a crash, but it can get uncomfortable. Turbulence can also be mild or extreme, which is why Dimon also said his company has built a fortress balance sheet that enables the bank to be a pillar of strength during volatile or challenging times. Dimon knows a good metaphor when he sees it, as do financial experts who follow and interpret the markets for the public. Your readers and listeners process complex concepts by reaching for familiar comparisons. Throw them the right metaphor—a cognitive lifeline—and they’ll not only pay attention, they’ll remember you.

Title: Even on Pause, Trump's Trade War Runs Up a Big Price Tag

Tariffs J.D. Tuccille | 4.14.2025 7:00 AM If you're keeping track—and economists are making their best efforts—President Donald Trump's trade war with the entire planet is running up quite a price tag. Even with a 90-day pause on some tariffs (except for China), the imposition or even just the threat of import taxes on goods from around the world and the inevitable retaliation by other countries is expected to take a bite out of the economy and people's prosperity. Figuring out how much of a bite it will take is a trick, but there's little doubt that it will be painful. You are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason. Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty. Δ The grimmest assessment of the trade war's impact so far may come from the Penn-Wharton Budget Model (PWBM). In an analysis considering costs of the Trump administration's tariff plans as of April 8, economists and data-crunchers Lysle Boller, Kody Carmody, Jon Huntley, and Felix Reichling warned that "many trade models fail to capture the full harm of tariffs." Using their own model, the authors project that tariffs announced so far "would reduce GDP by about 8% and wages by 7%" over time. The tariffs, the PWBM team adds, affect the economy through three main channels: The tax on imported goods imposes costs on consumers and businesses in the United States, with consumers suffering the brunt of it in the longer term; the reduction in imported goods "means foreign businesses and governments will purchase fewer U.S. assets, including U.S. federal government bonds"; and increased economic policy uncertainty from the tariff announcements will reduce economic activity as businesses and individuals put off investment, hiring, and spending while they wait to see how matters shake out. The PWBM analysis concluded that the tariffs would raise revenue roughly equivalent to increasing the corporate income tax from 21 percent to 36 percent, or $5.2 trillion over 10 years. "While raising the corporate tax rate is generally seen as highly economically distorting, tariffs would reduce GDP and wages by more than twice as much," the authors caution. What that would mean in real terms for average Americans, they add, is that "a middle-income household faces a $58K lifetime loss." The Tax Foundation has also been tracking the cost of the trade war in an ongoing analysis by Erica York, vice president of federal trade policy, and senior economist Alex Durante. As of April 11, they "estimate tariffs will cause imports to fall by slightly more than $800 billion in 2025, or 24 percent." Revenue-wise, they see tariffs raising $2.2 trillion over the next decade. Obviously, that big an effect on trade will also have an impact on the U.S. economy. "We estimate that before accounting for any foreign retaliation, Trump's tariffs will reduce long-run US GDP by 0.8 percent," York and Durante warn. "As of April 10, threatened and imposed retaliatory tariffs affect $330 billion of US exports based on 2024 US import values; if fully imposed, we estimate they would reduce US GDP by 0.2 percent. Combined, the US-imposed tariffs and the threatened and imposed retaliatory tariffs reduce US GDP by 1.0 percent." As does PWBM, the Tax Foundation expects the Trump administration's tariffs and resulting retaliation to hurt the U.S. economy. But there's a substantial difference between the Tax Foundation's negative forecast and the darker predictions of PWBM. The economists at PWBM already said they think other models underestimate the impact of tariffs. By email, I asked York for her take on the difference between her organization's calculations and the PWBM numbers. "While tariffs are more economically harmful than a simple analysis suggests due to how they affect capital investment and productivity growth, PWBM's approach and findings seem very aggressive," she responded. She added that the grimmer predictions "are very far outside the range of what other modeling finds." That said, the disagreement between the two analyses is one of degree; both concur that a trade war will hurt Americans. Part of the difference is a matter of uncertainty over economic policy, foreign and domestic, which PWBM notes "generally depresses economic activity by prompting firms and households to postpone investment, hiring, and consumption decisions." That point was emphasized by Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, who last week wrote, "the significant increase in economic uncertainty will likely reduce firms' desire to invest." Agreeing with that point is Larry Fink, CEO of the financial firm BlackRock. "I think you're going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there's more certainty," Fink told CNBC on Friday. "And we now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs—that means longer, more elevated uncertainty." From a trade perspective, it's good that tariffs have been partially paused—again, except for China. But a 90-day pause isn't a cancellation of the trade war; it just kicks the can down the road. Until people know whether tariffs will eventually be hiked, and the degree to which other nations will retaliate, many would-be investors are likely to sit on their hands, businesses will hold off on committing to deals, and consumers will put off purchases. The almost certain result is a big hit to the economy. "I think we're very close, if not in, a recession now," Fink added. It's probably a mistake to look to economic models for precise crystal-ball gazing. When it comes to this trade war—or most economic policies—the economists are better pointing to a direction rather than a specific destination. "Economics is not about forecasting," comments economist and Hoover Institution senior fellow John Cochrane. "Most of what happens comes from external shocks. Economics is better at cause and effect—what is the effect of tariffs?" And most economists agree on the effects of tariffs in general, the protectionist measures imposed by both the first Trump and subsequent Biden administrations, and the draconian trade barriers now championed by the second Trump administration. They'll hurt the U.S. economy and make us poorer. It may be too soon to forecast the precise costs of protectionism and of starting a trade war with the entire world, but we can be sure that it will run up an enormous price tag.

Title: Wall Street woes will hammer NYC — so Eric Adams must cut spending NOW

After a week of tariff-driven ups-and-downs in the financial markets, New York City’s economy may soon start feeling woozy. The longtime finance capital stands to lose more than just luster in a rapidly de-globalizing world: Billions in city tax revenue and thousands of jobs are on the line. Greater uncertainty will make foreign and domestic companies more risk-averse, turning them away from dealmaking. Fewer buyouts and mergers mean leaner times — and not just for investment bankers and hedge fund tycoons. It may be hard to pity an industry whose members in the city get bonuses averaging $244,000, but New York runs on Wall Street. Besides generating 20% of Gotham’s total income, finance funds a big chunk of the city’s essential services and safety net. About 23% of the city’s personal income tax collections and 7% of its total tax revenue come from the securities industry, according to state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. That’s more than $5 billion annually out of the current year’s $112 billion budget. History shows that the city’s fortunes are joined at the hip with Wall Street’s. By 1977, Wall Street jobs had dwindled to 70,000, declining by some 30% during that bad old decade. As the city clawed back from fiscal ruin, the finance industry boomed in the Gordon Gekko 1980s, more than doubling employment to 160,000. That set the stage for the extraordinary safety improvements and prosperity of the feel-good 1990s. Today, big banks, hedge funds and asset managers lease space in or own the city’s choicest skyscrapers and spend big bucks on corporate-card dinners, making them indispensable to real estate, restaurants and retail. Yet New York needs Wall Street far more than Wall Street needs New York. Securities jobs in the city peaked in 2000, when they numbered roughly 200,000, and fell after 9/11. A quarter-century later, despite the sector’s enormous growth, the industry accounts for about 195,000 Big Apple jobs. The reason? Competitors like Dallas and Miami are eating New York’s lunch, as firms increasingly choose to locate new operations in the Sun Belt. Texas surpassed the Empire State’s total finance employment a decade ago, and the gap has only widened since. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Citadel Securities have teamed up to launch the Texas Stock Exchange, set to start trading early next year. Just last month, the Nasdaq announced that it will open a new regional headquarters in Dallas. The danger isn’t necessarily that the leading lights of the world’s capital markets are all going to decamp from New York for good. It’s more that they’ll keep a trophy office and smaller staff in the city as a meeting hub — but locate most of their operations and workforce elsewhere. In these other cities, lower housing and living costs allow firms to pay employees less, even as they still take home more at the end of the week. If the national economy slows, these savings will look even more appealing. Meanwhile, many of New York City’s expenses are fixed — and thus depend on a growing local economy.

If your 401(k) balance has made you uneasy lately, just think: The city has to make good on pension promises to some 750,000 current and retired employees. When a stock-market decline doesn’t allow the city’s pension funds to hit their target 7% annual growth rate, Gotham’s taxpayers are on the hook for the difference. The city’s bloated $116 billion FY 2026 budget won’t pay for itself, especially with the Trump administration’s cuts to federal funding. It’s time for Mayor Eric Adams to batten down the hatches and ramp up emergency budget measures until the storm clouds clear. He can start by declaring a hiring freeze across agencies for non-uniformed positions —the opposite of his new proposal to hire 3,700 more city teachers. Instead, he should close failing schools, merge under-enrolled ones, and decrease school-level funding in proportion to enrollment declines. Adding to the city’s $2 billion rainy-day fund — while he still can — would further cushion the blow of a potential recession. The savings account currently amounts to only 1.7% of the annual budget, and hasn’t been growing sufficiently. Adams should freeze spending related to Local Law 97, the de Blasio-era law that mandates big carbon cuts across city operations. Halting these efforts could save up to $2 billion a year. Meanwhile, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development plans to spend at least $700 million annually over the next decade on new low-income housing construction: Trimming this back — and instead allowing the private sector to build more housing without public subsidies — would reduce the city’s debt load and annual interest payments. Spending less money is rarely popular, but Adams shouldn’t wait for a budget crunch before doing the responsible thing. Strong fiscal leadership could even help him stand out among his competitors in November’s general election. After all, when the waters get choppy, a steady hand at the wheel keeps the ship on course. John Ketcham is director of cities and a legal policy fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Title: Our Recession Defense Plan: Giant Monthly Dividends

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Monthly salary. On time money loan payment concept. Vector illustration isolated. Although some tariff hikes have been paused, a recession is still very much in play. Just a few days ago, I wrote that “this is the time to recession-proof our retirement holdings.” And why not? GDP estimates have tanked. So has consumer sentiment. Goldman Sachs made headlines for raising its probability of recession (from 20% to 35%). Fine, but equity analysts often get caught up in crowds. What was more striking was hearing a similar message from the debt watchers. Consider this post from Mark Zandi, Moody’s Analytics’ chief economist: Mark Zandi Recession Tweet In my previous post, I showed readers how to recession-proof their portfolio with municipal debt. But tax-advantaged munis aren’t the only way to hunker down for the worst. A variety of debt would benefit if Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s campaign to flatten long rates is successful. And we can get the most bang for our buck via closed-end funds, which not only deliver much more yield—like the 8.9%-10.7% paydays I’ll highlight today—than comparable exchange-traded funds, but can trade at a discount to their net asset value (NAV), meaning we can buy those bonds for less than they’re actually worth. For instance: Western Asset Inflation-Linked Opportunities & Income Fund (WIW)Distribution Rate: 8.9% The Western Asset Inflation-Linked Opportunities & Income Fund (WIW) is an intriguing play if only because the current situation is so unique. The majority of WIW’s holdings (80%+) are inflation-linked securities, largely Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). The rest of its assets are sprinkled around investment-grade corporates, emerging-market bonds, non-agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and other debt. The resulting portfolio is extremely high in credit quality. The play here seems contradictory at first. Trump’s tariffs, if they hold, are widely expected to juice inflation, for obvious reasons. Research houses have been raising their CPI and PCE estimates left and right over the past few days. But if inflation gets out of control, the Federal Reserve would swoop in and hike rates to try to quell rising prices like it has in the past, right? And if so, wouldn’t that keep bonds grounded? Possibly. But between federal-government purges and the potential for a lot of short-term tariff pain here at home, unemployment estimates are also going up. And while higher joblessness would weigh on inflation somewhat, it could also stay the Fed’s hand and put downward pressure on long-term rates. In short: Stagflation (high inflation + slow economic growth) is actually a win-win situation for TIPS, and thus a win-win for WIW. And we can expect to get more out of WIW than a plain-vanilla ETF in a TIPS-friendly environment. That’s largely because of 30% debt leverage, which is an elevated amount that lets management go full-throttle on its highest-conviction picks. That same leverage is how WIW gets 9% monthly dividends out of such highly rated holdings. Western Asset’s fund trades at an 11% discount to its NAV, so we’re getting its holdings for 89 cents on the dollar. That’s good—it would be great, but WIW has averaged a 12% discount over the past five years. Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (JPC)Distribution Rate: 10.7% Few debt CEFs will get anywhere close to WIW’s portfolio quality, but we shouldn’t look down our noses at Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (JPC), which also manages to squeeze a stellar yield out of a sterling portfolio. As the name would suggest, Nuveen’s CEF is a preferred-stock fund. Preferreds technically aren’t debt, but they share a lot of the same characteristics. So they’re bond proxies, and they too can thrive should we get lower long-term rates. JPC specifically holds roughly 280 preferreds with a heavy overseas bent—currently, the portfolio is split 55/45 domestic/international. But the companies behind the preferreds are exactly what we’d expect from a preferred fund: Financial firms such as Barclays (BCS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) make up the lion’s share of assets. Credit quality is also much better than other funds in JPC’s category. With JPC, we’re getting both the benefit of human managers (who can target underpriced opportunities) and an even loftier amount of leverage, at 39%. The result is, like WIW, a juiced-up version of a plain-vanilla index ETF: JPC Returns But look at that nasty dip at the far right. That’s worse than a lot of bond funds, in part because preferred stocks—while “preferred” compared to common equity—aren’t as secure as true debt. Extreme fright in the equity markets can weigh on preferreds, too, which makes timing all the more important. Right now, JPC is trading at a roughly 2% discount to NAV versus a five-year average of 5%. We’re getting a bargain on this double-digit monthly dividend, and we could be suffering additional short-term headaches, too. BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ)Distribution Rate: 10.1% I highlighted a BlackRock muni fund a few days ago, but it’s not the only BlackRock product that’s worth a look in this environment. The BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ) is a multisector bond fund whose managers have a true “go anywhere” mentality. Right now, shares of BTZ give us exposure to investment-grade corporates (40%), junk (35%), developed sovereigns (17%), securitized products (11%), small amounts of bank loans and emerging-market debt, even a trace of equity. The sizable chunk of high-yield debt means credit isn’t stellar—in fact, on average (BBB-), it’s about a step lower than the average multisector bond fund’s credit (BBB). We get the same combination of opportunistic management and high (35%) leverage as we do with the other funds. The downswings are still violent, but the outperformance is massive. In other words, while we still want to buy at ideal prices, the pressure isn’t as great for us to jump into BTZ at exactly the right moment. A 8% discount to NAV versus a 6% five-year average is nothing to sneeze at. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

In 2025’s first quarter, we’ve seen a big shift in crypto’s power dynamics. It’s not just about cool tech or chasing quick profits anymore. Now, it’s also about power – political power and Wall Street money. At the same time, financial giants like BlackRock say their big-picture investment trends – or ‘mega trends’ – still include crypto. It’s clear: politics and big finance are getting seriously involved. And that changes the game. Some new altcoins are stepping up, perfectly positioned to ride this wave of influence and money. Here are three of the best crypto presales right now that could take off as institutions and politicians pour into the space: Crypto’s no longer hanging out on the fringes – it’s being invited into the halls of power. The Trump family is stepping deeper into crypto in 2025. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have launched American Bitcoin with mining firm Hut 8, aiming to build a major U.S. Bitcoin reserve. At the same time, they’re backing a stablecoin called USD1 through World Liberty Financial – a dollar-pegged token designed for global payments. With moves in both mining and stablecoins, the Trumps are shifting from crypto supporters to key players in its next institutional chapter. Meanwhile, over on Wall Street, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink says the same ‘mega trends’ that drove massive institutional interest in crypto are still going strong – even as the U.S. economy reorients itself. The message? Big money and big politics are all in. And for everyday investors watching from the sidelines, a few new crypto projects are already gearing up to ride this wave. Bitcoin is gunning for $1M, and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is riding shotgun. This meme-powered, community-driven token is built for one mission: help regular folks catch a piece of Bitcoin’s rocket ride – with a little extra kick. It’s priced at just $0.00246 and has already raised over $4.6M in presale. But what really sets it apart? Real Bitcoin rewards. That’s right – $BTCBULL is the only meme coin that automatically pays holders actual $BTC every time Bitcoin smashes through a major price milestone like $150K, $200K. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more $BTC and $BTCBULL you can earn. And with each new milestone, part of the $BTCBULL supply gets burned, making your tokens more scarce and potentially more valuable. It also integrates with Best Wallet, so you can skip the headache of setting up complicated Bitcoin wallets. Just hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet, and get rewarded. In a world where most meme coins are all bark and no bite, $BTCBULL is bringing real rewards to the table – and it’s doing it with style, memes, and a whole lot of bullish energy. As crypto goes institutional – with politicians launching mining ops and Wall Street chasing “mega trends” – retail users need better tools to stay ahead. That’s where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) steps in. It’s more than just a presale play – it’s a utility token designed to keep you in the driver’s seat as crypto evolves. Priced at $0.0247, with over $11.6M raised in presale, $BEST is powering the rapid growth of Best Wallet – a next-gen crypto wallet that’s taking direct aim at outdated players like MetaMask. When you buy $BEST, you get real-world perks: reduced transaction fees, early access to new token launches, boosted staking rewards, and even exclusive bonuses through iGaming partners, including free spins and loot boxes. With over 60K followers on X, 50% monthly user growth, and ambitions to claim 40% of the wallet market by 2026, $BEST is gunning for top spot among utility tokens. In a world where big players are taking over, $BEST is your front-row seat – and your power-up – in crypto’s next great shift. In a crypto world split across dozens of blockchains, Qubetics ($TICS) is building the bridges – and then some. Currently priced at $0.1573, Qubetics has already raised over $16M in presale with 24,6K backers already on board. But this isn’t just another multichain protocol. Qubetics combines DeFi tools, a built-in multichain wallet, and even a decentralized VPN (dVPN) to keep users’ activity private and secure – a rare combo in today’s market. Plus, Qubetics AI agent enhances everything from transaction routing to yield optimization, making the platform smarter as it grows. In a year where institutions and regulators are tightening the screws, $TICS gives users a futureproof way to stay connected without getting boxed in. As the crypto space continues to intertwine with political and institutional spheres, tokens like $BTCBULL, $BEST, and $TICS stand out for their strategic positioning and innovative solutions. Investors seeking to navigate this new era of crypto would do well to consider these projects, each offering unique avenues to engage with the market’s evolving dynamics.​ Don’t forget to DYOR (do your own research) before investing, as this article is for informational purposes only and doesn’t constitute financial advice.

This post was originally published on April 13 Donald Trump’s escalating global trade war has pushed markets to the brink this week, causing a spiralling U.S. dollar "confidence crisis" amid fears of "collapse." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The Federal Reserve, which stepped in to calm markets during the Covid panic, is closely watching the $29 trillion Treasury market for signs convulsions caused by Trump’s tariffs could turn into a full-blown financial crisis (while Wall Street braces for a looming “existential” threat). Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise prediction, a top Federal Reserve official has said it “would absolutely be prepared" to step in to rescue markets if U.S. president Trump’s trade war threatens the financial system. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has triggered chaos on financial markets with his on-again, off-again ... More trade war, tanking stock markets and sending the bitcoin price and crypto markets on a rollercoaster. “We have had to deploy quite quickly, various tools,” Susan Collins, head of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times, referring to previous times the Fed has moved to calm chaotic markets at times of low liquidity or market malfunctions. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” However, Collins, who fears Trump’s tariff trade war could send inflation back above 3% in 2025, said that currently “markets are continuing to function well” and that “we’re not seeing liquidity concerns overall," adding the Fed “does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise.” 04/14 update: JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced to step in and bail out the near-$30 trillion U.S. Treasury market following U.S. president Donald Trump’s campaign of rapid-fire global tariffs. “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations,” Dimon said in a Friday earnings call, warning that the Fed won’t act until “they start to panic a little bit." Dimon suggested the Fed could ditch a rule that exempts Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, something that would allow institutional investors to buy more bonds without breaking capital requirement rules. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The suggestion has been seized on as bullish by Bitmex cofounder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes, who posted to X that: “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.” "[Supplementary leverage ratio] exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital," Hayes added. Earlier this month, traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars—though Collins said emergency rate cuts would not be the Fed’s primary tool for responding to market’s failing. In 2020, ahead of one of the largest ever stock market rallies that saw the bitcoin price and crypto market surge to never-before-seen heights, the Fed restarted its 2008 financial crisis-era programs of quantitative easing while cutting rates to near-zero and scrapping its cap on the number of Treasuries it could buy—fueling expectations the Fed could again turbo charge the bitcoin price. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. Collins’ comments come as the New York Fed’s John Williams has warned that Trump’s tariffs could send inflation spiralling, caused a wave of unemployment and damage U.S. economic growth. This coming week, Fed chair Jerome Powell, who is at loggerheads with Trump over the need for interest rate cuts, is due to speak at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday in what will be a closely-watched speech. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set ahead of Donald ... More Trump's inauguration as global markets convulse over Trump's trade tariffs. Trump’s fast-moving approach to tariffs and trade negotiation—that’s seen China hit with levies of almost 150% before a carve out was announced for smartphones, computers and some other electronics—has seen the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jump 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% over the past week, spooking markets with its outsized swings. Crypto and stock markets have been on a rollercoaster that’s caused some of the most extreme volatility ever seen. After Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs, the S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever following a steep multi-trillion dollar sell-off. The notoriously volatile bitcoin price and crypto market has swung from highs of $3 trillion late March to lows of $2.5 trillion in early April before rebounding back toward $3 trillion. Meanwhile, business leaders on Wall Street and across the U.S. are warning the economy is buckling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned the U.S. may already be in a recession due to Trump’s sweeping tariffs while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon has said recession is the “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade war.
