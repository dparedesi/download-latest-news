Insurance giant Allianz has sponsored the GAA National Leagues since 1993. Photo: Sportsfile Madam — Offaly GAA and, more recently, Roscommon GAA have submitted motions seeking to end all commercial involvement with Allianz. Several other counties, including Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone, have also passed motions urging the GAA to cease its commercial relationship with the insurance company. These developments reflect a growing movement driven by concerns over Allianz’s financial links to Israel, which has prompted a review by the GAA’s Ethics and Integrity Commission. Last March, the Institute for Palestine Studies released a report highlighting major insurance companies’ links to firms operating in Israel. The top insurers named — Allianz, Aviva, Axa, Zurich Insurance Group and RSA (Intact) — collectively channelled an estimated $1.7bn (€1.46bn) into 15 companies associated with Israeli activities. The report underscores a truth many may prefer to ignore: the world has changed so profoundly that it is virtu­ally impossible to find a multinational enterprise untouched by global geopolitical connections, including those involving Israel. If we choose to boycott these companies while simultaneously insuring our homes, cars and livelihoods through the same underwriters, and then demand that the GAA sever ties with them, are we not facing a deep contradiction? Is this not a form of self-sabotage, a gesture that makes us feel righteous while achieving nothing of substance? Ireland has zero influence over the outcome of a jihadist conflict in the Middle East. We were not at the negotiating table. We were not invited to the peace talks. Our diplomatic weight in this matter is, at best, symbolic. Given this reality, are we truly prepared to cancel our life assurance, pensions and motor and home insurance in a grand attempt to force geopolitical change? Are we genuinely that principled, or merely selectively outraged? Before we risk shooting ourselves in the foot, we must ask who exactly is driving this agenda. Allianz has been a committed sponsor of the GAA for over three decades, supporting clubs and communities in every county. Who benefits from pushing the GAA, its clubs, managers and players into a political theatre where they do not belong? Our athletes should not be distracted by global entanglements far beyond their control. They should be allowed to focus on what unites us — the joy, community and pass­ion of Gaelic football. That is where the heart of the GAA truly lies, and where it should remain. Dan Finn, Strokestown, Co Roscommon Madam — Paul Kearns cites “a report being compiled by the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland (JRCI) that details a significant rise in antisemitic incidents” (‘Swastikas in the classroom: the rise of antisemitism in Ireland’, November 30). He fails to specify what proportion of these incidents related to the state of ­Israel and not to Jews in general, a ­necessary clarification in view of the ­JRCI’s tendency to equate ­anti-Zionism with ­antisemitism. Boasting of having been “fiercely critical of the [current] Israeli government’s actions in Gaza”, Mr Kearns rejects ­descriptions of Israel as “a ­genocidal state”. However, the disenfranchisement, ethnic cleansing and “incremental genocide” (Israeli historian Ilan Pappe’s term) of Palestinians did not begin with the present government. Israel’s foundation in 1948 coincided with the Palestinian nakba, when 400 Arab-­majority villages and towns were depop­ulated. At least 750,000 Palestinians were ­expelled from their homes and denied their inalien­able right of return, which is guaranteed under international law. Mr Kearns might ponder the words of the Israeli-born author and essayist Avi Steinberg, who renounced his citizenship last year because, he said, “citizenship, of the kind I hold, has been a material piece of a long-standing genocidal ­process. The Israeli state, from its inception, has relied on the normalisation of ethnically determined supremacist laws to bolster a military regime whose clear colonial goal is the elimination of Palestine”. If Ireland is noting a rise in antisemitism, Mr Kearns should not use this to exonerate an outlaw state and to ­disparage its critics. Raymond Deane, Broadstone, Dublin 7 Madam — Paul Kearns lists the “discomforts” of antisemitism in Ireland, with Jewish people being “scared” and “afraid” and children not getting birthday party invitations. Let’s compare these “discomforts” to those of the Palestinian people: since October, 2023, the Israeli military has killed 21,263 children. None of them will ever attend a birthday parties. Tom Harper, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — The testimonies of Jewish people in Ireland quoted by Paul Kearns are disturbing. A society in which swastikas keep reappearing even after they are scrubbed off has a deeper problem than graffiti. When political tribes polarise around foreign conflicts, they import the rhetoric wholesale and apply it to neighbours who have nothing to do with the battlefield. Ireland risks drifting into that trap. The trouble with importing other people’s ­hatreds is that they often refuse to leave. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — To learn that Dublin city councillors even sugg­ested renaming Herzog Park because of its Jewish heritage is a step too far. Have they no shame? What sort of message does this send to the world? Thank you, Micheál Martin, for standing up to the councillors who, in endorsing this proposal, have shown ­ignorance and a lack of respect towards Irish Jewish ­people. Úna Heaton, Co Limerick Madam — Last Saturday, I raised the Palestinian flag on a building I own in ­Listowel to signal my support for the International Day of ­Solidarity with the Palestinian People. Meanwhile, more than 470 staff at Beaumont Hospital and 250 medical consultants across the State have backed a boycott of Teva Pharmaceuticals, an Israeli company that is a major drug supplier to the HSE. Five GAA county boards have passed motions against Allianz sponsorship because of that company’s links with Israel. Sally Rooney has said she will continue to use proceeds from her works to support Palestine Action, a proscribed organisation in the UK, even if the sale of her books could be outlawed. Rooney, along with Bob ­Vylan, Kneecap, Liam Cunningham, Naoise Dolan and others, are doing what our political leaders and some sycophants in the press are unwilling or afraid to face up to. Yet Eilis O’Hanlon says if Sinn Féin wants to be taken seriously as a party of government it “needs to grow up and start acting like one” (‘Sinn Féin has the political personality of a stroppy student’, November 30). With all due respect to your columnist, she is way behind the curve on this one. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Full marks to RTÉ and the other national broadcasters that have decided to boycott next year’s Eurovision Song Contest because of Israel’s participation. I hope the Irish Government will follow RTÉs principled action and stop stalling over the Occupied Territories Bill. Breasal Ó Caollaí, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Madam — By boycotting Eurovision, RTÉ is exceeding its legislative authority. Its all-out political stance on Israel participating in a song contest is far beyond its role. RTÉ is a public service broadcasting monopoly and it is incumbent upon it to provide unbiased and impartial journ­alism and coverage. That has gone completely out the window with the Eurovision. Maurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork Madam —Peter Vandermeersch was so right about Donald Trump (‘Journalists must always challenge Trump’s cynical shrug in the face of evil’, November 23), and the response by your reader Paul Byrne was also totally correct (Letters, November 30). The US is a huge country in every way. Every other nation is ­required to pay close attention to what is happening there. Nowadays, it has gone beyond that. We now see national leaders as supplicants, metaphorically on their knees to stay in favour with the US president. His personality requires ­constant praise. If democratic leaders demur, he will get it from despots and autocrats and will overlook their behaviour, no matter how egregious. Anthony Hanrahan, Salruck, Renvyle, Co Galway Madam — Colin Murphy laments the “growing gap between citizens and their political representatives (‘MetroLink showdown exposes the missing connection in our public life’, November 30). He should take account of the Constitution, which refers to separation of powers within our democratic structures: the Government legislates and the courts adjudicate. Would he prefer Ireland did away with this to follow the example of autocratic and authoritarian states? Sean Darcy, Celbridge, Co Kildare Madam — Willie O’Dea’s column (‘Defence Forces’ decline is a global embarrassment that must be reversed’, November 30) brought a wry smile. Better that, I decided, than a fluster of frustration at my time of life. First, as this article related to the Defence Forces and nat­ional defence issues, it should have been stated that Mr O’Dea is a former defence minister (September 2004 to February 2010). He is among a long line of ministers who have left the Def­ence Forces, “by increments”, to use his phrase, with a weakened and limited capacity in a world where the rule of law is constantly being diminished. It is regrettable that Mr O’Dea, rather than being infam­ously remembered for being photographed in November 2005 jokingly aiming a pistol at a press photographer, didn’t bring some of his current thinking to the cabinet table some years ago. He could have helped to rev­erse the decline of the Defence Forces, which was obvious at the beginning of the millenni­um and during his time as minister. Michael Gannon (Defence Forces, retired), St Thomas Square, Kilkenny Madam — Reading Willie O’Dea’s article on the weakening of the Defence Forces, I must agree with his sentiments. If the problem isn’t add­ressed, we could find ourselves staring down the barrel of a gun. Sorry, Willie. Noel Kelly, Doonbeg, Co Clare Madam — Roslyn Dee’s article (‘Trespasses brought back the division, violence and killing of my homeplace’, People & Culture, November 30) took me back to May 17, 1974. I refer, of course, to the Dublin bombings. I was working in a shop on Capel Street and at close of business, as a colleague and I left, we heard a dreadful muffled boom, the site of the atrocity being but a 15-minute walk from where we stood. To this day, I can clearly hear my colleague say: “Jesus, Tom, that sounds like a bomb.” We hastened to my Austin Mini and headed off up Dorset Street as fast as the traffic allowed. Thankfully, I did not lose a relative or friend that day, but later learned that a gentleman who worked for the same company suffered the heartbreaking loss of his daughter. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Madam — “Beannachtaí an tSéasúir” said no one ever ­(‘Furore over festive lights name can’t dim my love of winter’, ­November 30). This “blessing” may exist in the imagination or the vast vault of Naoise Dolan’s wishful thinking, but it’s not real. Among Irish language speakers, you will sometimes hear “Beannachtaí na ­Nollag”. This too, is not top-drawer Irish, but at least it is in popular use. P Kelly, Carraroe, Co Galway Madam — With the departure of Paschal Donohoe and before him Michael McGrath, there have been many commentators bemoaning the loss of these two highly rated ministers. I would humbly suggest using the ­Seanad to attract more talent into national politics. Every political party and Dáil grouping could create a list of people with specialist expertise along the lines of Seanad election panels, such as agriculture. The election of people from this list would be based on the overall percentage that a party or ­Independents as a whole ­received in a general election. Inclusion on the list would be based on regional caucuses and votes by party members or registered independent citizens. This could attract the kind of people we need to scrutinise and improve legislation and give ­citizens a real involvement in the make-up of the Seanad. I believe this or a form of a list system could offer the Seanad far greater relevance. Criostoir McGrath, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — The UK’s National Energy System ­Operator has ­reported “an emerging risk to gas supply security from 2030 to 2036”. By the 2030s, we will be nearly wholly reliant on the UK for natural gas. In this context, Eoin O’Malley’s column (‘Reaction will be harsh, but it’s time our energy went nuclear’, November 30) was a timely reminder that we need a contingency power source. Is the Government being reckless by not putting in place an energy strategy that includes nuclear? Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Shane Ross admits Simon Harris was a good councillor and a diligent TD, then resorts to the same old criticism (‘How Harris can escape last-chance saloon’, November 30). I wonder what Mr Ross was like as a TD, but can draw my own conclusions from the fact the voters of Dublin Rathdown dismissed him at the 2020 general election. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo

Title: Bitcoin enters extreme volatility – Why institutions refuse to back down

Full Content:
Heavyweights under pressure: Why institutional moves are key for BTC. The crypto market is swinging hard between fear and extreme fear. December came in hot, with Bitcoin [BTC] ripping +8%. However, the momentum rolled over almost instantly. Now HODLers are trying to figure out whether this is just a liquidity sweep or the start of a deeper trend breakdown. Bulls completely lost the $90k support block, which basically shows how thin BTC‘s bid side is right now. And the volatility is echoed in BTC ETF flows, showing no sustained inflow trend, no real directional conviction. Source: SoSo Value Notably, this is where the real divergence kicks in. In previous accumulation phases, BTC pullbacks were backed by solid ETF demand. As the chart shows, daily net inflows usually started around $500 million and eventually ramped to $1 billion as BTC pushed toward the top. But this cycle is a different story. Daily net flows are sitting at just $54.8 million, which signals how weak the current demand side really is. Given this setup, how are institutions positioning themselves to stay resilient? Recent market FUD hasn’t spared Bitcoin’s heavyweight holders. MicroStrategy [MSTR] is the standout example here. Ever since it lost the $450 level back in mid-July, the stock has been stuck in a steady downtrend. At press time, MSTR was trading around $178. Notably, MSTR isn’t the only one under pressure. BlackRock has unloaded 26k BTC since October, marking its most aggressive sell phase on record. In short, the recent FUD has put a strong share of institutions under stress. Source: TradingView (MSTR/USD) The result? Bitcoin HODLers are basically stuck in indecision. In this setup, the billions flowing out of BTC ETFs aren’t random. With weak bid support, slipping stock performance, and broad FUD, investors are clearly sitting on the sidelines instead of backing Bitcoin heavyweights. The logic is simple: Unlike private HODLers, public firms feel the pressure much harder. As these BTC-heavy companies keep bleeding capital, the risk of a wider sell-off can’t be ignored. That’s why tracking their moves is critical. As volatility ramps up, all eyes are on the big leagues. But recent moves suggest BTC heavyweights might be weathering the market chop more smoothly than many expect. Case in point: The National Bank of Canada just made a big splash. In a strategic move, the $398 billion institution scooped up 1.47 million shares of MSTR, worth about $273 million, boosting its BTC treasury exposure and showing confidence in navigating the turbulent market. Source: SoSo Value Notably, BlackRock isn’t far behind. A prominent analyst recently highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT generated $245 million in revenue despite $2.7 billion in outflows over five weeks, clearly showing how the firm is capitalizing on market swings. Why does this matter? Sustained revenue lets BlackRock keep scaling positions. In short, despite the Bitcoin crash, its heavyweights are strategizing, showing they are navigating Bitcoin volatility strategically.

Title: Citadel pushes SEC to classify open-source developers as unregistered stockbrokers – Uniswap fires back

Citadel's Dec. 2 filing urges the SEC not to grant broad exemptions for tokenized-equity trading on DeFi, Hayden Adams says TradFi is coming for open-source builders. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Dec. 2, Citadel Securities filed a 13-page letter with the SEC arguing that decentralized protocols facilitating tokenized US equity trading already meet statutory definitions of exchanges and broker-dealers, and regulators should treat them accordingly. Two days later, the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee convened a panel on tokenized equities that made clear the question is no longer whether stocks can move on-chain, but whether they can do so without dismantling the permissionless architecture that built DeFi. The gap between those two positions now defines the most consequential regulatory fight in crypto since the Howey test debates. Citadel’s letter arrived at the moment when tokenized equities stopped being a thought experiment. The firm welcomes tokenization in principle but insists that realizing its benefits requires applying “the key bedrock principles and investor protections that underpin the fairness, efficiency, and resiliency of US equity markets.” In other words, the document suggests that companies seeking to trade tokenized Apple shares must comply with Nasdaq rules, including transparent fees, consolidated tape reporting, market surveillance, fair access, and registration as an exchange or broker-dealer. The filing warns that granting broad exemptive relief to DeFi platforms creates a shadow US equity market in which liquidity fragments, retail investors lose Exchange Act protections, and incumbents face regulatory arbitrage from unregistered competitors. Within hours, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams fired back on X, calling Citadel’s position an attempt to “treat software developers of decentralized protocols like centralized intermediaries.” He invoked ConstitutionDAO, the 2021 crowdfunding effort that pooled $47 million in Ethereum to bid on a first-edition Constitution at Sotheby’s, only to lose to Griffin’s $43.2 million bid. Additionally, Adams zeroed in on Citadel’s fair-access argument, calling it “actual nerve” from the dominant player in retail order flow. The exchange captured crypto’s core narrative of permissionless code versus gatekeeper control and set the terms for the Dec. 4 panel. Citadel walks through the Exchange Act’s definitions to make its case. An exchange is “any organization, association, or group of persons” that “provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities.” Rule 3b-16 clarifies that a system operates as an exchange if it brings together orders using established, non-discretionary methods and if buyers and sellers agree to trade. Citadel argues many DeFi protocols meet all three prongs: there is a “group of persons” behind the protocol (founding designers, governance organizations, foundations), the protocol brings together buyers and sellers via non-discretionary code (automated market makers, on-chain order books), and users agree to trade when they submit transactions. The same logic extends to broker-dealer status. Citadel catalogs DeFi trading apps, wallet providers, AMMs, liquidity providers, searchers, validators, protocol developers, and smart contract developers. For each, it lists transaction-based fees, governance-token rewards, or order-routing payments. The implication is that protocols that collect revenue tied to securities trading, even through code, must register. That framing aligns with the SEC’s 2024 enforcement action against Rari Capital, which charged a DeFi lending protocol and its founders with acting as unregistered brokers. Citadel wants Rari to serve as the template. The fair access requirement became the flashpoint. Exchanges and ATSs must apply objective criteria to all users, removing discrimination in who can trade and the fees they pay. Citadel’s letter notes that there are “no equivalent requirements for unregistered DeFi trading systems, enabling them to limit access arbitrarily or preference certain members over others.” Adams chose that paragraph for his screenshot, arguing that Citadel cannot credibly claim DeFi lacks fair access when the firm itself dominates retail order flow from brokers like Robinhood. Armani Ferrante, founder of Backpack, added: “‘DeFi’ is not well defined and so all of these conversations are an apples to oranges comparisons. There’s CEXs. Unregulated CEXs. DEXs. And unregulated CEXs pretending to be DEXs.” The SEC Investor Advisory Committee meeting framed tokenized equities within a mainstream market structure rather than treating them as a crypto novelty. The panel, moderated by Andrew Park and John Gulliver, brought together representatives from Coinbase, BlackRock, Robinhood, Nasdaq, Citadel Securities, and Galaxy Digital. The agenda tested how issuance, trading, clearing, settlement, and investor protections could work under existing rules, with an explicit focus on native issuance versus wrapper models, Regulation NMS applicability, interoperability across chains, and settlement and short-selling mechanics. Commissioner Crenshaw delivered the skeptical case. She noted that many tokenized equity products marketed as wrapped exposure are not one-to-one replicas of the underlying shares, with ownership rights and entitlements that can be unclear or disconnected from issuers. Additionally, she questioned whether relaxing requirements simply because a product sits on a blockchain invites regulatory arbitrage. That framing dovetails with the agenda’s emphasis on distinguishing true equity-like rights from lookalike tokens. Chairman Paul Atkins countered by pitching tokenization as a modernization project for US capital markets, arguing the Commission should enable markets to move on-chain while keeping US leadership in global finance. Outside the meeting, incumbent resistance sharpened. The World Federation of Exchanges warned the SEC against broad relief that would let crypto firms sell tokenized stocks without the traditional regulatory perimeter. SIFMA echoed a technology-neutral line, supporting innovation but arguing that tokenized securities should remain subject to core investor-protection and market-integrity rules and that any exemptions should be narrow. Nasdaq’s earlier proposal to treat qualifying tokenized shares as fungible with traditional shares on the same order book, with the same CUSIP and the same material rights, aligns with the direction Atkins appears to favor. Citadel’s theory holds that a security is a security, regardless of the ledger. If you bring together buyers and sellers of Apple shares, even tokenized, using automated code and collecting fees, you perform exchange or broker-dealer functions and should meet those obligations. This view treats code as infrastructure, not ideology. It assumes that investor protection flows from intermediary accountability rather than from technical design. Adams’s theory treats open-source code as distinct from intermediaries. A smart contract does not have customers, does not take custody, does not exercise discretion, and does not fit the Exchange Act’s mid-20th-century model. Treating protocol developers as brokers conflates writing software with operating a business and hands incumbents veto power over which technologies can exist. This view assumes protection flows from transparency and permissionlessness: anyone can audit the code, fork it, or build competing infrastructure. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, has staked out a position closer to Adams. In a February statement, she stated that ordinary DeFi front-end builders and open-source developers should not automatically be held to exchange and broker standards just for publishing code or running a non-custodial UI. Yet Citadel’s letter explicitly lists “DeFi protocol developers” and “smart contract developers” as potential intermediaries who design, deploy, and maintain infrastructure while collecting fees for executing trades, exercising governance rights, and prioritizing network traffic. If deploying a smart contract that lets users trade tokenized stocks makes someone a broker-dealer subject to net-capital rules, custody requirements, and know-your-customer obligations, then open-source protocol development becomes legally untenable. The signal for 2026 is that the SEC will test whether tokenized equities can exist inside the same investor-rights and market-integrity architecture that governs today’s equities. Atkins has floated an innovation exemption, a supervised sandbox that would let some tokenized equity platforms operate without full registration while the agency studies the risks. The Dec. 4 panel framed that exemption as a compliance stress test, not a blanket waiver. The big unresolved fight is whether innovation pathways will be tightly tethered to Regulation NMS and existing intermediary obligations, or whether the SEC will entertain broader experimental carve-outs that TradFi groups fear could fragment liquidity and weaken protections. If the SEC sides with Citadel, DeFi protocols handling tokenized equities face compliance burdens designed for Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, driving activity offshore or into gray-market wrappers. If it sides with Adams, traditional participants will argue that the agency created regulatory arbitrage, and litigation from SIFMA and the World Federation of Exchanges will follow. The outcome decides whether tokenized US equities can trade on public blockchains under the permissionless ethos that built DeFi, or whether opening the stock market to on-chain settlement means closing DeFi’s open architecture in America.

Title: VUSLAT BAYOGLU | Follow the money, not Trump & Co
URL: https://www.sundaytimes.timeslive.co.za/business/news/2025-12-06-follow-the-money-not-trump-co/
Time Published: 2025-12-06T18:00:25Z
Full Content:
The year 2025 began with two important developments that tell a story about the complex relationships — political and commercial — between the US and South Africa. Donald Trump was inaugurated on January 20. Three days later, Coca-Cola, America’s largest soft drink multinational, and South African Rugby announced an investment in the form of sponsorship for the Springboks. Coincidentally, the four-year deal corresponds with Trump’s presidential four-year term. Since his inauguration, Trump has earned a reputation in South Africa as a racially divisive figure who lies about white genocide. He even invented an exclusive refugee programme for the imaginary “victims”. On the other hand, by striking a partnership with the Springboks, Coca-Cola has taken a positive stand not only about South Africa but about its own corporate aspirations. It sees immense value in associating with our world rugby champions, who are the symbol of the country’s rich talents, pooled from diverse communities. The Springboks bust the myth of racial intolerance and genocide that Trump and his South African right-wing supporters are peddling. They symbolise national unity. Trump’s attempt to undermine South Africa is in sharp contrast to the enthusiasm expressed by Coca-Cola and other US multinationals that have shown confidence in South Africa. BlackRock, the largest US investment firm, now holds the biggest share of Eskom’s foreign bonds. US retail giant Walmart has begun rolling out stores in South Africa, having acquired wholesale group Massmart a few years ago. It has stated that it seeks to champion “inclusive growth”. The big US banks are also rooting for South Africa with their money. Citigroup has increased its stake in Absa to 5%. Goldman Sachs, which held an investment conference in South Africa, has increased its client base. While Trump talks and acts negatively, even going as far as withdrawing his administration from the G20 summit, US companies act positively. The country’s corporate diplomacy differs sharply from Trump’s arbitrary politics And automaker Ford is expanding its production line in Pretoria. These and other US companies are led by smart leaders who see mutually beneficial value in South Africa. They are not saying we are perfect. No country is. While Trump talks and acts negatively, even going as far as withdrawing his administration from the G20 summit, US companies act positively. The country’s corporate diplomacy differs sharply from Trump’s arbitrary politics. Trump is not alone in his misguided views. He is in the company of a small but loud group of white Afrikaners who moan about the democratic dispensation while displaying unashamed apartheid nostalgia. They refuse to acknowledge that the political deal that Nelson Mandela and the ANC struck with their apartheid-era oppressors protects property rights, including land ownership. Expropriation for various legitimate purposes is a tried and tested method of acquiring land all over the world, including in the US. In South Africa, we have the advantage of an independent judiciary to adjudicate disputes that may arise regarding the quantum of compensation. It’s ironic that AfriForum and Solidarity would choose to lobby Trump’s America to take a stance against South Africa by spreading lies about land expropriation as if it were some random thing that can be done outside judicial review. There has never been arbitrary expropriation in South Africa, and it’s not about to happen. The right-wing groups even went to the extent of erecting banners for G20 visitors to see, claiming that South Africa was governed by race-based policies. Instead of blaming the apartheid regime for saddling democratic South Africa with racial imbalances — economic, social and access to opportunities — the right-wing lobby groups are condemning the democratic state for attempting to address the apartheid legacy. Yes, the redress mechanisms aren’t perfect. But leaving the apartheid legacy intact would be dangerous. It could fuel resentment and contribute to instability. Is this what the Right wishes? How else can we explain the glee with which it exaggerates South Africa’s problems by peddling lies and campaigning against its interests? Despite South Africa’s problems, many of which the country has the capacity to solve, it remains a relatively stable country. It is one in which US companies and others around the world can invest and get returns. Many problems persist — unemployment, crime, corruption and bureaucratic red tape. Yet they do not justify racist and unpatriotic campaigns that seek to divide rather than build. By campaigning against South Africa, and going around complaining about the mild transformation programmes of the ANC, the right-wing groups are inviting more trouble than they realise. Their campaigns could trigger the emergence of an extreme version of Julius Malema, who they despise for talking about the nationalisation of land and for occasionally singing “kill the boer”, an old song that democratic South Africa is happy to ignore in favour of fashionable amapiano, gospel and other genres. The right-wing groups must not make “kill the boer” fashionable again with their apartheid nostalgia. We must build on the constitutional foundation of nonracialism. The good thing is that US corporate leaders appear to be ignoring the right-wing groups. By cutting through the clutter of lies peddled by Trump and his fanatical supporters in South Africa, by building bridges and making objective investment cases on behalf of their clients and shareholders, US multinationals are showing the way. • Bayoglu is MD of Menar, an investment company with interests in mining and ferromanganese production Would you like to comment on this article?Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.

Title: Wall Street will be dragged to blockchain ‘kicking and screaming,’ Fidelity CEO says
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/blockchain-will-replace-scary-infrastructure-of-finance-says-fidelity-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-12-06T15:56:45Z

About us Copy link The CEO of a $15 trillion Wall Street giant just called traditional finance “really kind of scary.” Abigail Johnson, who runs Fidelity, says the current financial system is the most complicated web of basically reconciliation processes built on “primitive technology” — and that blockchain will eventually replace it. But it won’t be an easy path. “It’s got to be an evolutionary process and it’ll be some combination of competitive forces and regulatory standards that will kind of push it kicking and screaming along,” Johnson said at an A16Z crypto event on December 4. Johnson’s critique reveals how even traditional finance leaders see the current system as fundamentally broken. The industry is trapped at the “lowest common denominator” of decades-old technology, with a combination of inertia and the inability of smaller players to upgrade that’s keeping everything intact. Cue blockchain, a technology that Johnson has been betting on since 2013. But enthusiastic blockchain adoption alone won’t push the industry, according to Johnson. Instead, it will be a forced migration. For one, competitive forces means that institutions who don’t upgrade lose market share to those that do. If one bank offers instant settlement with a blockchain while competitors take three days using legacy systems, customers will move their business. If one brokerage can custody Bitcoin while another can’t, advisors and clients interested in crypto assets will go elsewhere. Fidelity, with Johnson at the helm, experienced those headwinds firsthand. The firm faced “surprisingly immature but very loud” anti-crypto sentiment from traditional finance leaders for years, Johnson said. “I just had to be patient and keep going and that the noise would pass.” Indeed, the noise has passed. In the past year, some of Wall Street’s biggest banks have begun to experiment with crypto, while digital asset treasuries and exchange-traded funds have deployed billions to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. Then there’s regulatory standards. These mean governments mandate improvements for the characteristics that blockchain enables — be it transparency, settlement speed, or interoperability. Across the world, regulation is already coming into effect. In the US, the Genius Act is already operating while the market structure bill, dubbed Clarity Act, awaits approval from the Senate, hopefully by early 2026. And in Europe, MiCA has been active since late 2024. At its core, the problem isn’t necessarily that financial institutions don’t want to upgrade. It’s that they can’t. “There’s a real kind of existential challenge for the industry because at least some of the bigger players would like to upgrade the broader infrastructure a little faster,” Johnson said. “But the industry is a democratic place and there’s a lot of small players who just don’t have the wherewithal to participate in that kind of an upgrade.” Since everything is interconnected, the weakest link determines the system’s overall capabilities. And that weakest link is stuck on decades-old technology. Fidelity has been betting on blockchain for over a decade. In 2013, the firm pioneered Bitcoin custody services for its clients, while setting up mining operations. Fidelity’s Bitcoin mining outlet, in fact, has given the firm “probably the highest single highest ROI business” Johnson said. The company’s ETF, FBTC, holds the second most Bitcoin after BlackRock, with around $20 billion in assets under management, according to Dune Analytics. Fidelity recently launched a tokenised money market fund designed to interoperate with stablecoins, allowing clients to earn yield then flip into crypto when needed. And in mid November, the firm saw its new Solana ETF debut. Still, Johnson admitted she underestimated how long the transition would take. “I didn’t fully appreciate how slow change really is in our traditional business because there’s just so many forces that keep everybody kind of together and tight doing what they’ve always been doing,” she said.

Title: Crypto Sell-Off: Binance, Coinbase, Dump Over $2 Billion In Bitcoin As Prices Dip Below $90,000
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sell-off-binance-dump-over-2-billion-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-12-06T12:00:54Z

The cryptocurrency market experienced another wave of liquidations on Friday, with Bitcoin (BTC) prices dipping below the critical support level of $90,000. This decline followed a brief rally that had seen its price rise approximately $3,000 above this threshold earlier in the week. Data from CoinGlass reveals that nearly $430 million in liquidations occurred across the crypto market over the past 24 hours, predominantly affecting leveraged long positions, which accounted for about $350 million. During this period, Bitcoin underwent a 3.5% retracement, with its price settling at just above $89,120—a stark 29% below its all-time high of over $126,000 reached in October. Market expert OxNobler recently highlighted the role of both retail and institutional investors in this downturn. In a post on social media platform X, OxNobler detailed the reason behind Bitcoin’s decline: significant sell-offs by major players. According to the analyst, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, sold 4,000 BTC; U.S.-based Coinbase (COIN) liquidated 5,675 BTC; and traditional finance giant Fidelity sold 3,288 BTC. Additionally, market maker Wintermute offloaded 1,793 BTC. Notably, the analyst pointed out that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which is the largest public company holder of Bitcoin with over 650,000 coins, has also sold over 3,820 coins in this same time frame. The firm’s sell-off comes on the heels of speculation regarding Strategy’s potential to liquidate some of its holdings due to the substantial losses affecting its financial performance amid declining Bitcoin prices. When Strategy CEO Phong Le was questioned about the possibility of selling off Bitcoin, he acknowledged that while the firm’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, has consistently opposed selling, circumstances may change if the company’s stock trades below the net value of its Bitcoin holdings, which aligns with the recent actions taken by the firm. Interestingly, while these institutional sell-offs have contributed to the current market dip, Coinbase’s institutional division has projected a potential recovery for the crypto market in December, citing improving liquidity, a 92% probability of the Federal Reserve (Fed) cutting rates, and supportive macroeconomic conditions. Analysts have pointed out several reasons for optimism, including the recovery of liquidity, the resilience of the “AI bubble,” and the attractiveness of short US dollar trades at current levels. However, OxNobler warned that the situation may not be so straightforward. Alongside the activities of major institutions, he noted that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, had recently sold $130 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Furthermore, Vitalik Buterin, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, seems to have resumed selling Ethereum, with millions of ETH being moved from the foundation’s wallet through Gnosis Safe. Ultimately, OxNobler asserts that these institutional activities may have a hand in manipulating crypto prices and preventing them from climbing to higher levels and key resistance points.

Title: Why BlackRock’s $125M Bitcoin move has BTC traders on edge

Time Published: 2025-12-06T11:00:02Z

BlackRock’s routine transfers mask bearish signals as RSI and MACD confirm short-term selling momentum dominance. The crypto market is showing strain. After failing to stay above $94,000, Bitcoin [BTC] fell 2.6% to a low of around $89,596, as of press time. At the same time, Ethereum [ETH] mirrored the move with a 3.72% drop to $3,038. This sharp correction has fueled fear among retail investors. Yet, behind the panic, institutional giants are increasing their commitments and doubling down. On the 5th of December, BlackRock deposited $125.5 million in BTC and $2.5 million in ETH to Coinbase. Analyst Ted Pillows warns that this could precede an institutional selling wave, potentially adding further instability. He said, “More selling?” And, hence, a question arises: Is the current dip a signal for deeper selling, or is it simply smart money quietly defining the new, higher floor of this ETF-driven cycle? The recent price drop, following Bitcoin’s inability to hold the $94,000 level, has inevitably focused attention on large institutional movements, specifically, BlackRock’s multi-million dollar deposit of BTC and ETH to Coinbase. In the crypto market, large transfers to exchanges are quickly seen as bearish, mainly due to liquidation risk, since they increase the supply that could be sold. With ETF outflows and macro uncertainty already heightening nerves, the market reacts sharply to such movements. So, if institutions did liquidate, the added supply could push prices lower, a fear reinforced by past cases where big deposits preceded corrections. For retail investors, seeing major funds move assets onto trading platforms often signals trouble ahead. However, this panic misses a key point: managing multi-billion-dollar ETFs often requires routine transfers that have nothing to do with imminent selling. However, a deposit alone does not automatically equate to further sales. For an ETF issuer like BlackRock, such fund movements often reflect routine operational needs, custody adjustments, redemption processing, rebalancing, or other internal workflows. BlackRock relies on Coinbase Prime for institutional custody and high‑volume trading, reflecting a systematic strategy rather than panic selling. Often, such large transfers are routine steps in ETF creation and redemption processes designed to keep prices aligned. Even so, technical indicators continue to suggest a bearish outlook in the short term. At the time of writing, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) were lying below their neutral levels, confirming the dominance of selling momentum in the short-to-medium term. Source: Trading View To decisively flip the market narrative from “bear in control” to “bullish breakout,” Bitcoin must successfully cross and hold the key resistance level at $98,000. Until then, the market remains technically subdued and vulnerable to volatility.

Title: ‘You can hear the stress in people’s voices’: St Vincent de Paul’s 900 calls for help in a single morning

A single mother with three young children is “struggling with food costs and very anxious about Christmas”. A father of four young children is “very upset” because his €244 weekly disability allowance has been cut by €80. An elderly woman who has custody of her two grandchildren has “nothing left for food” after paying her bills. These are among the stories heard on more than 900 calls for help made during a single morning this week to the St Vincent de Paul eastern region call centre in Dublin. The centre, on Sean McDermott Street in the north inner city, takes calls from counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. It will receive about 1,500 by the day’s end from households “desperately struggling and stressed”, says Sinead Gill, the information lead for the region. “We are up 7 per cent on the number of calls since last year. Nationally, there were 250,000 calls in 2024 and, as usual, we are exceptionally busy at Christmas,” she says. “People are finding it really, really tough, especially without the extra double-payments. They were a huge help last year, but they’re gone,” she adds, referring to the two double-payment child benefits paid in late 2024 but not repeated in this year’s budget in October. [ Saint Vincent de Paul expects over a quarter of a million Christmas calls for helpOpens in new window ] The housing crisis and the “inadequacy” of social welfare rates to meet basic needs are key drivers of poverty, says Gill. “You can hear the stress in people’s voices. People are finding it so, so hard to cover the costs of basics like food, heat and even winter clothes for their kids.” Kate Darcy, one of five information support officers on duty, takes 13 calls over a 25-minute period. If a caller is on her database, she checks their details before reassuring them a volunteer will contact them to arrange a visit before Christmas. If someone is a first-time caller, she takes details of their situation. “You’re a couple with four children?,” she asks a mother. “You are all right. No don’t apologise,” she adds “Look, I have you down for the Christmas help. We don’t have a date yet for that area but they will be out and they will call you. Keep your phone on. God bless.” Another mother calls. “It’s three children you have? And you are struggling in general? I know, I know. I really do ... No problem at all, love; don’t be worrying.” An older woman in north Dublin calls. “Are your grandchildren still there with you? They are. And how can I help you?” Darcy explains after the call that the woman missed a visit from volunteers the previous evening. “I will get them to give you a ring back ... No problem at all. Take care,” she tells the woman, On her screen a log of locations from which calls have come this morning includes areas all over Dublin: Cherry Orchard; Tallaght; Swords; Crumlin; Rathmines; Chapelizod; from Priorswood on the north side of the city to Rialto on the south side; and from Malahide in north Co Dublin down to Bray in Co Wicklow, and as far as Athy in Co Kildare. “You get calls from every area – most are from the more struggling areas, but we get calls too from Foxrock, Ranelagh, Blackrock, Killiney,” she says, referring to areas of Dublin known for their affluence. “There isn’t an area we haven’t had a call from.” Jackie Ryan, who is logging email requests for help, has had more than 1,000 since last week. “All need help with food – that or electric, or gas.” She reads some out, withholding names of senders. A mother in Dublin 10 writes: “I am looking for help for myself and my two boys. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.” Another mother, in Dublin 8, says: “Dear Vincent de Paul, I am writing to yous to request help. I am struggling immensely keeping up with bills and groceries. I am very concerned with how I am going to afford to buy my son’s presents this year considering I have not been able to save due to being so tight on money. [ ‘Why shouldn’t everyone have some nice things at Christmas?’: A day on a charity food runOpens in new window ] “I have applied for a part-time job to suits my son’s hours in school to no avail. I am under so much pressure. Any help would be highly appreciated.” “She is struggling big time,” says Ryan. “God love her.” A man in his 70s, living alone, writes: “My wife died last year. I am finding it hard on my income.” A single mother is in homeless accommodation with her daughter. “She will be three in January. I was looking for any sort of help possible for Christmas, anything at all would be greatly appreciated, so much.” Appeals for help also come in by post. Darcy reads one, written on a page torn from a child’s school copybook. “I am a full-time carer. My son has [a] disease and my grandson [lives with us]. I would greatly appreciate any help or a food voucher. I have an open fireplace if you could help me with some coal or turf. Thank you kindly.” Some of the calls can be “very distressing” for call-takers says Margo Duffy, who has been with the society for more than a decade. “There will be the odd one that just gets you. It is only when you are working in a job like this that you realise there is so much stress out there, so much poverty,” she says. The charity continues to welcome donations, of money and new toys, says Gill. “We also need more volunteers. Unfortunately, we cannot visit everyone who calls for help this Christmas because we just don’t have enough volunteers,” she says. “That is very hard.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s $28.7M ETH buy signals a new era – What’s cooking?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551532
Time Published: 2025-12-06T03:00:25Z
Full Content:
Why are giants like BlackRock and BitMine racing to amass millions of ETH? BlackRock’s latest $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum is drawing global attention. However, its true significance is being missed. This move is not a speculative gamble on a token’s price. Instead, it is a strategic signal about Ethereum’s established role as critical financial infrastructure. Moving beyond Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, BlackRock is classifying Ethereum as a key platform. It also means that BlackRock is not simply investing in a token. Instead, it is actively validating Ethereum’s role as the world’s leading financial ledger for tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs). The company must have acquired $28.78 million worth of ETH to support its growing digital products, particularly the BUIDL fund. Especially since this fund operates entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, running such a large on-chain product requires BlackRock to maintain a deep, continuous supply of Ethereum’s native gas – ETH. According to Arkham Intelligence data, BlackRock now holds a massive position of 3,944,794 ETH – Making it the third-largest holder globally after the Eth2 Beacon Deposit Contract and Binance. This institutional focus is juxtaposed against the aggressive accumulation strategy of corporate treasuries like BitMine Immersion. The firm, which is the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, recently added 69,822 ETH. In doing so, it boosted its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, while hitting 60% of its “Alchemy of 5%” supply target. Meanwhile, on the price front, ETH was trading near $3,123.46 on the charts. This, after a minor downtick at press time. However, the momentary price action may have been overshadowed by the long-term bullish sentiment fueled by these institutional moves. BlackRock recently made news for its latest buy-in, confirming that Ethereum is evolving as the active foundation for mainstream, on-chain finance. The simultaneous on-chain movement of $589 million in BTC and ETH (received from Coinbase) does not reflect a “market flush.” Instead, ETF redemption mechanics directly drive these transfers. These large transfers, even with BTC near $90,898 and ETH above $3,000 at press time, reveal a key truth. They show that visible crypto movements often represent capital exiting the ETF system, rather than entering it. This resulting market volatility does not signal weakness. On the contrary, they highlights how crypto is transitioning into a mature, institutionally-plumbed financial system.

Title: Will Solana’s price hit $500 after Vanguard’s SOL ETF decision?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551463
Time Published: 2025-12-06T01:00:43Z

Vanguard’s SOL ETF – Betting on fundamentals amid volatility? With back-to-back ETFs, the crypto market is entering one of its most aggressive adoption phases yet. Notably, this momentum isn’t limited to Bitcoin [BTC]. Instead, institutions are finally diversifying into altcoins too. Even without a confirmed “altcoin season,” the data has been seeing steady institutional demand. Solana [SOL] is leading the charge, having rolled out six spot SOL ETFs in Q4 and pulled in about $622 million in inflows so far. Notably, almost 95% of that capital has gone into Bitwise’s BSOL ETF, effectively positioning it as the BlackRock-tier heavyweight of the Solana ecosystem. In short, 2025 has finally brought altcoins into the spotlight. Source: Farside Investors Building on this momentum is Vanguard Group. For context, Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, managing over $11 trillion and serving more than 50 million investors. In a significant policy shift, the firm has opened its platform to crypto ETFs. Announced on 02 December, this move reverses Vanguard’s long-held position against crypto ETFs. This is a clear nod towards growing institutional demand for crypto. Among top-caps, Solana is also part of the mix. Vanguard’s move to support a SOL ETF isn’t just bullish for Solana. Instead, it also highlights a broader shift in institutional focus toward altcoins. Until Q4 2025, Ethereum [ETH] was the only altcoin with Spot ETFs in the U.S. However, that’s changing fast. In this context, Vanguard’s adoption of SOL marks a turning point. Even former skeptics are starting to diversify into a market once considered too volatile. Given SOL’s price action, that caution is understandable though. Source: TradingView (SOL/USDT) Notably, this policy shift comes at a particularly volatile moment too. On the charts, Solana is still one of the “worst-performing assets” across multiple timeframes. In fact, zoomed out, SOL is down about 28% on the year – Marking its worst annual performance since the -95% drop in 2022. The weekly and daily charts tell a similar story. So, what exactly is Vanguard betting on? Looking at the price alone, the ROI isn’t compelling. So, is this move driven more by Solana’s fundamentals than by short-term gains? No doubt, Solana has lived up to its “Ethereum killer” tag. While price action hasn’t always reflected it, the fundamentals tell a different story. Notably, Chainspect data makes that clear, explaining why Vanguard’s bet on SOL matters. According to Chainspect, Solana’s scalability metrics revealed a 4.78% jump in real-time TPS [1H] to 798.5 txs/s and transaction finality at 12.8 seconds. This puts it among the most-efficient high-cap blockchains currently. Source: ChainSpect Against this setup, Vanguard’s bet on Solana clearly looks long-term. As a result, a $500-target (Roughly a 270% rally from SOL’s press time price) can’t be entirely ruled out. The upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, slated for Q1 2026, is expected to give Solana’s fundamentals an additional boost. Combined with growing institutional adoption, these developments will position SOL for potentially substantial upside over the coming year. Especially as improvements in scalability strengthen its long-term fundamentals.

Title: Netflix Deal for Warner Bros. Pushes Global M&A Toward 2021 Peak

(Bloomberg) -- Global mergers and acquisitions are on pace for their best year since 2021, as a spate of late-year deals pushes deal volumes to well over $3 trillion. Netflix Inc.’s $72 billion pact for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the year’s biggest acquisition including debt, underscores how corporate titans are swinging for bold, game-changing M&A under the deal-friendly Trump administration. Dealmakers are betting that they have a once-in-a-generation chance to usher through their dream deals with little or minimal pushback from antitrust regulators. Companies have been able to tap record-breaking financing packages, including Netflix’s loan of $59 billion, which would rank among the biggest of its type. That thinking also helped foster Kimberly-Clark Corp.’s $40 billion deal for Tylenol-maker Kenvue Inc. in November and the BlackRock Inc.-led purchase of Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion in October. Then there’s Union Pacific Corp.’s deal for railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp. for more than $80 billion including debt in July, a transaction that would have been unimaginable under the previous administration. As of Thursday, global M&A volumes for the year stood at $3.3 trillion, up 37% from 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That puts 2025 on track to have the best year for dealmaking since 2021, when there were $3.8 trillion in transactions announced. The increase is even sharper in the US, where deals for companies based in the country are up 53% to almost $1.8 trillion, just short of the 2021 high-water mark, the data show. In addition to 32 deals topping $10 billion this year, the US totals have been driven by almost 300 deals of $1 billion or more. Those included transactions such as Friday’s almost $4.8 billion acquisition of industrial equipment maker SPX Flow Inc. by ITT Inc., which confirmed a Bloomberg News report. The enterprise value of the Netflix deal totals about $82.7 billion. The transaction, which also confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report on the deal being imminent, comes as Wall Street advisers and their clients dash to wrap up deals before the traditional holiday slowdown period.

Title: AIL previews: Big weekend for Ballynahinch in push to keep ground with leaders

Nearing the halfway point and festive mid-season break, the top flight of the Energia All-Ireland League is starting to take shape. The next two rounds could go a long way toward determining whether there will be a breakaway group atop the table. Going into the weekend’s fixtures, Lansdowne had opened up a five-point gap on Ballynahinch in fifth, by dint of last week’s 18-10 win which denied the Ulstermen even a bonus point. Hence, after three fifth-placed finishes in a row, ‘Hinch host leaders St Mary’s acutely mindful of not falling adrift of the leading quartet. The home side retain key men such as Ulster duo Marcus Rea, who shifts to number eight, and outhalf James Humphreys, as well as Conor Rankin and Aaron Sexton. They also appear strengthened by the return of hooker Zack McCall, ex-captain Bradley Lumey and former Irish Under-20 backrower Reuben Crothers. Then again, St Mary’s are flying high and welcome back hugely influential outhalf Conor Dean after he was rested for last week’s big win at home to Nenagh. The meeting of Terenure and Young Munster also looks significant in the playoff picture. Young Munster, who did the double over Terenure last season, sit an unlucky eighth. They have slipped 12 points off their hosts, who are third, after last week’s sixth one-score defeat of the season in their epic derby with Cork Con. Hubert Gilvarry’s hat-trick took his tally to eight tries in seven games, making the Sligo man the division’s leading try scorer. Ger Slattery shifts Munster’s Shay McCarthy to the other wing in a reshuffle and, adding to the attacking talent out wide in this game, Leinster’s Joshua Kenny makes his long-awaited debut for Terenure. Carlos Spencer also promotes Austrian-born outhalf Caspar Gabriel in a reshuffled backline and welcomes back Leinster hooker John McKee after last week’s loss in Clontarf. Cork Con and Old Belvedere renew acquaintances at Temple Hill for the first time in eight years, both sitting mid-table with identical records and both needing a win to stay within sight of the frontrunners. After last week’s big win over UCD, Old Belvedere welcome back Josh Ericson at number eight following his debut for Leinster last week. At the bottom of the table, Nenagh Ormond look to have a daunting task as they continue to search for their first points of the season at home to Clontarf. The champions make their first visit to Tipperary on the back of six successive wins and growing momentum. Nenagh have picked a new backrow and have shuffled their backline, with the 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran starting at outhalf. ‘Tarf are without Jordan Coughlan, but their injuries in midfield are offset by the return of Hugh Cooney, as well as Leinster prop Alex Usanov.

Title: Polymarket plans to use in-house market maker to trade against users: Report

The company has approached traders, including sports bettors, about joining the effort as it expands in the US; rival Kalshi faces scrutiny over similar practices. Polymarket is recruiting staff for an internal market-making team that may trade against users on its platform. The company has recently approached traders — including sports bettors — about joining the group, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the discussions. The initiative comes as Polymarket expands its US presence after resolving regulatory issues stemming from a 2022 case, when it paid a $1.4 million penalty to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi, a Polymarket competitor, already operates an internal unit known as Kalshi Trading, which places bids on its exchange to help support liquidity. The arrangement has drawn criticism from some users, and a proposed class-action lawsuit filed last month alleged that the desk sets betting lines that disadvantage customers. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have also sought external participants to supply liquidity on their platforms. On Kalshi, companies such as Susquehanna International Group have taken on market-making roles. Cointelegraph reached out to Polymarket for comment but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Polymarket is opening US app to waitlisted users after CFTC green light Prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have experienced significant growth in recent years, with both companies securing new partnerships and reaching high private-market valuations as the sector expands. The platforms enable users to bet on a wide range of events, from sports to predicting the next day’s weather in New York City. During The New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Thursday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argued that prediction markets’ trading desks could strengthen such markets’ accuracy. “If your goal is for the 99% of the people trying to get a signal about what’s going to happen in the world […] you actually want insider trading,” he said, adding that traders would benefit from “really good information” and “get a higher quality signal out of them.” He added: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who was also part of the discussion, was not so enthusiastic about prediction markets. “We try to help people navigate a 30-year outcome,” Fink said. “I don’t really care about what happens in the next moment. I’m aware in the betting market, in football, you can bet every play, but to me, this is not how I’m going to live my life.” In the third quarter of 2024, prediction markets saw a combined volume on the three largest platforms increase by 565% to $3.1 billion, up from $463.3 million in the prior quarter.

Title: State Street still using DEI to curry favor with leftist state officials — despite Wall Street clampdown

Woke investing has faced a clampdown on Wall Street, but if its critics are to be believed State Street – one of the biggest asset managers in the US – is still using it to curry favor with leftist state and local officials who control hundreds of billions of dollars in pension money, The Post has learned. State Street’s work involving controversial Diversity Equity and Inclusion and green energy policies — where it facilitates woke shareholder votes on behalf of some of its big, public pension clients — has sparked chatter on Wall Street and Washington following New York City Comptroller Brad Lander’s move last month to block rival BlackRock as a manager of the city’s pension fund. In a recent posting on X, Alabama GOP senator Tommy Tuberville said State Street, which manages $8 billion in city pension money overseen by Lander, is “already caving to the WOKE Mamdani climate agenda before he has even taken office.” Lander is a key supporter of the socialist New York City mayor elect Zohran Mandani, who himself supports policies such as DEI and green energy. For its part, State Street says it’s getting a bad rap — and it has some strong evidence suggesting as much. The bank offers nearly a dozen such proxy-voting frameworks for pension funds, including those that appeal to Red State public officials that steer clear of anything woke. It doesn’t engage directly with US companies to push stuff like Diversity Equity and Inclusion employment policies or green energy. Rather it facilitates shareholder votes on these measures for progressive pension-fund clients, people like Lander — the fiduciary of the city retirement funds — during what’s known as “proxy season,” when big investors get to vote on corporate governance proposals. Yet the controversy is real. Lander isn’t looking to ditch BlackRock – headed by investing prodigy Larry Fink – because it has done a bad job managing the retirement funds of the city’s firemen, teachers and police. Rather, Lander’s beef is that BlackRock has gone non-woke in recent years. After fully embracing corporate government policies like Environment Social Governance investing, the big asset manager no longer demands strict adherence to so-called carbon-neutral edicts, meaning it won’t force ExxonMobil to invest in windmills versus drilling. It also won’t demand strict gender and racial preferences in appointing board members. State Street, meanwhile, offers something known as the “Sustainability Stewardship Service Proxy Voting and Engagement Policy.” The policy, reviewed by The Post, dictates how the firm will push proxy or shareholder votes on shares it holds for its woke clients on a range of corporate governance edicts, including those, critics say, that are on dubious legal grounds. Those include “progress made against deforestation- and other land use-related targets and commitments” and whether portfolio companies “regularly identify whether there are risks related to human rights in their operations and value chain.” Most controversial, critics say, are the firm’s “Diversity” standards, which hold that “Effective board oversight of a company’s long-term business strategy necessitates gender diversity, and the level of such diversity depends on various factors including culture and progress made.” The standards also require board-level “racial/ethnic diversity in select markets.” State Street’s moves appear to run counter to the recent corporate shift away from DEI. Most large companies, even such diversity stalwarts as JPMorgan and BlackRock, have sought to roll back strict adherence to DEI in hiring and in business dealings – including asset management. Trump later doubled down on ending DEI, issuing an executive order that “directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations.” Press officials from State Street say there is nothing improper about how it handles DEI and other progressive shareholder votes because it’s doing so at the behest of their clients, like Lander, when they demand it. It also facilitates votes for conservative public officials who run pension assets in Middle America and the south. “The sustainability policy that you’re referencing is a policy that our clients can choose or not choose … our voting and engagement policies and practices comply with US law,” wrote spokesman Mark LaVoie. He declined to comment on Tuberville’s social-media commentary. Officials at rival banks suggest otherwise. “What they’re essentially doing is laying such mandates on clients that they are enforcing on their portfolio companies,” said a senior executive at a major money management firm.

Never miss a story. State Street said it recently revamped its policies on such matters to alert clients it won’t discuss with US portfolio companies such hot-button issues as DEI and sustainability. One reason is that it is also a federal government contractor, one of the primary targets of Trump’s executive orders ending DEI on both the federal level and in the private sector. It manages a 25% chunk of the so-called “Thrift Savings Plan,” a $1 billion retirement fund for federal government employees. A White House spokesman had no comment on State Street’s DEI activities.

The funeral is taking place in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos Award-winning architect Hugh Wallace has been described as “honest, passionate and deeply human” during his funeral at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin. Mourners were told how the TV star, who died suddenly at home at the age of 68 last Sunday, and his husband, Martin Corbett, were planning to move to a new home this weekend. His funeral service took place this morning at a packed St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin, where he was baptised. Mourners included presenters Dermot Bannon and Brendan Courtney in attendance.

Photo: Sam Boal/Collins Photos Today's News in 90 - Friday December 5 At the beginning of the service, one of Mr Wallace’s favourite songs, Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow, was played. The Dean of the cathedral, the Very Reverend William Morton, who led the service, described Mr Wallace as ”honest, direct, passionate, challenging and deeply human” and as a “man who quite literally shaped the spaces in which others live their lives”. “He lived fully. He lived deeply. He left his mark unmistakably,” he told the mourners. “For the last 10 years, since beginning with the series Home of the Year, television viewers were delighted to welcome Hugh into their living rooms. His endearing and gregarious nature, his good humour and optimism, and the fact that he was always so unassuming meant that we all thought he had been on our screens for far longer than he had,” he said. “He was, as we say, a natural with his characteristic voice, his large spectacles, colourful shirts and jumpers. “Hugh, of course, was known to many through his work on television, knowledgeable, forthright, unafraid to speak plainly and never short of conviction, he understood buildings, but more than that, he understood people.” Martin Corbett leaving after the funeral service of Hugh Wallace who passed away unexpectedly at home. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos “A home is where love abides, and everyone who knew Hugh knows that his true home was found in his life with Martin in shared work, shared laughter, shared dreams and shared courage. Their new home held so much in store for them, yet the love that filled those plans does not vanish with death,” Rev Morton added. The dean said he was “fascinated” to hear about the couple’s new house – located just next door to their current home. "Hugh had successfully sought planning permission to have a window put into his bedroom from which he could see the spire of St Patrick's [Cathedral]. "And now, as the spire he saw from his window still stands over the city, so too does the impact of his life stand as it always will in the hearts of those who knew him and who respected him.” During the funeral, friend and fellow architect John Waters paid a tribute to his late friend by making a speech as if Hugh Wallace himself was speaking to mourners. “I’m afraid I was taken by complete surprise on Sunday. I didn't think I'd get a sudden exit. I had assumed a more flamboyant exit in years to come, after much more TV success and perhaps a couple of Bafta Awards, because the rumours were there. “Things were going so well. Douglas Wallace Consultants were flying. My TV career was flying, and furniture was coming for the house that Martin and I had been working on for three years. “With everything that was going on, I'm afraid the universe took its own decision on Sunday night, and here we all are.” Mr Wallace, who was a judge on every RTÉ’s Home of the Year, was born in 1956 and the only child of Susan and Kenneth. TV personality Dermot Bannon leaving after the funeral of Hugh Wallace. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos He met his husband Martin on Valentine’s Day in 1988 at the George bar in Dublin. "Martin has often accused me of having only child syndrome, and I take that as meaning I'm a special person,” Mr Waters continued, speaking on behalf of Mr Wallace. “Some of you may remember the phrase in Dublin that love stories begin at [nightclub] Zhivago. A lot of fairy tales also began at the George pub in Dublin, and Martin and I were part of a fairytale. It was Valentine's night of 1988, and we lasted together for 37 years, which I'd take again if I could. “Martin never really bought into the celebrity stuff. Martin loved me for me; he became my civil partner in 2012, and he stuck with me to the end, right up until Sunday night. “We really did travel the world together and meet very interesting people, but behind the celebrity and the public persona, Martin and I were really two ordinary guys. We had the same hopes, fears, dreams and wants as everyone else. “I'm just going to ask you to remember I've had some of the best times of my life with most of you, or some of you. It's important that when you think of those, you smile, don't be sad. Give Martin a shoulder to lean on if he needs it, be kind to each other." He later quoted William Shakespeare, and said: “Let thee all remember that a pop of colour will brighten your day.” TV presenter Brendan Courtney arrives for the funeral of tv personality and architect Hugh Wallace who passed away unexpectedly at home on the 1st of Dec 2025. The funeral is taking place in St Patricks Cathedral, Dublin. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos Mr Wallace always knew he was going to have a career in architecture and design, he said. “I met a kindred spirit, Alan Douglas, and by the end of 1982, in the face of a biting recession, we set up Douglas Wallace architects from our rented flat in Blackrock. So things were starting to move, and we were starting to be known. It was a mad, busy time. There were ups, there were downs, there were tears, there was laughter, there was building of lifetime friendships. “Then came the 90s, and we got bigger contracts, shopping centres, bars, restaurants. We grew, projects got bigger. Our offices got bigger. We had offices in London, Belfast, Prague. We're doing hotels with designers and hotels with visionaries. “Then came 2008, and we all fell over the cliff. They say you can't keep good men down. And from the ashes of Douglas Wallace Mark One came Douglas Wallace Consultants, a new gang of tightly knit directors, of which I am pleased to say I was still part. ”Later on in my career, I got a real lucky break in relation to the TV programmes. It was such a shock to me that that came at that age, but I really embraced it. "As you all know, I loved it, and I'm chuffed to bits with the feedback that I got in terms of the knowledge that I was able to share. I was privileged to do that in the way I did.” The funeral cortege arrives at Dublin's St Patrick's Cathedral. Photo: SAM BOAL/Collins Photos

Today’s top news: Barriers keep falling down, and institutional adoption is here. The CFTC has formally approved spot crypto trading on CFTC-regulated exchanges, a first in the U.S. Newly approved rules allow CFTC-registered exchanges to list spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. And Bitnomial is expected to be the first venue to launch under the new framework. Until now, spot crypto trading in the U.S. has lived in a regulatory gray zone. It was supervised indirectly but never explicitly approved. This is the first time that the CFTC has authorized a federally regulated spot market. And it comes in a hallmark week that included Vanguard and Charles Schwab opening their doors to spot crypto ETF trading. “For the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years, with the customer protections and market integrity that Americans deserve.” - CFTC Chair Caroline Pham “For the first time ever, spot crypto can trade on CFTC-registered exchanges that have been the gold standard for nearly a hundred years”… IMO, basically paves way for *every* major brokerage to offer spot crypto trading & feel comfortable from a regulatory perspective. Huge. pic.twitter.com/XMjaPl3RXL — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 5, 2025 The U.S. now has the beginnings of a fully regulated spot crypto market, something institutions have been waiting for for years. At the same time, retail investors at Schwab and Vanguard, two of the largest brokerages in the country, now have the ability to buy crypto ETFs with the click of a few buttons. This is what has been accomplished in the past few months: It’s never been easier to enter the crypto market than it is right now. Now we will see who indeed enters.

Title: No, Progressives Don’t Want “Purity.” They Just Want Some Courage.

Time Published: 2025-12-05T11:00:00Z

Mainstream Democrats use dozens of old catchphrases that suggest they’re out of step. “When they go low, we go high,” for example, sounded fine when Michelle Obama first said it in 2016, but it passed its sell-by date almost the next day. For quite some time, the Democratic Party, which is still closely aligned with banks and billionaires, has needed to go anywhere but high. But it’s the meme of the “purity test” that should spike real worry that the Democratic Party is missing the moment right now. Party standard-bearers still use the phrase as a slur to trivialize legitimate questions from the left. It’s a petty and defensive move, and it comes across as a refusal to engage with the most obvious and urgent questions facing the party and the country. A recent case in point involved New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Booker is a tireless legislator who two weeks ago sponsored a promising bill to provide support for family caregivers, but he has sometimes been criticized for his coziness with Big Tech and Big Pharma. In October, the popular firebrand Jennifer Welch of the podcast I’ve Had It asked Booker why he and other Democrats had turned to “Neville Chamberlain–type appeasement” with President Trump. As just one example, Welch cited Booker’s confirmation of one of Trump’s shadiest ambassadors, Charlie Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s father-in-law; a felon and a billionaire real-estate developer from Booker’s home state of New Jersey. “What do you have to say about the capitulation that you participated in?” Booker smiled. He tried to seem unflappable. He then waved away Welch as “holding up a purity test.” “That’s such bullshit,” Welch shot back. “It’s not a purity test. It’s, Are we in this fight? Are we being beholden to corporations and corporate interests? Or, Are we really the party of the working class?” Welch was right. “Purity test” is bullshit, and it’s a deflection Democrats must stop using. Challenges to politicians on major issues, including foreign policy, acceptance of corporate money, and failure to keep ICE out of cities—these are not puritanical attacks on their lifestyles. They are credible allegations that the party must acknowledge and address: that Democrats are allies of Republican hawks like Liz Cheney, valets for private equity, and hopeless incrementalists on social justice. (“Never forget that slavery lasted over 200 years,” said the comedian Christina Brown, playing a generic Democrat, in an extremely popular video sketch. “Because progress takes time.” Another “Democrat” in the sketch, this one played by Prance, added, “We’re going to stand up for Black people. Blackrock. Blackwater mercenaries. Blackstone. Black sites. Black ops.”) To dismiss the concerns of progressives is to deepen the demoralization that many of them have felt since 2015, when, as they see it, Democrats put Trump in office by keeping Senator Bernie Sanders and his then-insurgent socialism off the ticket. Right or wrong, the Democrats’ failure to nominate Sanders in 2016 is the origin story of the modern left, and they’re sticking to it. That cursed election is not available for relitigation. So now it’s up to older Democrats, who came up believing that unfettered capitalism was the country’s one true path, to stop trying to censor this generation of liberals, and start learning from them. And if the Democratic leadership doesn’t want to watch satire on TikTok to understand their own party, they can at least look at the polls. According to Gallup in September, fully 66 percent of Democrats view socialism, by that name, favorably. Bullishness on socialism is up a whopping 16 points since 2010, Obama’s heyday. At the same time, per the Gallup poll, only 17 percent of Democrats view big business favorably, while—and this is especially surprising—a mere 36 percent of independents do. Anti-monopoly views are clearly no longer the province only of sullen Occupy alumni. Look at those numbers. The vast majority of the gettable electorate can now be spooked by even a hint that the Democratic Party is ignoring the people in favor of rich or ideological donors, corporate interests, Black Rock, Blackstone, and billionaire PACs. The purity-test dodge seems to have started during the presidential primary of 2019, when Barack Obama told a room of Bay Area donors that Democrats running for president should not be “woke” or engage in “cancel culture.” (Why did that daft formulation waylay so many minds, institutions, and opinion pages?) Nor, Obama said, should Democrats run on positions that could turn off the center and the center-right. What those positions were exactly he didn’t say, but good guesses include taxing the rich and downscaling the police. “I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections,” he told the Silicon Valley crowd. “Because, you know what, the country is complicated.” Complicated? Was that 2019-speak for something like “hopping with billionaires who must not be taxed”? If by “complicated” Obama had meant the country was increasingly socialist, he would have come closer to the mark. But in those days “complexity” was all about trying to seduce Republicans and the rich. A few months after Obama’s fundraising event, Pete Buttigieg, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, reprised the purity-test dodge on the debate stage. Senator Elizabeth Warren, also a candidate, pressed him on his ties to robber-baron donors, and he responded that this wasn’t fair game. To mention the opulence of his donor parties, he said, was nothing but a “purity test.” Five years later, sounding out politicians for their connections to billionaires doesn’t seem so persnickety. With their massively successful “Fight Oligarchy” national tour, which has drawn 261,100 attendees so far, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and good old Bernie have skillfully energized the party’s progressive grassroots and quietly reoriented the whole Democratic enterprise. Progressive Democrats no longer just oppose the bottomlessly corrupt billionaire in the White House. They oppose all billionaires, of every party, as they are all bottomlessly corrupt—and have long rigged politics and the economy to consolidate power, exploit workers, pursue white nationalism, and wage war. If Democrats, when asked, can’t commit to opposing oligarchy, they’re not failing purity tests. They’re hiding a dangerous and right-wing worldview, and Americans deserve to know about it. Socialism may have been sidelined in 2015, and again in 2019, but it’s on all the tickets now. Virginia Heffernan is the author of the Substack newsletter Magic + Loss.

Title: Bitcoin Vindicated: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Eats His Words

Time Published: 2025-12-05T10:59:31Z

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has retracted his earlier statements criticizing Bitcoin (BTC) as a tool for money laundering and theft. Since his criticism, BlackRock has become the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with Fink evolving into a strong advocate of the premier cryptocurrency. After previously taking a hard stance toward Bitcoin, Larry Fink has reiterated a change of heart toward the largest cryptocurrency. In a recent interview, the BlackRock CEO admitted that his former views on Bitcoin were wrong, and new insights have forced a shift in perspective for digital assets.According to Fink, interactions with thousands of clients, including government leaders, as the BlackRock CEO revealed the upsides of Bitcoin. For Fink, Bitcoin is now an international asset class with the BlackRock CEO underscoring BTC’s inflation-hedging and borderless properties in several interviews. “I had very strong views,” said Fink. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not wrong. My thought process always evolves.” Back in 2017, Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering” while dismissing it as speculation and “not a real investment.” In 2018, Fink noted that BlackRock had no interest in a Bitcoin ETF, maintaining that its clients were not keen on cryptocurrency exposure.Starting in 2020, Fink’s public comments indicated a streak of neutrality. In multiple interviews, the BlackRock CEO acknowledged Bitcoin’s potential but raised concerns over its volatility and dire lack of regulation. In the following years, Fink and BlackRock began paying significant attention to Bitcoin, mulling the possibilities of tokenization using blockchain technology. Things reached a crescendo in 2023 after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, citing growing clients’ need for BTC exposure. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in early 2024, the ETF recorded a flying start. At the moment, IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $72 billion in assets under management (AUM), reflecting massive institutional interest in the asset class. Barely two years since its launch, Bitcoin ETFs are now BlackRock’s largest revenue drivers, surpassing revenue-generating two-decade-old products for the asset manager. For context, BlackRock manages over 1,600 ETFs globally, with IBIT on course to clinch $100 billion in AUM.

Bitcoin could extend its recent rebound after posting a 7% daily gain on Wednesday, with 2026 likely to be the crypto’s most bullish year yet. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse cited regulatory progress and institutional interest as the secret sauce for Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by the end of 2026. During a recent panel discussion alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance co-CEO Richard Teng as part of Binance Blockchain Week, Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse boldly projected that the Bitcoin price could grind all the way to $180,000 per coin before the end of next year. “I’ll go out on a limb, and I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000, December 31, 2026,” Garlinghouse postulated, indicating strong optimism about the alpha cryptocurrency’s long-term price trajectory. Bitcoin was trading for $93,216 at publication time, up a meagre 0.1 percentage over the past 24 hours period, CoinGecko data shows. The leading crypto hit a record peak of $126,080 just two months ago before sagging. The Ripple CEO expects 2026 to be the most bullish year for the crypto industry to date due to several factors. “There are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that, as we go into 2026, I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” he opined. First, Garlinghouse notes that after years of being hostile to the crypto sector, the United States has finally achieved regulatory clarity under the Trump administration. This drastic regulatory change, according to him, is significantly undervalued. Garlinghouse then highlighted that renowed Wall Street giants are now foraying the market. Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and now even Vanguard, which previously held a long-standing anti-crypto stance, is now allowing its 50 million clients to invest in regulated digital asset products. Crypto has transitioned beyond mere speculation into real-world utility. More improved interfaces and practical applications indicate that crypto is beginning to solve real problems. Per Garlinghouse, this will buoy a prolonged bull rally. “The last thing I’ll say on this (which I think we’ll probably all agree about) is we’re also seeing real-world applications, where it’s not just about the speculation,” he explained. Other industry pundits are less optimistic. As ZyCrypto reported last month, veteran trader Peter Brandt claimed BTC will not reach $200k by the end of this year as widely tipped by various strategists. For Brandt, the next bull run leading to that price level will take place over four years.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Woori Bank is now displaying Bitcoin prices in its main trading room in Seoul. On Dec. 5, South Korean multinational financial institution Woori Bank announced that it had begun to display the prices of Bitcoin BTC $91 281 24h volatility: 1.9% Market cap: $1.82 T Vol. 24h: $40.25 B in its main trading room in Seoul. It included won-dollar exchange rates and stock market data alongside. The trading room is a meeting place for market makers, where frontline trading of foreign exchange, bonds, and derivatives takes place. An official of the bank noted that the initiative is in response to the growing prominence of crypto. “As digital assets continue to grow in prominence and influence in global financial markets, we determined that they should be monitored as a key indicator to better read overall market trends,” the Woori Bank official stated. Interestingly, the financial ecosystem has been seeing a subtle push towards the integration of the Traditional Finance (TradFi) system and digital asset markets. There have been quite a number of alliances set to spark such integrations. Recently, American crypto exchange Kraken signed a strategic partnership deal with Deutsche Börse to bridge TradFi and crypto. Together, they intend to engage in trading, custody, settlement, collateral management, and tokenized assets. Similarly, Hana Financial Group and Dunamu signed an agreement recently to introduce blockchain technology to services such as overseas remittances. Woori Bank is yet to hint at an alliance with a crypto company, but its announcement signals deep interest in the digital asset world. One of the ways that the TradFi sector has been integrating with crypto is through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Top asset management firms with billions in Assets under management (AUM), like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Fidelity, have issued one or more crypto ETFs and are still looking to list more. A few days ago, Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF officially began live trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca platform. It was listed under the ticker “SOEZ,” while its XRP ETF, which went live earlier, was listed as EZRP. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: ETH to $62,000? Tom Lee Is Ultra Bullish but Traders Watch These Numbers

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BitMine’s Tom Lee predicts an ultra-bullish climb toward $62,000 for Ethereum following the Fusaka upgrade on Dec. 3. Tom Lee, the chairman of ETH ETH $3 115 24h volatility: 2.1% Market cap: $376.32 B Vol. 24h: $23.75 B holding company BitMine Immersion Technologies, believes that the crypto market has already survived its harshest correction phase. Speaking at Blockchain Week in Dubai, he argued that the pullback that began in October is over. Lee talked about previous cycles where similar drops resolved within six to eight weeks and added that the market is entering its reversal window. According to Lee, fears tied to quantum threats, liquidation cascades, and concerns around Tether and MicroStrategy contributed to the recent market anxiety. Yet he now sees evidence that market makers have stabilized. In his view, crypto’s bullish cycle will resume, and the traditional idea of Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles no longer applies. When discussing Ethereum, Lee remained exceptionally optimistic and said that major financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and others are building real-world asset tokenization rails on Ethereum. From his perspective, Ethereum is evolving into the core financial settlement layer of the global economy. He said that if Ethereum returns to its historical average ratio versus Bitcoin, ETH could trade near $12,000. A return to the 2021 peak ratio places ETH close to $22,000. But Lee’s most ambitious forecast assumes ETH grows into the backbone of worldwide settlement which could lift the ETH/BTC ratio toward 0.25 and push Ethereum to roughly $62,000. According to a recent release, the firm now holds more than $12 billion worth of Ether. Earlier today, Lookonchain revealed that BitMine had accumulated 41,946 ETH, worth about $130.78 million, at a price near $3,100. It seems that Tom Lee(@fundstrat)'s #Bitmine just bought another 41,946 $ETH($130.78M) 5 hours ago.https://t.co/adab0TBF5Phttps://t.co/bYWnrPoBLU pic.twitter.com/z8QPzY0q95 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 5, 2025 Analyst Ali Martinez took a more practical approach while sharing Lee’s words. While he acknowledged the possibility of a $62,000 ETH, the analyst argued that the market must first clear critical resistance levels. $62,000 $ETH!?? It could be… But first, Ethereum needs to break $4,800. And even then, the next key targets are $6,800 and $8,800. https://t.co/JQEazwCIzi pic.twitter.com/tl2wzaCKQ0 — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2025 According to Martinez, Ethereum needs to break above $4,800 to unlock momentum. Beyond that, the next major targets lie at $6,800 and $8,800. Clearing these levels will make ETH the next crypto to explode in the next cycle. Meanwhile, according to CryptoQuant analysts, Ethereum’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio on Binance climbed to 0.998 immediately following the Fusaka network upgrade. This was the highest reading since early August. ETH taker buy sell ratio | Source: CryptoQuant A breakout above 1.0 would confirm the end of November’s correction and open the path toward the $3,500 and $4,000 zones. CryptoQuant also noted that Ethereum’s cumulative volume delta (CVD) on Binance has shown sharp spikes of buying interest, and the indicator is now in positive territory. Binance ETH CVD momentum and price correlation 30D | Source: CryptoQuant The 30-day correlation between price and CVD remains at a relatively high 0.6. According to analysts, this pattern confirms that traders are accumulating dips in anticipation of increased liquidity as future upgrades approach.

Title: Military preparedness 'best way to avoid war': President Lai

ROC Central News Agency 12/04/2025 02:49 PM Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA) President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸ å¾·) said in a U.S. media interview that Taiwan is "working side by side" with other democracies to deter a Chinese invasion and "robust preparations are the best way to avoid war and achieve peace." Speaking in a prerecorded video interview, which aired Wednesday (U.S. time) at The New York Times DealBook Summit, Lai said that "peace is priceless and war has no winners." "While we aspire to peace, we cannot harbor illusions about it," Lai told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin, the Taiwanese president's first foreign media interview since he announced a US$40 billion special defense budget on Nov. 26. "Peace must be secured through strength. This is why we are increasing our defense budget and strengthening our national defense capabilities while also cutting back our economic dependence on China," Lai added. Taiwan's president was one of more than a dozen interviewees at the Times' event, which also featured conversations with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. In the interview, which lasted around 10 minutes, Sorkin asked Lai about China's goal of being capable of "taking Taiwan by force by 2027" and what he thought China's current timeline could be. "Whatever timeline China's People's Liberation Army may have, Taiwan's fundamental principle is that we must be ready first," Lai added, before expressing gratitude to the international community for their support of Taiwan. The well-known American journalist then asked Lai how confident he felt about U.S. President Donald Trump's support for Taiwan. "Our relationship truly is rock solid," Lai said of the long-standing relationship between the two sides, adding that U.S. cooperation with Taiwan has expanded since Trump assumed office. On the Russia-Ukraine war, Lai said Taiwan stands with the people of Ukraine, and that he hopes "this irrational and illegitimate war will be over as soon as possible so that the Ukrainian people will no longer have to suffer." "However, in ending this war, we also hope that Ukraine's national dignity and the well-being of its people will be respected and future conflict will be prevented," Lai explained. Sorkin, a financial columnist for The New York Times and co-anchor of CNBC's business news show "Squawk Box," turned the interview to the topic of semiconductors. Noting the Trump administration's desire to manufacture "40 to 50 percent of all semiconductors in the next couple of years," Sorkin asked whether Lai was concerned about Taiwan potentially being "less valuable" to the U.S. in the future. Lai said that "semiconductors are a global ecosystem" and that he hopes that Taiwan can "support the re-industrialization of the U.S." through investments in the country. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and other Taiwanese semiconductor firms invest in the U.S., Japan, Europe, or "wherever they believe is needed," Lai said. On the question of whether Trump's 40 to 50 percent domestic semiconductor manufacturing goal was realistic or not, Lai said that this would depend on the U.S. government's ability to facilitate land, water and electricity supply, workforce and talent development, and investment incentives. Later in the interview, Lai said that Taiwan's decision around the year 2000 not to relocate its most advanced manufacturing to China was correct. He also said that leaders around the world should work together to "take steps to prevent AI from becoming a bubble" so that the industry can drive long-term global growth.

Title: The Germans Are World Champions for Rearmament

Time Published: 2025-12-05T07:22:28Z

Every year, not only does Santa Claus come around, but also a report on global arms production and trade by SIPRI. SIPRI stands for Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The international peace research institute in Sweden’s capital has now taken a close look at the sales and profits of arms companies[1]. And it turns out that never before in human history has so much money been spent on armaments as it is now. Some of the increases in sales can be described as exorbitant. Or should we say obscene? At a time when sheer deprivation in certain areas, such as Gaza, has reached absolutely unbearable levels; at a time when farmland is becoming infertile and forests are being destroyed; at a time when education and healthcare can no longer keep pace with the increasing challenges – at such a time, many governments have the audacity to literally vaporize more and more taxpayers’ money on armament. This can only be good news for arms manufacturers, their shareholders and asset managers. SIPRI has only included the hundred largest arms manufacturers in its calculations. So these figures do not document the full extent of the economic waste. Nevertheless, for the year 2024, we arrive at the staggering sum of 676 billion dollars that has been diverted from the coffers of the taxpayer solidarity community into the pockets of arms profiteers. That was almost six per cent more than a year earlier. Mind you, we are only talking about the purchase of new weapons and ammunition here. Not the maintenance of equipment and buildings. Not the personnel costs and retirement pensions for former soldiers, the often traumatised or maimed veterans of various perverse excursions to foreign countries. First of all, it is interesting to observe the large regional differences in the purchase of new war toys. It will come as no surprise that US-based arms manufacturers, with an order volume of 336 billion US dollars, account for the lion’s share of the business with 49 per cent. And anyone who already has such a dominant position can be satisfied with year-on-year growth of around four per cent. However, US companies would be wise not to rest on their laurels too much. After all, the relatively slow growth of the US arms industry may well be its own fault. Table leader Lockheed Martin has severely tested the patience of its customers with its F-35 fighter jet. The F-35 is delivered to customers on average three quarters of a year after the promised delivery date. And then the metal bird is significantly more expensive than originally promised. It is precisely this unreliability that is also attributed to other arms manufacturers Made in the USA. This is not exactly helpful for long-term customer loyalty. A study from the United States had already complained in 2009 that the government awards arms contracts without tenders[2]. And that every member of Congress in Washington only approves an arms project if it creates jobs for their constituency. Arms projects are therefore not planned with a view to finding the best technical solution. Instead, the aim is to find a solution that all members of Congress can agree on. It could therefore be that the enormously inflated American war machine is a paper tiger. We will see if this is the case when the US eventually encounters a truly equal opponent. The real action in the arms industry is currently taking place in Europe. The war in Ukraine is seen as a suitable pretext to really show off. As a result, the business of European arms companies rose by 13 per cent in 2024 compared to the previous year. Overall, European killers are represented in the Top One Hundred chart with 151 billion dollars and a 22 per cent market share. Twenty-six European companies share the pie. With BAE Systems, the United Kingdom has a real heavyweight in fourth place in the world rankings with 52.2 billion dollars and growth of 7.7 per cent. With sales of $26 billion and growth of 12 per cent, France has just half the potential of the British. New entry to the charts is the Czechoslovak Group, with a phenomenal 193 per cent increase in sales and a value of $3.6 billion. The Czech arms manufacturer owes this meteoric rise to lucrative orders from Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence contractor JSC Ukrainian Defence Industry posted a 41 per cent increase in sales last year, with a turnover of three billion dollars. Russia, on the other side, has lost market share on the international export market. However, this is being offset by its involvement on the Ukrainian front. The Russian arms industry is concentrated in the state-owned Rostec corporation. However, Rostec’s turnover is only slightly higher than that of French corporations, namely 27.1 billion dollars, with growth of 26 per cent[3]. The Russian defence budget is actually rather modest, and is even set to be reduced next year. In order to inflate the destructive power of the Russian bear, the German media are repeatedly reporting that Russia wants to increase its budget for 2026 to a whopping 12.93 trillion roubles[3]. However, they fail to convert this amount into euros. This is because one rouble is equivalent to one euro cent[4]. The Russians therefore want to spend around 129 billion euros on their defence next year. That is less than a tenth of what the Western community of values spends on its armaments. While Japan and South Korea are also recording fabulous growth with their arms companies, developments in China are moving in the opposite direction. With a total volume of 88.3 billion dollars, Chinese arms companies have suffered a ten per cent decline compared to the previous year. However, this is not the result of an increasingly pacifist attitude in China – unfortunately not. Rather, the Chinese arms industry has been rocked by a huge corruption scandal. Large numbers of senior staff have had to be dismissed. And now a restructuring process is underway that is paralysing the industry for a certain period of time. However, this should have settled down again by next year. You may well have wondered whether, in the heat of the moment, I might have forgotten Germany. Not at all. I am now turning my attention specifically to Germany. This is because the German arms industry stands out in all this arms race madness. Germany has a total of four arms companies in the top one hundred. And only the Czech Republic, as already mentioned, has higher growth rates than Germany. The Diehl Group increased its share by 53 per cent to 2.1 billion dollars. And the much better-known Rheinmetall Group, ranked 20th in the charts, increased its share by 47 per cent to 8.2 billion. Plans assume that Rheinmetall could move up to second place in the ranking of the world’s largest arms companies in a few years. This is very strange, however. German politicians are actively promoting the unilateral restructuring of their own economy towards militarisation. While Germany is showing serious signs of increasing deindustrialisation, the federal government is willingly allowing this undesirable development to happen. It is simply pushing an arms industry as a new model over the flattened civilian economy. And because an exorbitant increase in the military budget cannot be financed from the regular federal budget, they are simply brazenly ignoring the debt brake, which has so far been used to reject pretty much every funding measure in the areas of education, health and infrastructure. A ‘special fund’, i.e. rapid debt accumulation outside and parallel to the federal budget. In the coming fiscal year 2026, 108.2 billion euros are actually to be squandered on armament[5]. Around 80 billion euros will come from the regular federal budget pot. An additional 25 billion euros will come from the so-called special fund. To pay for this, pensioners, among others, will have to tighten their belts. Other areas will also have to tighten their belts. With this model, the German government is following in the footsteps of the United States after the Second World War. At that time, just a few years after the fighting ended, a gigantic military-industrial complex was built up, which gradually stifled the civilian economy more and more. The USA no longer produced for civilian purposes. Everything that was not nailed down was imported: food, consumer goods. Because less and less was being invested in broad-based development, the USA brought in skilled workers from abroad – a phenomenon known as brain drain. The USA could afford to do this because, after the Second World War, it had gathered the rest of the world around it and was able to dictate the rules of the game. With the dollar as the reserve currency, the US was able to gain advantages that no other country in the world is allowed to enjoy. The US was able to determine the terms of the oil trade at its own discretion. And if any country in the world refused to accept the Pax Americana, there were harsh punitive expeditions and regime change manoeuvres. Have the German elites not understood anything? A complete conversion of the economy into a military-industrial complex is something you have to be able to afford. Germany is not the centre of the world. Germany is a decapitated limb of the American power machine. The German military will never be in a position to subjugate other countries and cover them with punitive expeditions. Meanwhile, Germany has repeatedly attempted to become the hegemon in the European Union. However, these attempts have failed miserably time and again, falling short halfway. The attempt to break out of the dead end of deindustrialisation through militarisation is doomed to failure from the outset. We can already write off Germany’s military power as a pitiful ruin. It may be that the failure of this project to establish Germany as a military power will cause the elites to flee, leaving a political vacuum, just as in 1918. If we can counter this militaristic nonsense with a concept of civil society, there will be a unique opportunity for a more humane Germany. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin Dip Attracts Gradual Buying From Sovereign Funds—CEO

Reports have disclosed a sharp rebound in crypto markets this week, with Bitcoin jumping 8% to trade above $93,000 after sliding from lows under $85,000 earlier in the week. Traders are watching the Federal Reserve’s December actions closely as they try to gauge how much liquidity will return to markets. The move pushed bitcoin back within reach of a roughly $2 trillion market cap. According to BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, several sovereign wealth funds have been quietly adding to positions as prices fell from a peak near $126,000. “There are a number of sovereign funds that are standing by…. and they’re buying ‘incrementally’ as the Bitcoin price has retreated from its $126,000 peak,” Fink said. He said these buyers are taking a gradual approach — adding over time rather than making quick bets — and treating holdings as multi-year positions. Reports have disclosed that public funds in Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg have bought into BlackRock’s IBIT bitcoin fund in recent months. Fink warned that markets remain skewed and that volatility will persist while many players remain highly leveraged. Fink has been vocal about tokenization as a major theme for the coming years. Based on reports, he wrote in The Economist that tokenization could grow as quickly as the internet did in its early days, noting that Amazon had only $16 million in sales in 1996. BlackRock, the $10 trillion asset manager he runs, has pushed the idea that a digital wallet could one day hold stocks, bonds and tokenized assets together. Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said some of the largest banks are already working with Coinbase on stablecoins, custody and trading services, though he did not name the banks. According to remarks made at a DealBook event alongside Andrew Ross Sorkin and Brian Armstrong, Fink described bitcoin in emotional terms: ownership often reflects worries about physical safety or financial security. He tied demand to concerns over the debasement of financial assets and rising deficits. Reports have also quoted him warning that the US risks falling behind other governments if it does not speed up adoption of tokenization and other digital tools. US President Donald Trump has similarly warned about competition from China in crypto innovation. Traders are already pricing in a variety of scenarios. Some are betting on a major development in 2026 that could reshape demand; others remain focused on short-term policy moves from the Fed. Bitcoin’s recent 8% gain was the largest daily jump since May, but it came after sharp swings that highlighted how quickly positions can reverse. With significant capital now involved — and big names publicly backing tokenization — the market is likely to see more headline-driven moves.

Title: ECB frets at prospect of Trump ally running US central bank

A politicized Fed could be bad news for central banks everywhere, officials fear. AI generated Text-to-speech European Central Bank officials are growing increasingly jittery as Kevin Hassett — a close ally of President Donald Trump with very little central bank experience — emerges as the frontrunner to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve. A report last week by Bloomberg described Hassett, whom Trump picked at the start of the year to head the White House National Economic Council, as the “emerging front-runner” to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Hassett’s rise has set off alarm bells in Frankfurt. European officials fear Hassett, under pressure from his boss in the White House, could push the Fed into cutting interest rates far more aggressively than Powell — even though that might risk unleashing another wave of inflation that could ripple out across the world. “If markets obtain a firm belief that the new [Fed chair] is subject to fiscal or any other dominance at the expense of the inflation target, there will be capital flight from the U.S. and an erosion of the value of the dollar with serious consequences worldwide — including higher inflation,” one ECB official said. Like others interviewed for this story, the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “There is a possibility that the U.S. will have some inflationary bias ... because of the political involvement,” a second ECB official warned. The Bloomberg report came just before Thanksgiving, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had whittled down a long roster of candidates into a shorter list. Later during the holiday weekend, aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters that “I know who I’m gonna pick,” but he told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he wouldn’t announce his decision until early in the new year. Prediction markets such as Polymarket have made Hassett the odds-on favorite since then. “For Trump, Hassett would be the best choice,” a third ECB official agreed, noting the candidate’s political proximity to the White House. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed since returning to office in January, blasting Powell — whom he appointed as Chair during his first term — as a “numbskull” and a “major loser” for not cutting interest rates more quickly. The Fed withstood the pressure until September, when signs of a slowdown in the labor market emerged. It cut rates again in October, but Powell upset those expecting more easing soon by warning that another cut in December is by no means “a done deal.” Since then, several of his colleagues on the Federal Open Markets Committee have expressed reluctance to cut any further in December, pointing to an inflation rate stuck above the 2 percent target. Usually, when the labor market weakens, so does inflation, but that hasn’t happened this time. At both of his last two press conferences, Powell noted that the Fed’s dual mandate of keeping prices stable while pursuing full employment were currently “in tension” with each other. Hassett has presented a very different view, telling CNBC in November that “inflation has come way down” from the 5 percent that it averaged during Joe Biden’s presidency andthat “the trajectory is really, really, really good if you look at it.” That’s despite U.S. headline inflation actually rising in four of the last five months. That is why many in Frankfurt see alternative candidates — including the dovish but experienced Fed Governor Christopher Waller — as far safer choices. Also still in the running, according to various sources, are former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock fixed-income chief Rick Rieder, and sitting Governor Michelle Bowman. For decades, relations between the Fed and the ECB have been collegial and cooperative. Members of the small, globally connected circle of central bankers have long seen themselves as a kind of fraternity. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, then-ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet liked to emphasize that closeness by repeatedly referring to Fed Chair Ben Bernanke as “my good friend Ben.” More recently, as Powell has come under fire from the White House, European colleagues have rushed to defend him. Lagarde told a Washington Post event in April that “I have … enormous respect for Chair Powell, and I know that he’s doing exactly what’s expected of him to serve the American people.” Deutsche Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel echoed such comments more recently. Outside the eurozone, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey — another central banker anxious about the risk of financial volatility — called Powell “a man of the utmost integrity.” With Powell’s departure looming, ECB officials increasingly fear that this long-standing, trust-based relationship may be nearing its end, a fourth official told POLITICO. These concerns have already begun to influence the ECB’s strategic considerations in other areas, including liquidity policies and its own leadership succession. The ECB declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Ben Munster) The shortlist for the new vice-presidency suggests a further extension of male dominance in the Eurosystem. The attractiveness of alternative backstops is rising in a financial system that may be losing its anchor. Central bank president delivers a rueful “told you so” But Germany may also want a say in the race to replace Christine Lagarde.

Title: Ripple CEO Predicts 2026 Will Be A Breakout Year For Crypto

At Binance Blockchain Week on December 3, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued that a rare alignment of regulatory change, institutional demand and real-world utility is setting up crypto for what he called powerful “macro tailwinds” heading into 2026. “I personally will echo some of the things Richard said: there are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that I think as we go into 2026 I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” the Ripple CEO told CNBC’s Dan Murphy, speaking alongside Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu. He framed the latest drawdown not as the start of a structural bear market but as a risk-off interlude against a fundamentally improved backdrop. “Crypto has gone through cycles and when you have risk-on people are excited […] now you have kind of a risk-off moment, there’s uncertainty,” he said. The difference this time, he argued, is that the United States—the largest single economy and roughly “22% of global GDP”—is finally moving away from what he described as years of open hostility toward the sector. “This is a market that has been really openly hostile to crypto for four or five years or maybe longer, and now you have that that has changed significantly, pretty quickly,” he said. Institutions, in his view, are only beginning to adjust. He pointed to the visible presence of traditional asset managers at the event: “You saw Franklin Templeton on stage here, you saw BlackRock on stage just this week. I think Vanguard has now opened up […] Vanguard historically has said ‘we won’t touch crypto’ and now they’ve had a massive sea change.” On crypto ETFs, the Ripple CEO rejected the idea that the trade was over-hyped. “Definitely no,” he said when asked whether the ETF “floor” narrative had been exaggerated. He stressed how new these vehicles still are in the United States and highlighted early demand for XRP products. “In the last two or three weeks over $700 million have flowed into XRP ETFs, which is just pent-up demand from institutional investors, from investors who want access because they don’t want to custody themselves,” he said. He argued that the key metric is crypto’s still-small slice of the overall ETF universe. “The total ETF market—only one or two percent of the total ETF market is crypto. I will bet anybody here that a year from now that will be more than one or two percent,” he said. Short-term outflows from Bitcoin products, he suggested, should be viewed in context: “Over 2026 do we really think crypto ETFs are only going to be one or two percent of the total ETF market? No chance.” Garlinghouse said Ripple’s own prime brokerage business is already seeing that shift in behavior. Institutions that had remained “on the sidelines” due to regulatory uncertainty or risk aversion are now “getting involved and they’re starting small, and they’re going to walk, then they’re going to crawl—or crawl then walk then run.” Asked directly whether recent volatility had deterred institutional capital, he replied: “Definitely not.” Stablecoins were another pillar of his 2026 thesis. He agreed that in the latest risk-off phase, capital largely rotated into stablecoins rather than exiting on-chain rails, which he said reflects both utility and trust. “People are recognizing stablecoins can be stable and easier to manage,” he said. Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s own stablecoin, launched “just over a year ago,” has “just passed about a billion market cap,” is “approved and whitelisted in Abu Dhabi,” and is being used as “good collateral on various platforms from a lending point of view.” For him, stablecoins are an entry ramp to broader adoption, alongside other applications that will be built across Solana, Binance and Ripple ecosystems. On US policy, he said the trajectory has clearly improved, especially for payment tokens. He cited the GENIUS Act as “regulatory clarity for stablecoins” and linked it to growing corporate interest in on-chain payments. After Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury, which has visibility into “over 10 trillion dollars of payments,” he said “the number of those customers that are already approaching us interested in leveraging stablecoins […] because of that clarity, people are leaning in.” The Ripple CEO noted that XRP has already received a form of clarity from US federal courts but said broader legislation is still needed. He referenced the “Clarity Act” for crypto, saying there is “still forward momentum” and predicting that “sometime in the first half of next year we’ll see passage of legislation, which will continue to unlock and create more tailwinds for the whole industry.” He closed with an explicit price target for the next cycle, acknowledging he was “going out on a limb”: “I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000 December 23rd—or December 31st—2026.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.15.

Title: Crypto bounces as the macro market remains uncertain: Will it sustain?

A sustained growth in spot demand and OI is necessary to drive the next rally. The crypto market saw a 10.4% bounce in total market capitalization since the swift price drop in the early hours of Monday. Bitcoin [BTC] led the charge, gaining 10.55%. Some altcoins have posted greater returns. The U.S. government reopened on the 13th of November, after a 43-day pause. This threw a monkey wrench into the machinery, as the market was missing some key information. Some reports were being released. For example, on Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said that private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November. In contrast, economists expected an increase of 40,000 jobs. On the bright side, the Federal Reserve officially ended its quantitative tightening (QT). The stock market also had a positive performance on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.3% for the day. The Bank of America and BlackRock asserted that the AI boom was driven by real corporate investment, and not irrational exuberance that drove the dot-com bubble. The current environment was described as more of an “air pocket” than a bubble by Bank of America’s head of equity and research. These developments showed that the already volatile crypto-sphere was being tugged at in different directions by the indecisive macro conditions as well. Source: TOTAL on TradingView The total crypto market cap fell below $3.56 trillion, a key support level, in September. It continued to trend downward, but something interesting happened over the past two weeks. The trendline support (yellow) from November 2023 was breached in November. The retest of the same level as resistance, surprisingly, did not reject the total market cap. It served as support once again in recent days. Perhaps the crypto bounce could continue in the coming weeks. Source: CoinGlass The Open Interest behind Bitcoin has slowly grown over the past three days, but it was still shallow compared to the October highs. A lack of speculative interest showed that market confidence was still low, and bullish bets were not as big as earlier. A sustained growth in spot demand and OI is necessary to drive the next rally. Until then, investors and traders can treat the bounce as a bounce and not expect a full recovery.
