Title: More than 560 trespass incidents on Irish Rail network so far this year

Dublin Majority recorded in the greater Dublin area, latest figures show Irish Rail recorded over 560 cases of illegal access to tracks and stations in the first half of 2025. Pic: Stock image Dozens of people have been fined or prosecuted for trespassing on the Irish Rail network so far this year, with the majority of incidents recorded across the greater Dublin area. Figures released to Kildare North TD Aidan Farrelly reveal that 567 trespass incidents were reported to Irish Rail in the first half of 2025. The data, which includes outcomes for specific incidents, shows trespassing has occurred at key city centre stations – such as Connolly, Pearse, and Lansdowne Road – and commuter hubs including Maynooth, Bray, Blackrock, and Clondalkin/Fonthill. Most adults involved received fixed penalty notices, while in some cases, individuals were prosecuted or convicted in court. At Maynooth, one person was convicted and fined, with additional costs awarded. Several incidents remain unresolved due to those involved being minors, with details unverified or summonses unserved, particularly at locations including Sandymount, Salthill, and Malahide. The figures form part of a broader pattern of offences reported over recent years, with 985 incidents recorded in 2024, down from 1,102 in 2023 and higher figures in previous years. Trespassing on the railway is illegal and highly dangerous, carrying penalties under the Railway Safety Act 2005. Irish Rail has repeatedly warned of the fatal risks posed by people accessing live tracks or infrastructure without authorisation. A person who trespasses on railways is now liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,000, subject to increase under the Fines Act. Mr Farrelly, who requested the data, highlighted the concentration of offences within the greater Dublin area, but welcomed the overall decline. “These statistics suggest that the bulk of offences are happening within the greater Dublin transport network,” he said. “We appear to be seeing a declining trend in relation to trespassing, which is welcome. “It also appears that for those under age 16, it has been decided to inform parents/guardians rather than use statutory powers to sanction, which I believe to be appropriate,” he added. Concerns persist, however, as trespass-related safety risks remain a serious issue, especially amid ongoing passenger growth and the Dart+ expansion programme. Residents living close to railway infrastructure have previously highlighted safety problems, such as youths throwing rocks from rail viaducts in North Strand last November. Social Democrats councillor Daniel Ennis warned at the time that “someone was going to get killed”, and urged Irish Rail to improve site security and fencing. Irish Rail recorded over 560 cases of illegal access to tracks and stations in the first half of 2025. Pic: Stock image Today's News in 90 seconds - 6th August 2025 At the time, Irish Rail responded to the query, saying there was a “24-hour monitoring station continuously in place” and “repeated checks to Iarnród Éireann’s boundaries”. “Our Crime Prevention Officer has alerted An Garda Síochána and we are liaising with them to arrange additional patrols,” a spokesperson for Irish Rail said. “All train drivers are to report sightings of trespass, and our regional team will respond upon alerts. “Iarnród Éireann staff will continue to liaise with the community in these areas and will promptly address any breaches of boundary fencing or any incidents of trespass, and liaise with gardaí,” they added. Irish Rail and the Department of Transport have been contacted for comment. This article was amended at 10.45am on August 6, 2025, to correct TD Aidan Farrelly’s constituency as Kildare North A man who threatened gardaí, “I’ll fight you, I’ll take another round”, when they found him drunk outside a football club had been attacked by someone earlier, his defence said.

As AIB and others push teams towards in-person working, management may be missing the point Are employers who are pushing for the return to office just blind to the difficulties in-person working presents? Photo: Getty I’m never surprised when I see company bosses and top-tier management try to make a case for returning employees to offices full-time, or for mandatory days where hybrid workers must attend. They enjoy a bustling office with them starring as the ringmaster. And it’s usually easy for them to be there. Imagine large city-centre offices in Dublin, Cork or Galway. The boss usually lives nearby in a place like Ballsbridge, Blackrock or Salthill. They often have a handy parking space for their company car right outside the door or, failing that, can afford convenient commercial parking. They don’t have to worry about being in the traffic, as they can come in whenever suits. They can nip out for a tasty lunch and perhaps even expense it.

They attributed the outflows to investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and a cooling U.S. economy, and remain optimistic that these crypto-focused products will regain momentum, particularly with the likely regulatory approval of new altcoin-based products. “The spot crypto ETPs are benefiting from a one-two punch of macro demand for Bitcoin and regulatory changes that will likely accelerate blockchain adoption,” said Zach Pandl, head of research for crypto fund manager Grayscale. “Both trends should continue in the second half of 2025 and beyond.” He added that the likely approval of staking ETFs could serve as a catalyst to further net inflows. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the decline “a breather,” and said that he remained “bullish long, long term." “I stick to this phrase–two steps forward, one step back,” he said. Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have topped $1.25 billion over the past three days, while their recently torrid Ethereum counterparts have hemorrhaged more than $600 million since last Friday. Ethereum last posted outflows on July 2. It was the first time since a three-day period extending from the end of March into early April that investors simultaneously pulled more assets from both groups of funds than they invested in them on consecutive days. BTC fell below $112,500 at one point, its lowest mark since July 10, although it recovered some ground on Tuesday. ETH sank to $3,380, its lowest level since the middle of the month. Pandl noted that “there was evidence of froth in global markets in late July, including a surge in meme stock trading, high volumes in penny stocks, and tight credit spreads.” “Signs of slower growth in the U.S. economy cooled investor enthusiasm and triggered the latest drawdown across assets,” he said. The two largest crypto assets have been declining since last week, following a cooler-than-expected jobs report, the firing of the head of the government agency that compiles this data, and a fresh escalation of the Trump administration’s global trade war. But Pandl said that the crypto exchange traded product outflows are consistent with pullbacks in financial markets as a whole and are "comparatively small,” noting that recent outflows of Bitcoin ETPs were around 1% of assets, whereas the highest volume US equity ETF saw around 2% of assets in outflows. Balchunas noted that the funds have received massive investments at an unprecedented pace, so the outflows were small relative to the size of the funds, particularly the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone now manages more than $70 billion in assets (AUM). IBIT recorded 295 million in net outflows over the course of the last two trading days, about 1.5% of the funds it has generated since April 7. “You should tolerate up to 10% and still be a happy camper,” Balchunas said. “These [out]flows are nickel and dime compared to the haul it just took in. You have to anticipate little periods of outflows here and there because there’s people trading it and doing all sorts of stuff. If there’s a little sell off in the equity market that’s going to hit it.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

But as the sun dipped behind the towering skyscrapers, violence erupted. A 27-year-old man, whose name I won't bother mentioning, stepped out of a black BMW he had double-parked near 51st and 52nd Streets. His movements were calm, deliberate. In his hands, he carried an AR-15 rifle. His target was 345 Park Avenue, a tower of wealth and power, housing the offices of Blackstone, the National Football League, and Rudin Management. The idea of chaos here, in this building, felt foreign — until it wasn’t. The shooter made his way into the building lobby, where he shot in the back 36-year-old New York City Police Officer Didarul Islam, whose wife was about to give birth to their third child. The gunman then gunned down a woman hiding behind a pillar, her life taken in an instant. The footage shows him moving with a chilling calm, methodical and relentless. A guard behind a desk became his next victim. Then another man, an NFL employee, was shot and is still in critical condition. The shooter made his way to the elevators, and, strangely, as one opened, a woman stepped out. He let her pass. Why? We’ll never know. But she will likely ask herself that question for the rest of her life. He continued to the 33rd floor, where Rudin is located. There, in the quiet hum of fluorescent lights and the soft chatter of cubicles, he began “to walk the floor, firing as he traveled.” Another victim fell, another family destroyed. And then, in a final act, he turned the rifle on himself. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed that the scene was contained. But the damage was done. Four people were dead: one officer, one security guard, and two civilians. Several more were wounded. As details emerged, we learned more about the gunman’s background. He had driven cross-country from Las Vegas to New York. By trade, he was a security guard at a Las Vegas casino, and he held a concealed carry permit. Yet his history of mental illness, coupled with a backpack full of ammunition, medication, and his clear intent, painted a grim picture. We also learned that his real target was the NFL, not Rudin. The shooter, suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease common in high-contact sports caused by repeated head collisions, blamed the NFL for his condition. He had played football in his youth, but never at the professional level. His note, found on his body after he shot himself, said he wanted his brain studied, to contribute to the understanding of his condition. This wasn’t just an ordinary act of violence; it was a tragic collision of a mentally unstable man and a gun. America is in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis. As I walk through cities like New York, I am confronted by the increasing number of unstable individuals teetering on the brink of violence. Not long ago, my wife and I were walking through Manhattan when a man on a bike circled us, looking me directly in the eye, saying, “I’m going to kill me a white man today. Today is the day.” Michael M. Santiago / Staff | Getty Images The man was clearly unhinged. Fortunately, he noticed the armed security behind us, and he quickly rode away. But what if they hadn’t been there? What if he had been someone who wasn’t aware of the people around him? The world we live in today is one where violence is erupting in public spaces, fueled by mental illness, societal breakdown, and a lack of accountability — and it’s becoming a national trend. This isn’t just about guns or laws — it’s about what’s happening inside the minds of those who perpetrate these acts. It’s easy for people to point fingers. To blame social media, to blame the media itself, to call for more laws. But this crisis is about much more than that. It’s about a loss of morality, family, social cohesion, transcendent purpose, genuine human connection, and so much more that comes with a society whose values are rooted in God’s truth. I’m not a mental health expert, but surely the degeneration of these social goods and the historic rise in mental disorders, especially among young people, are not coincidental. We can’t keep turning a blind eye to such things and pretend that new laws or more regulations will fix it. This isn’t just about changing laws; it’s about changing hearts. If we don’t, we’ll keep losing those we hold dear. WRITER While the media obsesses over elite scandals, Glenn is having a field day exposing the Macron lawsuit farce—and the twisted truth it tries to bury. On his show, Glenn couldn't hide his glee over French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte suing Candace Owens for claiming she's really a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux. Glenn called Brigitte the "Jeffrey Epstein of France" for grooming a 15-year-old Emmanuel when she was his 40-year-old teacher, and speculated that she is pressuring her husband to silence the rumors. Glenn also mocked the blatant overkill, which included childhood photos, birth announcements, and a desperate proclamation that Brigitte is "a woman." But it goes deeper: The liberal elites have long proclaimed that transitioning is "wonderful," so why sue over the insinuation? It's hypocrisy—elites demanding silence on grooming while forcing conformity. This isn't about truth; it's control, proving no one's above scrutiny. Want to see the absurd lawsuit firsthand?

WRITER The following oversight report from the House Intelligence Committee examines the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) rushed out by the Obama administration before leaving office in January 2017. The House Intelligence Committee’s review began in 2017, shortly after the ICA’s release, and continued through 2020, paralleling a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election, which concluded in fall 2020. Before its declassification by President Trump and public release by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, this report was among the U.S. government’s most highly classified documents. Its sensitive level of compartmentation prohibited storage on top-secret computer networks. Only five physical copies existed, all secured in safes under strict protocols. This extreme classification suggests the Obama administration sought to prevent the public from learning the extent of its alleged deception. Download the PDF here. CEO/Founder Something ugly is unfolding on social media, and most people aren’t seeing it clearly. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) — one of the most constitutionally grounded conservatives in Washington — is under fire for a housing provision he first proposed in 2022. You wouldn’t know that from scrolling through X. According to the latest online frenzy, Lee wants to sell off national parks, bulldoze public lands, gut hunting and fishing rights, and hand America’s wilderness to Amazon, BlackRock, and the Chinese Communist Party. None of that is true. I covered this last month. Since then, the backlash has grown into something like a political witch hunt — not just from the left but from the right. Even Donald Trump Jr., someone I typically agree with, has attacked Lee’s proposal. He’s not alone. Time to look at the facts the media refuses to cover about Lee’s federal land plan. Over the weekend, Lee announced that he would withdraw the federal land sale provision from his housing bill. He said the decision was in response to “a tremendous amount of misinformation — and in some cases, outright lies,” but also acknowledged that many Americans brought forward sincere, thoughtful concerns. Because of the strict rules surrounding the budget reconciliation process, Lee couldn’t secure legally enforceable protections to ensure that the land would be made available “only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests.” Without those safeguards, he chose to walk it back. That’s not selling out. That’s leadership. It's what the legislative process is supposed to look like: A senator proposes a bill, the people respond, and the lawmaker listens. That was once known as representative democracy. These days, it gets you labeled a globalist sellout. To many Americans, “public land” brings to mind open spaces for hunting, fishing, hiking, and recreation. But that’s not what Sen. Mike Lee’s bill targeted. His proposal would have protected against the real land-grab already under way — the one pushed by the Biden administration. In 2021, Biden launched a plan to “conserve” 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030. This effort follows the United Nations-backed “30 by 30” initiative, which seeks to place one-third of all land and water under government control. Ask yourself: Is the U.N. focused on preserving your right to hunt and fish? Or are radical environmentalists exploiting climate fears to restrict your access to American land? Smith Collection/Gado / Contributor | Getty Images As it stands, the federal government already owns 640 million acres — nearly one-third of the entire country. At this rate, the government will hit that 30% benchmark with ease. But it doesn’t end there. The next phase is already in play: the “50 by 50” agenda. That brings me to a piece of legislation most Americans haven’t even heard of: the Sustains Act. Passed in 2023, the law allows the federal government to accept private funding from organizations, such as BlackRock or the Bill Gates Foundation, to support “conservation programs.” In practice, the law enables wealthy elites to buy influence over how American land is used and managed. Moreover, the government doesn’t even need the landowner’s permission to declare that your property contributes to “pollination,” or “photosynthesis,” or “air quality” — and then regulate it accordingly. You could wake up one morning and find out that the land you own no longer belongs to you in any meaningful sense. Where was the outrage then? Where were the online crusaders when private capital and federal bureaucrats teamed up to quietly erode private property rights across America? The real danger isn’t in Mike Lee’s attempt to offer more housing near population centers — land that would be limited, clarified, and safeguarded in the final bill. The real threat is the creeping partnership between unelected global elites and our own government, a partnership designed to consolidate land, control rural development, and keep Americans penned in so-called “15-minute cities.” BlackRock buying entire neighborhoods and pricing out regular families isn’t by accident. It’s part of a larger strategy to centralize populations into manageable zones, where cars are unnecessary, rural living is unaffordable, and every facet of life is tracked, regulated, and optimized. That’s the real agenda. And it’s already happening , and Mike Lee’s bill would have been an effort to ensure that you — not BlackRock, not China — get first dibs. I live in a town of 451 people. Even here, in the middle of nowhere, housing is unaffordable. The American dream of owning a patch of land is slipping away, not because of one proposal from a constitutional conservative, but because global powers and their political allies are already devouring it. This controversy isn’t really about Mike Lee. It’s about whether we, as a nation, are still capable of having honest debates about public policy — or whether the online mob now controls the narrative. It’s about whether conservatives will focus on facts or fall into the trap of friendly fire and circular firing squads. More importantly, it’s about whether we’ll recognize the real land-grab happening in our country — and have the courage to fight back before it’s too late. This article originally appeared on TheBlaze.com. WRITER By now, many of us are familiar with AI and its potential benefits and threats. However, unless you're a tech tycoon, it can feel like you have little influence over the future of artificial intelligence. He acknowledges their significant benefits but emphasizes the need to establish proper boundaries and ethics now, while we still have control. But since most people aren’t Silicon Valley tech leaders making the decisions, how can they help keep AI in check? Recently, Glenn interviewed Tristan Harris, a tech ethicist deeply concerned about the potential harm of unchecked AI, to discuss its societal implications. Harris highlighted a concerning new piece of legislation proposed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz. This legislation proposes a state-level moratorium on AI regulation, meaning only the federal government could regulate AI. Harris noted that there’s currently no Federal plan for regulating AI. Until the federal government establishes a plan, tech companies would have nearly free rein with their AI. And we all know how slowly the federal government moves. This is where you come in. Tristan Harris shared with Glenn the top five actions you should urge your representatives to take regarding AI, including opposing the moratorium until a concrete plan is in place. Now is your chance to influence the future of AI. Contact your senator and congressman today and share these five crucial steps they must take to keep AI in check: Ban engagement-optimized AI companions for kids Create legislation that will prevent AI from being designed to maximize addiction, sexualization, flattery, and attachment disorders, and to protect young people’s mental health and ability to form real-life friendships. Establish basic liability laws Companies need to be held accountable when their products cause real-world harm. Pass increased whistleblower protections Protect concerned technologists working inside the AI labs from facing untenable pressures and threats that prevent them from warning the public when the AI rollout is unsafe or crosses dangerous red lines. Prevent AI from having legal rights Enact laws so AIs don’t have protected speech or have their own bank accounts, making sure our legal system works for human interests over AI interests. Oppose the state moratorium on AI Call your congressman or Senator Cruz’s office, and demand they oppose the state moratorium on AI without a plan for how we will set guardrails for this technology.

Title: Bitcoin’s $404 mln outflows vs. Ethereum’s 15-week inflow streak: What’s going on?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-404-mln-outflows-vs-ethereums-15-week-inflow-streak-whats-going-on/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T19:00:48Z
Full Content:
Will Fed policy continue to trigger sell-offs? Digital assets saw $223 million in outflows, ending a 14-week streak. Bitcoin bore the brunt, while Ethereum continued to attract inflows. Digital asset investment products recorded $223 million in net outflows during the week ending the 2nd of August, the first pullback after 14 straight weeks of inflows. Source: CoinShares The week began strong with $883 million in inflows, but investor sentiment shifted quickly as the total crypto market cap fell 9.48%, erasing approximately $370 billion. The trigger? A hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve tone. The sell-off was triggered by U.S. investors reacting to a hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, which stated that, “Inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Following the report, U.S. investors offloaded $383 million worth of digital asset products, pushing the month-to-date outflow to $974 million, just shy of the $1 billion mark. Investors from Germany, Sweden, and Brazil also contributed to the sell-off, collectively dumping $81 million worth of crypto products. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin [BTC] accounted for the bulk of outflows, recording $404 million in net losses, almost halving its month-to-date outflow of $844 million. Sui [SUI] and Litecoin [LTC] saw relatively minor outflows of just $1 million each. Ethereum [ETH], on the other hand, remained an outlier. It recorded its 15th consecutive week of inflows, adding $133.9 million, suggesting a shift in investor preference toward Ethereum over Bitcoin. Meanwhile, investor interest in Solana [SOL], Ripple [XRP], and Cardano [ADA] added another $41 million in cumulative inflows. While most institutional investors exited their Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) positions, BlackRock took the opposite approach. The firm’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum iShares ETFs recorded inflows of $355.3 million and $394.2 million, respectively, suggesting that BlackRock views both assets as trading at a discount. However, the wider institutional sentiment didn’t mirror this move. The week began with a significant sell-off. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass, $323.5 million worth of Bitcoin spot ETFs were sold in the past day alone. The Ethereum spot ETF segment saw an even steeper withdrawal—its single-largest one-day outflow yet. Continued selling pressure like this signals a broad divestment trend that could weigh on the prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, the market’s longer-term outlook remains intact. The total assets under management (AUM) for digital asset products remain steady at $215 billion, suggesting that this could be a temporary pullback rather than a long-term reversal.

The world’s largest asset manager has deposited hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) into Coinbase Prime, on-chain data shows. According to the blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain, BlackRock recently moved massive amounts of ETH and BTC worth a combined $664 million to the top US crypto platform as Trump’s latest tariff policies and new US jobs data have sparked market volatility. “BlackRock (ETHA) deposited 101,975 ETH ($372 million) and 2,544 BTC ($292 million) into Coinbase Prime [Tuesday].” The on-chain data indicate that the assets are from BlackRock’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and its Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). It’s unclear the reason for the transfers, but it may indicate an intention to sell on behalf of clients. BlackRock uses Coinbase Prime for custody, sales and other services. The asset manager moved the Bitcoin in batches of 300 BTC and it moved Ethereum in multiple 10,000 ETH transactions. Meanwhile, Lookonchain reports institutional accumulation sprees of Ethereum have been surging. “Whales/institutions keep buying ETH! Another three fresh wallets bought 63,837 ETH ($236 million) via FalconX and Galaxy Digital OTC (over the counter) [Monday]. Since July 9th, a total of 14 fresh wallets have accumulated 856,554 ETH ($3.16 billion).” Lookonchain also notices ETH Treasury firm SharpLink added more Ethereum to its books this week. “SharpLink bought another 18,680 ETH ($66.63 million) [Monday]. SharpLink currently holds 498,711 ETH ($1.81 billion).” Bitcoin is trading for $113,012 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $3,578 at time of writing, down 2.2% on the day.

Title: Peter Thiel-backed Bullish IPO may hit $4.2B valuation: Will it match Circle’s breakout?

Bullish wants to go public. But its timing, partners and ambitions reveal something much bigger! Crypto exchange Bullish has filed for a $629 million IPO at a $4.2 billion valuation. This has piqued the interest of BlackRock and ARK, who may buy $200 million worth of shares. Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, has officially entered the IPO arena with the filing of its F-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to offer 20.3 million ordinary shares at a price range of $28 to $31, potentially raising up to $629 million. If fully subscribed, the IPO could value the firm between $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion. The filing follows Bullish’s earlier confidential submission in June, a common route that allows firms to quietly prepare for listing while keeping key financials under wraps until the final stages. Bullish’s IPO push, with JPMorgan and Jefferies as lead underwriters, comes at a time when digital assets are regaining momentum and investor sentiment is shifting positively. This also aligns with Circle Internet Group’s impressive public debut, where shares of the USDC stablecoin issuer soared over 500%, highlighting growing market appetite for crypto firms. Bullish appears to be capitalizing on this momentum, kicking off its IPO roadshow shortly after the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act. This newly introduced but still untested law offers clearer regulatory pathways for stablecoin issuers. CEO Tom Farley addressed this backdrop in a letter included with the filing, saying, “We now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth. We view transparency and compliance as hallmarks of how we operate Bullish, and believe those values align well with the public capital markets.” Major investment firms like BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have expressed interest in buying up to $200 million of Bullish shares, according to the updated F-1 filing. The Bullish IPO is part of a broader wave of ambitions in crypto. Major exchanges like OKX, Kraken, and Gemini are also signaling readiness to go public, with Gemini having already submitted a confidential filing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] maxi Michael Saylor continues to double down on his crypto thesis through his firm Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy) via a Wall Street IPO to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ This arrangement, announced in a news release Tuesday (Aug.) will see funds and accounts managed by BlackRock advisors invest up to $1 billion through LendingClub’s marketplace programs through next year. Clarke Roberts, senior vice president and general manager for Marketplace at LendingClub, called the partnership “an exciting step forward” for his company. “It also validates the strength of our underwriting, the effectiveness of our marketplace programs, and the trust we’ve earned as a counterparty of choice in this asset class,” Roberts said in the release. “We want to thank BlackRock for their collaboration and execution, and we look forward to growing this partnership over time.” This collaboration comes on the heels of BlackRock’s first transaction of $100 million under LendingClub’s new LENDR (LendingClub Rated Notes) program, which closed in June. LENDR offers “multiple tranches, each with a credit rating from Fitch,” the release added. Under the June transaction with BlackRock, all tranches were sold to funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. In all, LendingClub has sold close to $6 billion in loans through its structured certificates programs since their launch in 2023. PYMNTS spoke in June with LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn, who argued that as high-income Americans struggle with debt, the solution is rewarding people for using the money they actually have rather than extending more credit. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster as LendingClub introduced its LevelUp Checking service. That program offers customers 2% cash back for on-time loan payments made from the account and 1% cash back when using the associated debit card for qualifying purchases. As that report noted, the reliance on credit is not confined to lower-income brackets, as illustrated by LendingClub’s target customer for LevelUp Checking. These are people individuals with a high FICO score, typically around 725, and a higher-than-average individual income, somewhere in the range of $125,000 to $130,000. “These consumers often have enough money to afford things but lack the immediate cash to pay for them outright,” Sanborn said, making them more likely to carry larger-than-average car loans, student loans, mortgages and significant credit card debt. During an earnings call last week, Sanborn said that LevelUp Checking had driven a six-fold increase in the number of checking accounts opened each day since its launch in June.

Says Hitesh Sethia, CEO, JFS, “At the heart of our model is a future-ready and scalable technology stack, powered by data analytics and artificial intelligence. It enables us to deliver personalised financial solutions at scale with cost efficiency and precision. Our integrated data infrastructure and intelligence engine help us deliver the right product to the right customer at the right time and through the right channel.” The centrepiece of JFS’s operating model is the JioFinance app, he says. Designed to appeal to users of all generations, the app saw over 4 million downloads as of March 31, 2025. Across the JioFinance and MyJio apps, JFS catered to 8 million monthly active users in March 2025. Jio Credit, JFS’s lending arm, saw its assets under management grow from ₹173 crore at the end of FY24 to ₹10,053 crore as on March 31, 2025. It offers home loans, loans against property, mutual funds, shares, supply chain and finance solutions. Jio Payment Solutions (JPS) strengthened its merchant network and received the online payment aggregator licence from the RBI. JFS’s insurance distribution arm, Jio Insurance Broking (JIB), made tie-ups with 34 insurers and offers 61 plans. In FY25, JIB generated a total premium collection of ₹900 crore through 1.81 million policies issued. “In asset and wealth management, our joint venture (JV) with BlackRock combines our digital reach and deep understanding of the Indian market with BlackRock’s global investment management capabilities. During the year, we received in-principle SEBI approval for the asset management business and filed for licenses to operate wealth management and broking businesses,” Sethia said. K.V. Kamath, chairman, JFS, said new branches of AI, such as Agentic AI, which is capable of autonomous action and decision-making, holds immense potential to define the future of this industry. “At Jio Financial Services, we are committed to leveraging new technology as a force for good by simplifying financial services and expanding access. By embracing technology, Jio Financial Services is uniquely positioned to become a premier financial services enterprise, catering to the evolving aspirations of our customers,” he said.

For most of my career, when asked to speak to high school students or incoming first-year college students and give them career advice, I mostly steered them towards a career in technology. I would talk about how I saw tech jobs driving the future, especially in IT, programming, security, and areas that would be important to tech infrastructure. Looking back, given that today AI has threatened the jobs of millions of white-collar tech workers, I should have also recommended another option that looks like perhaps a safer bet: blue-collar jobs. When I was in high school in the late 1960s, one of the more interesting programs offered separate trade school specialties. My high school provided programs for auto repair, electricians, HVAC, and plumbing. At the time, as a certified geek, I did not appreciate these programs in my high school and their potential as a significant career opportunity for many in my class. But decades of watching manufacturing jobs disappear overseas and being told the future belonged to knowledge workers, America's blue-collar workforce may be one of the safest careers to have. As artificial intelligence threatens to automate away millions of white-collar positions, the very trades that were once dismissed as "dead-end jobs" are emerging as the economy's most recession-proof careers. While ChatGPT can write code, analyze spreadsheets, and even draft legal briefs, it can’t fix your broken air conditioner on a sweltering August afternoon or rewire the electrical systems that power our AI-driven economy. As a homeowner, I have come to appreciate the skills of plumbers, electricians, and other blue-collar workers I call on often for various issues, such as replacing my water heater, drainage problems, and roof leaks.In my teen years, I worked on cars and even took a dedicated auto class. But today, if my car has a problem, I go to a skilled mechanic to fix any issue that arises. A recent Microsoft analysis examining AI-resistant jobs reveals the scope of this economic reversal. The 40 most vulnerable occupations—translators, historians, sales representatives, and other desk-bound professionals—employ roughly 11 million Americans. Meanwhile, the 40 least vulnerable positions—heavy equipment operators, roofers, electricians, and similar hands-on roles—currently employ about 5.5 million workers. Mike Rowe, the "Dirty Jobs" host, captured this shift perfectly at a recent AI summit: “We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to code. 'Learn to code!’ we said. Yeah, well, AI's coming for the coders. They're not coming for the welders. They're not coming for the plumbers.” The irony of our AI revolution is that it requires massive physical infrastructure that only human hands can build and maintain. Every AI query runs on servers housed in data centers that need electricians, HVAC technicians, and construction workers. I once went into a central server farm in Oregon that needed massive air conditioning to cool the hundreds of servers running 24/7. The more we automate knowledge work, the more we need skilled tradespeople to keep the digital economy running. Companies are already boasting about saving hundreds of millions annually by replacing human workers with AI. But these companies also need the wiring for their new data centers or maintaining the cooling systems that prevent their AI servers from overheating, and they will acknowledge that they need these blue-collar workers to make that happen. The AI boom will only intensify this crunch as demand for data center construction and maintenance skyrockets. We will also need millions of people to manage these manufacturing lines in the future. A recent NPR article points out that the Manufacturing Institute (the NAM’s workforce development and education affiliate) and Deloitte, a consultancy firm, surveyed more than 200 manufacturing companies last year. More than 65% of the firms said recruiting and retaining workers was their No. 1 business challenge," NPR noted. "The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte projected that the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033 and that as many as '1.9 million of these jobs could go unfilled if workforce challenges are not addressed.'" I believe there needs to be a reimagining of the workforce development. Programs like the Manufacturing Institute’s maintenance technician training, now operating in 16 states, show what’s possible. Early graduates average an income of $95,000 annually within five years—compensation that rivals many traditional white-collar careers without the student debt burden. The world is learning in real time that AI is a transformational technology that brings with it new needs, particularly when it comes to U.S. infrastructure and our electrical grid. America might not be producing enough electricians to build and service the data centers that power AI. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says he has "told the members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough." These centers are a critical part of building America's leadership in AI. For decades, American culture has pushed college as the only path to middle-class prosperity while stigmatizing manual labor as somehow lesser work. This cultural bias persists even as plumbers and electricians often out-earn college graduates saddled with student loans. The AI revolution may finally force a long-overdue reckoning with these assumptions. When artificial intelligence can write legal briefs but can't unclog a drain, maybe it's time to reconsider which skills are truly valuable in the modern economy. One big question asked of tech CEOs is whether they are willing to help retrain many of their tech workers who will lose jobs to AI. As of now, I have seen no dedicated programs coming from tech companies that offer any transitional programs, especially towards blue-collar careers that could be just as lucrative as the white collar programs today. I suspect this transition won’t happen automatically. It requires coordinated effort from employers, educational institutions, and policymakers to create pathways for mid-career workers displaced by AI to retrain for skilled trades. The infrastructure exists—apprenticeship programs, community college partnerships, and industry training initiatives—but it needs to be massively scaled. As artificial intelligence transforms the American workforce, one truth is emerging: the future will favor not those who mimic machines, but those who offer what machines can't—deeply human skills. In a world racing toward automation, this is a powerful reminder that some roles still demand the irreplaceable human touch.

Title: Viral RNA-Based Sprays For Plants Have Unknown Consequences

A Masterstroke of Economic and Geopolitical Brilliance by Rhoda Wilson | Aug 5, 2025 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at Natural News. Terrana Biosciences is on a mission to replace pesticides with its RNA-based sprays as “vaccines” for plants to protect crops from pests and diseases. The RNA is taken from plant viruses. Terrana claims its sprays do not alter the plant genome and merely deliver RNA into plants to stimulate an immune response or produce protective proteins. But in reality, they don’t know, as there have been no long-term safety studies. The company describes its products as: “Terrana sources native RNAs from across the plant world and gives them new instructions to make any desired trait and solve for problems at any point in the plant’s lifecycle,” which indicates their true aim. Michelle Perro explains why Terrana’s sprays are risky, very risky, for people and the environment. RNA sprays are more dangerous than GMO crops, she says. Related: The architects of Moderna’s mRNA shots are plotting to spray RNA on your food, Natural News. 25 July 202 Terrana Biosciences was launched by the venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering on 1 July 2025. At the end of July, reports were circulating that the company had received approval to spray synthetic RNA onto American food crops. The reports (for example, see HERE and HERE) don’t provide their sources for the approval, so we haven’t been able to verify these claims. However, in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) approved ledprona, a sprayable double-stranded ribonucleic acid pesticide. Marketed as Calantha, which uses ledprona as its active ingredient, the RNA interference (“RNAi”) pesticide was developed by GreenLight Biosciences. Perhaps the July reports are conflating the launch of Terrana Biosciences and the approval of GreenLight’s RNA products? Regardless, the whole agenda of replacing chemicals with RNA products is nefarious. Table of Contents GreenLight Biosciences, founded in 2008 and based in Massachusetts, is a biotechnology company that uses RNA technology to develop sustainable solutions for agriculture and human health. “In Rochester, New York, we are operating the world’s largest RNA factory,” the company boasts. It has received US regulatory approval to sell its RNAi pesticide for the Colorado potato beetle, Calantha, and is awaiting approval for Norroa, an RNAi product to “protect honeybees” from varroa mites. In December 2024, GreenLight announced the establishment of GreenLight Biosciences México, S. de R.L. de C.V., expanding its operations to Brazil and Mexico. “Among the innovative technologies to be introduced are a novel adjuvant that improves crop protection performance and Norroa,” the company said. This year, GreenLight has received substantial funding. In March 2025, the company announced a $25 million investment from Just Climate. Just Climate was established in 2021 by Generation Investment Management as a “specialist investment business focused on scaling solutions for the highest-emitting, most off-track sectors of the economy.” Generation Investment Management is an investment management firm founded in 2004 by former US Vice President Al Gore and former Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management head David Blood, along with five other partners. According to a report in 2017, the company had US$18 billion under management and was based in London with an office in San Francisco. At the time, the company employed 100 people. According to Wikipedia, it has partnerships with the following: “[Just Climate’s] investment enables the company to continue its expansion across key international markets, including Brazil and other Latin American countries. Recent expansion efforts include the establishment of a state-of-the-art Agricultural Research Station in Seville, Spain, which now serves as the Company’s European hub for innovation and collaborative research in sustainable agriculture practices,” GreenLight Biosciences said. In February 2025, the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) provided a €35 million loan to GreenLight Biosciences Spain to “support research and production of ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)-based biocontrols.” RNAi-based “biocontrols” (i.e. pesticides) “constitute a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical pesticides,” EIB said. Adding, “The EIB loan will support GreenLight Bio’s RDI programmes associated with the research, registration, and production of a pipeline of ten products to be launched in the EU … The loan will also finance the research and innovation centre of Greenlight Biosciences in Seville, Spain.” Now read the Globalist propaganda GreenLight uses to push its gene editing products. Note the use of the phrase “nature-based pest control” and “environmentally friendly.” It is an outright lie to claim that gene manipulation is “nature-based” or “environmentally friendly.” “At GreenLight Biosciences, we believe that providing farmers with nature-based pest control solutions is key to building a more sustainable and resilient food supply chain. Our platform is not only environmentally friendly but also offers farmers an effective and safe alternative to traditional pesticides,” stated GreenLight Biosciences Chief Strategy Officer & co-founder Marta Ortega-Valle. “With the support of the European Investment Bank, we can expand our efforts to bring these innovative solutions to farmers across Europe.” Spain: EIB finances GreenLight Biosciences with €35 million to invest in research and production of RNA-based biological pesticides, European Investment Bank, 3 February 2025 According to the company profile on Investing, GreenLight Biosciences is also involved in human health, with “a phase I/II preclinical stage vaccine for COVID-19 and candidate selection vaccines for shingles and oncology.” We previously noted Flagship Pioneering in our article ‘UK’s plan to be a “science and technology superpower” progresses; dystopia looms’. In this article, we quoted a Department for Science, Innovation & Technology policy paper which said: US Venture Capital firm Flagship Pioneering announced its strategic commitment to the UK life sciences ecosystem in 2023 and established its first base outside of the US in London. This was marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UK government … This commitment was combined with Flagship’s milestone launch of Quotient Therapeutics, the first Flagship-founded company co-anchored in the UK and US. Innovation, investment and growth in life sciences – applying the Science and Technology Framework to one of the UK’s strongest sectors, The UK Science and Technology Framework: update on progress (9 February 2024), Department for Science, Innovation & Technology, 9 February 2024 In our 2021 article ‘Building an Empire – The United Nations Using the World Economic Forum to Roll Out Its Agenda’, we noted that “the top institutional shareholders of Moderna are Baillie Gifford & Company, and Flagship Pioneering Inc. (founded by Noubar Afeyan) followed by Vanguard, Blackrock and Morgan Stanley.” In an article last year, ‘Moderna’s influence over the US and UK governments is more than most realise’, we noted: “Flagship Pioneering are a venture capital firm that financed and kickstarted Moderna. The CEO of Flagship Pioneering, Noubar Afeyan, also co-founded Moderna. So, they’re essentially one and the same.” Wikispooks notes that “after Noubar Afeyan and Robert Langer, [Stéphane] Bancel is the largest individual shareholder in [Moderna].” So, who is Flagship Pioneering? Founded in 1999 by Noubar Afeyan and Ed Kania under the name NewcoGen, it was later renamed Flagship Ventures and then Flagship Pioneering in 2016. The company has originated and fostered more than 100 companies since its launch in 2000, resulting in over $60 billion in aggregate value. According to its LinkedIn profile, “The current Flagship ecosystem comprises over 40 companies.” You can see a list of these companies HERE, one of which is Moderna. In 2023, Flagship Pioneering established its first European base in London, marking a significant expansion into the UK life sciences sector. This move was followed by the launch of Quotient Therapeutics. At the beginning of this year, Flagship Pioneering partnered with Cambridge University Health Partners (“CUHP”) and the Milner Therapeutics Institute (MTI) to accelerate biotech research and innovation in the UK. You can see a list of Flagship’s numerous partners HERE, including ThermoFisher, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and GSK. In 2025, Flagship unveiled Terrana Biosciences. Forbes reported in 2021 that founder Noubar Afeyan owns at least 75% of Flagship Pioneering. By Michelle Perro, MD, as published by GMO Science on 31 July 2025 Terrana Biosciences, launched by Flagship Pioneering, the creator of Moderna, received a $50 million initial investment and government approval for experimental-use authorisations, raising ethical and public health alarms. The company pioneers RNA-based agricultural traits throughout a “proprietary technology platform.” The company claims that their approach will empower farmers with “… precise, adaptive solutions to combat threats to crops in fields and orchards and enhance resiliency, sustainability, and productivity in the global food system.” Is this an incredible breakthrough or more of the same rhetoric that we endured and heard spouted with genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) that turned out to be an environmental and health disaster? Instead of modifying DNA, Terrana’s spray-on RNA platform delivers engineered RNA molecules through tiny tears in plant leaves; these enter plant cells, replicate and can express proteins such as viral antigens, insecticidal Cry toxins, or climate‑resilience genes designed to act as programmable plant vaccines. Thus, Terrana will use RNA from plant viruses as a chassis to carry pieces of “cargo RNA” into a plant to help it fight infections and insects, and deliver vaccines. The CEO of Terrana (and a Flagship partner), Ryan Rapp, says we should think of this “… like software. You can stick a floppy disk or USB drive into the computer and give it a set of instructions. This is the first time we’ve had a platform where we can actually do this in plants”. Terrana CEO Ryan Rapp: “We are giving humanity this other tool as we start to deal with climate change to help us deal with the effects on food supply and production.” ‘There are so many things we can do with this’… Terrana Biosciences to unleash RNA-based crop protection, Ag Tech Navigator, 3 July 2025 Kids aren’t software updates! Keep synthetic RNA off their plates. The approach by Terrana differs from those using RNA interference (“RNAi”) on crops. The EPA gave the green light to farmers in 2024 to use an RNAi insecticide from GreenLight Biosciences. When consumed by beetles, the RNA silences their survival gene. RNA sprays are deployed without long-term safety data on human exposure, children, or immune and reproductive effects. The technology remains unlabelled, and liability protections are in place under experimental regulatory frameworks. Terrana’s products fall under experimental authorisation, meaning neither Terrana nor government agencies bear liability for adverse outcomes. There is no mandatory labelling, so consumers cannot give informed consent or opt out. RNA molecules entering human food supplies may alter gut-associated lymphoid tissue (“GALT”), raising unknown immunological consequences in children. Repeat exposure could disrupt hormonal signalling, endocrine pathways or even transgenerational development (affecting our offspring), given RNA’s potential systemic persistence. Terrana claims some RNA constructs may be heritable across plant generations, raising an alarm about unintentional spread across species and ecosystems. This uncontrolled gene expression mirrors historically what we have witnessed with GMOs, only magnified by a sprayable, replicable system. The fight against GMOs has been an uphill battle, with industry and regulatory agencies suppressing public awareness despite mounting and censored scientific evidence of harm. This is the same pattern of secrecy and dismissal now repeating itself with the untested, unlabelled RNA spray technology being pushed onto our food and environment. The EPA has already approved RNA-based applications such as GreenLight’s RNAi spray in 2024. Terrana’s RNA is more advanced: it enters the plant interior and replicates, rather than merely coating leaves like earlier RNA sprays. Regulatory agencies have permitted early usage under experimental-use guidance, without labelling mandates and with pre-emption protections, shielding manufacturers from legal accountability. What Could Go Wrong? Terrana’s “software” approach to plants is far more dangerous than traditional GMOs because it bypasses genetic modification and instead reprogrammes plants in real-time, using synthetic RNA sprays that alter gene expression without leaving a clear genetic fingerprint. Unlike GMOs, which underwent lengthy (although faulty and imperfect) regulatory reviews and must be grown from modified seeds, RNA sprays can be applied repeatedly and directly onto crops, meaning gene expression can be continuously manipulated in the field. This creates a moving target for a safety evaluation. Be clear: there is no fixed genome to study, no long-term data, and no labelling for consumers. By treating plants like “computers” to be constantly re-coded, this technology risks unpredictable ripple effects on plant physiology, pollinators, and human health. Traditional GMOs were studied and showed harm, but were ignored by industry and the government. Terrana’s RNA sprays are the next unretrievable experimental, untested at scale, and stunningly released under legal immunity, which makes this approach a vast, uncontrolled genetic experiment in our food system, our health, and our environment. The effects of RNA sprays on our microbiome? Unknown. While Big Ag and Big Tech proponents tout RNA sprays as “climate‑responsive” innovations, the lack of long-term safety studies, the absence of labelling, and legal immunity represent an unchecked genetic experiment. Unlike GMOs subjected to years of oversight and litigation, this new platform bypasses those meagre safeguards entirely. As a physician, I urge readers and policymakers alike to demand transparency, full labelling, independent safety testing, especially assessing impacts on children’s immune and reproductive health, before allowing gene-altering sprays into our food system and environment. Approval? No. Moratorium. Michelle Perro, MD, is a veteran paediatrician with over four decades of experience in acute and integrative medicine, co-founder and CEO of GMOScience. More than fifteen years ago, Dr. Perro transformed her clinical practice to include the health effects of GMOs and their associated pesticides.

Title: BlackRock Leads US Spot Ether ETFs’ Record $465 Million One-Day Bloodbath
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-leads-us-spot-ether-etfs-record-465-million-one-day-bloodbath/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T11:49:46Z

Investors yanked a staggering $465.1 million from spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, marking the biggest one-day outflow since the cohort’s debut last year. The Monday outflows effectively ended their longest inflow streak. The recent run saw record-breaking activity, when the nine spot Ether ETFs trading in the US saw inflows of $2.2 billion in the second week of July, $1.9 billion in the third week, and $154.3 million just last week. BlackRock’s ETHA led Monday’s losses, shedding $375 million, while Fidelity’s FETH followed with a $55.1 million drop, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors. Not a single ETH ETF posted inflows on Monday, with multiple funds remaining flat for the day. Despite the recent outflows, the Ethereum ETFs have still collectively netted $9.02 billion in total inflows. Ethereum was recently trading at around $3,680 at press time as the broader crypto market saw a modest uptick. According to a recent report by Standard Chartered, corporations are now acquiring Ether at twice the rate of Bitcoin. Since the start of June, crypto treasury firms have scooped up approximately 1% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, suggesting a growing institutional appetite for the second-largest cryptocurrency. On Monday, for instance, Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion surpassed $3 billion in Ethereum, making it the largest corporate ETH treasury. According to the company’s official announcement, BitMine now ranks as the third largest public crypto treasury in the world, behind only Michael Saylor’s Strategy and miner Mara Blockchain, which both hold Bitcoin (BTC). BitMine, which aims to control 5% of all Ethereum held or staked, launched its strategy earlier this month. The Nasdaq-listed company said that it has achieved its 833,137 ETH stockpile in just 35 days. Standard Chartered stressed that such accumulation, coupled with steady inflows into US spot Ether ETFs, has been a key catalyst behind Ether’s recent upsurge. The British multinational bank thinks these trends could propel ETH beyond the $4,000 price threshold by year-end. Looking ahead, the bank forecasts that Ethereum treasury companies could eventually own as much as 10% of the entire supply, citing the added benefits of staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) participation.

Title: Saudi Aramco second-quarter net profit drops 22%
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0805/1526941-saudi-aramco-second-quarter-net-profit-drops-22/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T07:46:11Z
Full Content:
Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco reported a 22% drop in second-quarter profit today, mainly on lower revenue, while it racked up more debt. The world's top oil exporter reported a net profit of $22.7 billion in the three months ended June 30, missing a company-provided median estimate from 17 analysts of $23.7 billion. Aramco's average realised crude oil price was $66.7 a barrel in the quarter, down from $85.7 in the second quarter of 2024 and $76.3 in the first quarter of this year. Total borrowing rose to $92.9 billion at June 30 from $74.4 a year prior. Gearing, a measure of indebtedness, rose to 6.5% from minus 0.3% a year earlier and 5.3% the previous quarter. The company, long a cash cow for the Saudi state, confirmed a previously outlined $21.3 billion in total dividends for the second quarter, roughly $200 million of which is performance-linked dividends, a mechanism introduced after a windfall from oil prices in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Aramco in March outlined total dividends of $85.4 billion for 2025 - a 37% drop from its payout of over $124 billion the previous year. The performance-linked component is set to plunge 98% to $900 million as the company's free cash flow dwindles. Free cash flow dropped nearly a fifth year-on-year in the second quarter to $15.2 billion. Reuters reported last month that Aramco is close to a deal to raise around $10 billion in investment from a group led by BlackRock and is considering selling up to five of its gas-powered power plants to raise up to $4 billion, as Riyadh presses the company to increase profit and payout. For the Saudi government, which owns 81.5% of Aramco shares directly and another 16% through its sovereign wealth fund PIF, dividends are a critical source of income, particularly as it spends on efforts to diversify the economy away from oil. Oil generated 62% of the government's revenue last year. The International Monetary fund estimates the kingdom needs oil at more than $90 a barrel to balance its 2025 budget. Global crude benchmark Brent was trading at $68.83 at 0625 GMT. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirms Operation Mockingbirdâs ongoing influence, linking it to CIA tactics weaponizing media and intelligence to undermine President Trump. $900M Biden Propaganda Campaign fueled distrust in the CDC through misleading data on masks, vaccines and child health. Scientists admit psychological tactics â including fear-based manipulation â were employed during the pandemic. Modern Mockingbird Tools include algorithmic censorship, social media surveillance and Big Tech partnerships. Trumpâs Agenda aims to dismantle âDeep Stateâ media propaganda apparatuses, per Gabbard. $900M Biden Propaganda Campaign fueled distrust in the CDC through misleading data on masks, vaccines and child health.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dropped a literary-sized bombshell on American democracy this week, confirming Cold War-era intelligence tactics are now targeting U.S. citizens. The CIAâs infamous Operation Mockingbird â once a tool for influencing foreign and domestic media â is, she says, alive and weaponized to undercut the Trump administration and distort public opinion. In a July 31 interview with conservative host Benny Johnson, Gabbard described intelligence insiders leaking secrets exclusively to âfriendsâ in corporate media, including Fox News and CNN, though their parent companies are owned by globalist-aligned firms like BlackRock (a World Economic Forum partner). âThey believe their will is more important than yours,â Gabbard warned. âWeaponizing public records to sabotage elected leadership is an attack on constitutional order and the American people.â This isnât fringe conspiracyÂ â Gabbard, a former U.S. Congressmember, has official authority to corroborate it.Â Nor is it limited to leaks: Todayâs âMockingbird 2.0â uses artificial intelligence, corporate surveillance and $900 million in federal propaganda funneled into media narratives during Bidenâs pandemic response. "The CDC was a propaganda machine": The $900M truth Gabbardâs warnings align with a 2024 House report that found Bidenâs CDC spent taxpayer money to spread âerroneousâ data during the pandemic. According to the Energy and Commerce Committee, ads exaggerated vaccine efficacy, underplayed childrenâs risks and partnered with Big Tech to monitor Americans. Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said the campaign eroded trust in public health entirely: âThey weaponized fear. Millions believed threats that either lacked evidence or were exaggerated.â Perhaps most alarming: House investigators revealed the CDC distributed messaging that conflicted with FDA authorization â flagrantly violating its role as a regulatory body. Whistleblowers expose fear as a weapon Gabbardâs claims gained credibility when former UK pandemic advisors admitted to exploiting psychological tactics from 2020â2022. A Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group (SPI-B) member told JonFleetwood.com: âFear smacked of totalitarianism.â The groupâs psychologists inflated risks to justify lockdowns, even while knowing public resistance could weaken compliance. One member now calls the program âdystopian,â admitting, âWe handed dictators a playbook.â Modern Mockingbird tools While the original Mockingbird relied on clandestine journalist recruitment, todayâs iteration is digital, mass-scale and taxpayer-funded. Gabbardâs team identified five key mechanisms: Leaked intel narratives: Directed to âloyalâ media for manipulated headlines. AI censorship: Social platforms suppress dissent through algorithmic bias. CDC youth influencers: Funded accounts âtesting the waterâ on experimental drugs. Surveillance partnerships: Tech giants hand over private data under âpublic healthâ mandates. Fear psychology: Campaigns weaponized child vaccination mandates to gin public outrage. The end of the domino theory? Or just the beginning? Operation Mockingbirdâs resurrection serves as a eulogy for the American pressâs perceived independence. The Church Committeeâs 1975 findings âÂ exposing CIA ties with the New York Times, TimeÂ and CBSÂ â were labeled âconspiracy theories.â Now, Gabbard validates its continuation in digital warfare. President Trump tapped Gabbard to dismantle this apparatus, and she insists his election victory was no accident. âThe public sees it,â Gabbard says, âand thatâs why this fight is personal.â The Mockingbird sings for democracy Gabbardâs revelation forces a reckoning: When government agencies use media as propaganda arsenals, democracy dies in darkness. Whether Mockingbirdâs revival is a âcovert programâ or institutionalized overreach, its effects are clear â erosion of trust, facilitated censorship and a public increasingly weaponized against itself. As Harper Leeâs Atticus Finch said, killing innocence mocks the very society that commits it. Tulsi Gabbardâs fight isnât just about accountability. Itâs about preserving journalismâs soul â and democracyâs future.

Title: Energy transition: Waratah Super battery, Australia’s biggest, turns on at Munmorah Power Station site for BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy

One of the most powerful batteries built anywhere in the world has started operating at the site of an old coal-fired power station in New South Wales, delivering a critical boost to the eastern seaboard’s electricity grid as it transitions to cleaner energy sources. United States-based asset giant BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy said on Tuesday it had activated the first batch of capacity from its $1 billion Waratah Super Battery, a project spanning the size of eight Australian rules football fields at the shuttered Munmorah Power Station site on the NSW Central Coast. BlackRock is involved with the Waratah Super Battery in NSW, which will rank among the biggest grid-scale batteries anywhere in the world. The huge storage system would initially work like a “shock absorber” to buffer the network from disruptions caused by events such as lightning strikes or bushfires, the company said. Grid-scale batteries, with response times measured in split seconds, are seen as essential to Australia’s green energy shift because of their ability to soak up surplus renewable output in daylight hours and use it to plug gaps in supply and stabilise the system at times of low wind and sunlight, or during unexpected outages. While the Waratah Super Battery would initially be limited to 350 megawatts, it would reach 850 megawatts with 1680 megawatt hours of storage once it ramped to full capacity, which may be as early as the end of the year, Akaysha said on Tuesday. This would make it the most powerful utility-scale battery in the world, although other larger projects are under construction elsewhere in Australia and globally. Australia is experiencing one of the world’s fastest energy transitions as polluting coal-fired generators, which still supply most of the grid’s electricity, reach the end of their lives, while wind and solar farms are expanding their role in the grid every year. Australians are also world leaders in per-person solar uptake, with more than 4 million homes – or one in three – now fitted with rooftop solar panels. However, all those solar panels are making far too much electricity in the middle of the day when the sun is brightest, and hardly any when the grid needs it most – in the evenings when the sun sets and demand spikes as people arrive home and turn on lights and appliances. To help balance wild swings in supply and demand before the next wave of coal plant closures, Australian governments, utilities and investors are pouring billions of dollars into developing large, flexible battery storage systems across the grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been calling for greater investment in “firming” assets, including batteries and hydroelectric dams, alongside a new fleet of fast-ramping, gas-fired power stations to prepare the grid for a rapidly approaching future without coal. Switching on the Waratah Super Battery was a “win for our grid, and a win for households and businesses”, said Hannah McCaughey, chief executive of NSW government-owned EnergyCo, which is overseeing the project’s delivery. “It will help provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to the people of our state and the national electricity market,” she said. Akaysha Energy chief executive Nick Carter described the start-up of the first 350 megawatts of the Waratah Super Battery as a “major milestone, and a moment of real pride” for the Melbourne-based company, which was bought by BlackRock in 2023. Transgrid, which owns and operates the high-voltage transmission network in NSW, said the Waratah Super Battery had been contracted to provide automated real-time system monitoring services for 36 transmission lines to detect overloading and respond within seconds. “In network contingency events such as lightning strikes, the System Integrity Protection Scheme acts as a shock absorber to return the network to a stable condition and maintain continuity of supply for consumers,” Transgrid general manager Jennifer Hughes said. “It’s like an insurance policy for NSW, and the whole system is triggered automatically, making it fast and reliable in responding to a system event or fault.” The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Bullish IPO 2025 is making headlines as the Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange prepares for a massive $4.2 billion debut on the NYSE. With strong support from Wall Street giants like J.P. Morgan and interest from BlackRock and ARK, Bullish is setting the tone for a new era of institutional crypto investing. The company’s regulatory-compliant model, massive $3B+ asset reserve, and strategy to convert IPO funds into stablecoins make it stand out. Backed by CoinDesk and built for serious traders, Bullish could redefine crypto’s role in traditional finance.

According to the filing, the CoinShares Solana Staking ETF will hold SOL but also stake “a portion” of its holdings, with BitGo set to serve as the fund’s custodian and its staking partner. CoinShares doesn’t specify the likely percentage of the fund’s holdings that will be staked, but it does acknowledge the hypothetical risk that it may “become unable to timely meet excessive redemption requests in amounts that are greater than the portion of the Trust’s SOL that remains un-staked.” Despite this potential risk, the CoinShares Solana Staking ETF joins several similar filings in recent weeks, with the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale and 21Shares all applying to add staking to their existing Ethereum ETFs. Invesco Galaxy has also filed an application for its own Solana staking ETF within the past week, while the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF launched last month after gaining automatic approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The latter fund attracted $12 million in first-day inflows and currently has assets under management of $137 million, indicating considerable early demand for Solana ETFs. The potential for growth in such funds has also been underlined by the recent successes of Ethereum ETFs, which now boast a total AUM of $27.5 billion, according to the latest CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows report. The past month has seen record inflows into ETH ETFs, which grew by $5.24 billion between July 1 and August 1, according to data from Farside. This is roughly comparable to the $5.5 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows over the same period, whereas Solana funds grew by only $137 million, thanks to the aforementioned Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF. In total, Solana-based funds currently boast an AUM of $2.4 billion, which is only 8.7% of the equivalent total for Ethereum funds, whereas Solana’s market cap is approximately 20% of ETH’s. However, while demand for Solana (and altcoin) ETFs is likely to rise in the coming months, some analysts don’t think the inclusion of staking will make a substantial difference. This is the view of Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s Director of ETF & Passive Strategies, who tells Decrypt that he doesn’t expect staking alone to “meaningfully change” institutional demand. “Staking should make ETFs more efficient because they capture yield otherwise missed out on by unstaked spot ETFs, but the main driver of performance will be the underlying cryptocurrency,” he said. “I suspect institutional demand for staked Solana ETFs will come from the desire for diversified crypto exposures, like with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, in case one significantly outperforms or underperforms the others.” However, some industry figures do believe that staking will be an added draw for institutional investors, who previously may have been turned off by the perceived difficulty of staking for themselves. “Institutional demand for staking ETFs is rising fast as investors look for yield without the operational complexity of staking directly,” says James Harris, the Group CEO of DeFi platform Tesseract, speaking to Decrypt. According to Harris, such products will simplify access to protocols such as Ethereum and Solana, the latter of which currently has yields of between 7% and 8%. "It’s a natural evolution: If investors can choose between holding SOL alone or holding SOL while also earning a protocol-native yield, it’s a no-brainer that they’ll prefer the latter,” he added. On the other hand, Harris acknowledges that staking introduces some “execution risk” on top of standard custody and counterparty risk, although in his view the reward generally justifies the added complexity. In particular, the main execution risk involves the aforementioned difficulty of providing redemptions when most of a fund’s SOL is staked, something which Armour recognizes as the primary danger. “Un-staking could take anywhere from hours to several days, with the average time reportedly two to three days,” he explained. “ETF redemptions settle within one day, so the ETF cannot stake the entire portfolio and expect to meet redemptions.” Given this risk, Armour expects that most staking ETFs will ensure that enough of its holdings aren’t staked, although he also accepts that it’s possible that redemptions could exceed the liquid portion of a given fund, creating issues for the ETF and its market makers. He said, “In this scenario, I would expect the price of the ETF to trade at a discount to its net asset value, forcing investors to sell their shares at a discount if they wanted to get out.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Ethereum’s user base and network activity are surging, driven by a rapid spike in daily address creation. Calling out this development, market analyst Peter noted that Ethereum recently registered more than 256,000 new daily addresses, a surge seen only twice before. First, ahead of the 2017 bull run and right before ETH set new all-time highs of $4,878 in 2021. History may not repeat, but it’s echoing loudly. Therefore, Ethereum is experiencing a burst of attention and on-chain engagement, signaling a potentially bullish setup, with momentum building for a possible price breakout. At the time of this writing, Ethereum was up by 5.30% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3,643. Meanwhile, a renowned market analyst recently predicted that Ethereum could soar to $13,000 by Q4 2025, calling the target both bold and achievable. According to market analyst Peter, “ETH ETFs are finally waking up. In July alone, over $4B flowed into ETHA, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF. That’s a newmonthly record.” Therefore, as more capital flowed into BlackRock’s ETHA in a single month than ever before, a strong case is being made for the Ethereum ETF ecosystem because it has crossed the threshold into legitimacy. This explains why ETH is targeting the psychological price of $4,800 as BlackRock advances plans to enable staking in Spot ETH ETF.

Title: State finance officials press US asset managers to denounce ESG, climate

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. A coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to executives at 25 firms, pushing them to denounce climate and net-zero commitments. The push against the use of ESG factors, such as climate considerations in investment decisions and proxy engagement, follows Wall Street’s exodus from climate alliances earlier this year, spurred by mounting pressure from Republican-led state probes and changes in federal leadership. Such departures and climate commitment walkbacks have led to some states dropping previous state-level probes into the banks, including in Texas and Tennessee. The finance officials represent states including Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah. The letter tells asset management firms “seeking to do business” in those states that they should abandon framing climate change as a long-term risk and incorporating net-zero standards. the missive also asks firms to disclose any coalition or collaborative organizations they have memberships in and align proxy voting guidelines “with shareholder value, not environmental or social goals posed by activists.” “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The officials alleged that the “potential risks” of climate change “are framed as certain and catastrophic to justify forcing companies to take immediate actions that may not align with their long-term business interests.” Similarly, the letters frame issues like net-zero and CSRD incorporation and alignment as relying on “predetermined political outcomes, not fiduciary judgment.” The other firms who received the July 29 form letter include Affiliated Managers Group, Alliance Bernstein, BNY Investments and Wealth, Capital Group, Dimensional Fund Advisors, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton, Geode Capital Management, MFS Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, Neuberger Berman, Northern Trust, Nuveen, Prudential, Schwab Asset Management, T. Rowe Price, Wellington Management, and Wells Fargo Wealth and Investments. The state finance officials are seeking a response to their probe by Sept. 1 and have also encouraged targeted investment managers to engage with the offices of the undersigned treasurers, auditors, comptrollers and other state finance officials. According to the July 29 letter, some asset managers have already initiated correspondence with said state officials. Republican finance officials from Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming also signed onto the letter.
