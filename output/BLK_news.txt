Bengaluru: Godrej Properties Ltd will look at profitable growth, expansion through land acquisitions, and build scale through higher market share, said a top company executive. The Mumbai-based developer has achieved 71% of its 2024-25 sales guidance of ₹27,000 crore on the back of strong housing demand and sales. In FY24, the company clocked ₹22,500 crore of sales bookings, making it the highest selling developer. “We will meet the sales guidance in the fourth quarter, which is said to be the strongest quarter in real estate. We have a number of launches coming up in multiple cities including Hyderabad, Noida, Pune, Gurugram. There are also two luxury projects in Mumbai which will be launched,” Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairperson, Godrej Properties, said in an interview. On Tuesday, the company reported a 152.23% rise in net profit to ₹158.20 crore for the October-December quarter, compared to ₹62.72 crore a year earlier. Revenue jumped 193.2% to ₹968.88 crore during the same period. “We are the largest residential developer in the country today, but we have a modest single-digit market share in the property markets we operate in. In FY24, we just about touched 10% market share in NCR, which is possibly our largest market. So, there is huge room for growth for Godrej Properties,” Godrej said. The three-month period through December was the sixth consecutive quarter when Godrej Properties clocked over ₹5,000 crore in sales bookings, the company said, underlying the sectoral tailwinds for India's residential real estate sector. In FY25 so far, the company has added projects of future sales value of over ₹23,000 crore, surprassing its ₹20,000 crore annual guidance. In December, Godrej Properties raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC, Blackrock, and SBI Pension, through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. "This capital allows us to further increase the pace of growth. We need to continue executing well, keep acquiring land and launching projects, and have a stronger presence across the cities we are present in, to gain market share," Godrej said. Around 80-90% of its group housing projects will be focused on the key cities it operates in, which includes Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-National Capital Region, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Godrej Properties will opportunistically look at markets such as Kolkata and Ahmedabad. For plotted development projects, “we are happy to go to the top 20 or more cities”, Godrej said. After clocking around ₹73,000 crore of residential sales bookings in FY24, a milestone for India’s real estate sector, the top four publicly listed developers—Godrej Properties, DLF Ltd, Macrotech Developers Ltd and Prestige Group--are collectively targeting nearly ₹88,000 crore of sales in FY25.

Dunnes Stores boss Margaret Heffernan, has been removed as a defendant and replaced with a company name in High Court proceedings brought by a man who claims building work has interfered with his property in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Derek O’Shaughnessy, with an address at the Morning Star Hotel, Dublin, claims he owns the property at Redgate 1 and 2, Annaville Avenue. He has claimed Ms Heffernan and others interfered with his property rights including by the building of a car park for Dunnes. The alleged interference began, he says, when scaffolding was allegedly unlawfully erected around his Annaville Avenue property from June 25th-July 21st, 2022. [ Dunnes Stores chief executive seeks strike-out of man’s claims of property interferenceOpens in new window ] He also claims a scaffolding firm unlawfully evicted him from his residence with the aid of gardaí and that work on demolishing his former home was carried out without appropriate permission from the council. On Tuesday Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed Ms Heffernan’s name could be removed as a defendant in the case and substituted with Dunnes Stores Better Value Unlimited Company. He also agreed five named gardaí from Blackrock and Dundrum stations could be replaced as defendants by the Garda Commissioner. He claims the gardaí wrongfully assisted in evicting him from what was his home. Last month, Mr O’Shaughnessy was granted interim High Court orders preventing Thomas Corcoran, of scaffolding firm Blackhorse Scaffolding; Frank Curran, chief executive of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council; the five gardaí; and Ms Heffernan from interfering with his property. All defendants deny his claims. He had applied to Mr Justice Brian Cregan for the orders on an ex-parte basis, which meant only he was in court on that day. Mr O’Shaughnessy, who is representing himself before the court, returned before Mr Justice Cregan on Tuesday when he said he was “trying to get at the truth” in bringing proceedings. He said his home had been “bulldozed to a shell” and that Mr Corcoran, who is a scaffolder, was claiming ownership without any proof. Lawyers for Mr Curran, the gardaí and Ms Heffernan said Mr O’Shaughnessy had brought proceedings against the incorrect defendants and they were seeking that they be amended. Ms Heffernan’s counsel, Martin Hayden SC, said his client also wanted the entire case struck out against his client as the pleadings showed no cause of action. He also said his client had “no involvement, good, bad or indifferent with the property”. As well as agreeing to the change of name for Ms Heffernan and the gardaí, Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed that Mr Curran’s name as a defendant could be replaced with Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Co Council. The judge gave directions for exchange of affidavits between the defendants and Mr O’Shaughnessy and said the case could come back in March.

Title: How Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) Drive Up the Cost of Health Care
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/pharmacy-benefit-managers-drive-up-cost-healthcare/5878884
Time Published: 2025-02-04T15:42:01Z
Full Content:
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) evolved from simple claims processors into powerful health care intermediaries that control drug pricing and access through their relationships with insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. PBMs engage in “spread pricing” — charging insurers more than they reimburse pharmacies and pocketing the difference — while also steering patients toward higher-cost medications through “rebate pumping” arrangements with drug manufacturers The current health care system, influenced by PBMs, underemphasizes preventive care while promoting long-term drug dependency, as ongoing prescription management generates more reliable revenue than prevention or cures Independent pharmacies and rural hospitals struggle financially under PBM practices, facing delayed reimbursements, strict audit requirements, and complex negotiation terms that often force them to either close or sell to larger chains Three major investment firms — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (the “Big Three”) — have significant financial stakes across PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance companies, creating a web of interconnected financial interests Solutions include eliminating safe harbor rebate rules, expanding cash-pay health care models, separating PBM services from insurance companies, and implementing stricter regulations to improve pricing transparency * In the featured video, independent journalist Tucker Carlson interviews Brigham Buhler — founder and CEO of Ways2Well, a preventative care and health optimization platform — about how the health insurance industry works to keep us in poor health. Buhler’s career in health care spans over 25 years, during which he gained significant insights into the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The rising cost of health care in the United States has become a heavy burden for many families who struggle to pay for essential services. Patients often end up navigating a maze of insurance requirements, denials, and opaque billing practices without understanding why their treatments cost so much. Pharmaceutical prices add another layer of difficulty, with insurers and other entities setting guidelines that determine access. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, occupy a powerful place in this ecosystem. Initially created to simplify payments and negotiate prices, they have grown into influential brokers controlling which drugs are covered and how they are priced. Critics argue that these corporations operate behind the scenes, orchestrating deals that maximize their profits while pushing more expenses onto patients. In other words, PBMs engage in hidden collaborations and pricing manipulations that fuel a system that is more concerned with corporate gain than with patient well-being. By shedding light on the complex financial incentives at play, Buhler helps us understand why each step of seeking medical care — from preventive screenings to essential prescriptions — feels increasingly draining on both wallets and morale. He reveals an elaborate structure where individuals are funneled into long-term drug usage while basic preventative care is overlooked. Instead of ensuring affordability, PBMs exploit hidden markups and secret rebates to inflate insurance bills and keep people locked in chronic illness. For decades, researchers have warned that chronic disease often begins with lifestyle factors. A diet loaded with chemicals, refined sugars, and addictive formulas paves the way for obesity, metabolic issues, and diabetes. The logical solution would be preventive care, yet the system consistently underfunds or blocks such efforts. Instead, the patient, already in poor health, is nudged into a cycle of drugs. In short, insurance companies profit from setting premiums and reimbursements that don’t address the root causes. PBMs connect drug manufacturers with insurance plans and pharmacies. By deciding which medications get favorable placement on insurance formularies, they have substantial power to shape treatment pathways. They operate as the “middlemen,” determining reimbursement rates and adding costs that might not be obvious to consumers. Critics argue that each link in this chain — from the chemistry of our fast-food culture to the mechanics of corporate insurance contracts — feeds long-term drug dependency. People hope doctors will rescue them with thoughtful interventions, yet many find themselves steered into prescriptions rather than genuine solutions. The net effect is a growing population locked into care that does little to uproot their actual problems. Pharmacy Benefit Managers began as logistical helpers for insurance claims, intended to ease administrative burdens and secure group discounts on medications. In those early days, patients often benefited from lower prices and streamlined services, confident that PBMs were working on their behalf to rein in drug spending. Over time, PBMs took a more pivotal role by merging with major insurers, pharmacies, and even drug companies. This expansion gave them the power to decide which medications appear on covered lists and how high co-pays would be set. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, often called the “Big Three,” poured investments into many PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance firms, linking them financially. Regulatory agencies did little to keep up. Safe harbor laws, originally designed to allow certain discount arrangements, opened a door to hidden deals that few outsiders could track. Even government officials sometimes admit that they lack the tools or data to parse how PBMs arrive at final medication costs or distributions. This vacuum fosters multiple avenues for manipulative pricing. While PBMs publicly champion themselves as experts in cost reduction, many inside observers contend that the real focus is leveraging secret rebates and inflated prices. The result is an enigma for consumers and health providers, who see rising expenses but cannot pinpoint exactly where the money goes. Without greater transparency, the underlying profit mechanisms of PBMs remain locked away behind bureaucratic layers. A key accusation involves “spread” pricing, where PBMs charge insurers a higher rate than they reimburse pharmacies, quietly pocketing the difference. Though advertised as normal operations, this method can inflate costs at every transaction. One high-profile investigation in Ohio’s Medicaid system revealed how drastically these discrepancies boosted PBM revenues, convincing state officials that alternative approaches were more cost-effective. A second alleged tactic is “rebate pumping.” PBMs decide which drugs get priority coverage, sometimes favoring those with generous rebates from manufacturers. While patients believe they are following insurance rules, they might be guided toward medications that offer bigger profits for the PBM, even if more affordable or clinically superior options exist. This hidden arrangement undermines genuine market competition. Formulary manipulation can steer entire populations toward high-cost drugs. When PBMs place lower-cost medications in less accessible tiers or require complicated approvals, patients rarely realize they’ve been nudged into pricier choices. Over time, these directed behaviors funnel billions into the PBM’s revenue stream. Smaller drug makers, unable to provide large rebates, struggle to compete. There is also the “deny, delay, depose” approach: denying coverage, delaying approvals, and deposing providers to wear down patients who challenge any claim refusal. The bureaucracy can be exhausting, compelling many people to simply accept PBM-dictated medications or give up on certain procedures. On top of this, forced mail-order mandates reduce local pharmacy competition. Large PBMs often own chain pharmacies or mail services, ensuring yet another revenue channel. By dictating that some prescriptions must be filled through a mail-order affiliate, they tighten their hold on supply routes. Collectively, all of these maneuvers burden the sick while generating steady corporate windfalls. Small, independent pharmacies are the first to feel the weight of these arrangements. They operate on narrow margins, often waiting extended periods for reimbursement. Regular audits can penalize them if co-pays or deductibles aren’t strictly collected. Many find the financial strain overwhelming and convert to cash-only practices or sell to bigger chains aligned with PBMs. Hospitals, especially those in rural or underserved areas, also struggle. Heavy dependence on insurer contracts means they must accept the terms PBMs set, even if that means late or partial payments. The complexity of negotiations can leave hospitals uncertain of actual reimbursement amounts for surgeries and treatments. Over time, these uncertainties hamper hiring efforts, infrastructure updates, and overall quality of care. Patients shoulder the brunt of it. Co-pays and deductibles, often determined by PBMs in tandem with insurance companies, can skyrocket. A single major procedure might leave someone battling endless paperwork, fighting denials, or searching for a distant “in-network” specialist. Over time, chronic disease management grows more expensive, sometimes to the point where even standard treatments become a risky financial gamble. Though high costs might be justified as byproducts of progress, critics point out that patients who need life-extending therapies can be denied based on invisible profit motivations. These denials or lengthy pre-authorization demands can dangerously delay critical interventions. Overall, the system keeps many people in a perpetual state of fear, worried about the next surprise bill or approval hurdle. The troubling notion is that PBMs profit when people remain in long-term treatment. Managing diabetes, heart disease, or recurring infections, for example, yields continual revenue from drug sales, hospital stays, and follow-up visits. If earlier screenings or lifestyle guidance could prevent these conditions, insurers and PBMs would lose a recurring income stream. Thus, the system subtly discourages prevention. Preventive care often gets labeled as “non-essential.” Insurance companies may only cover minimal checkups or simplified blood panels rather than the deep investigative screenings that might detect cancer cells or metabolic shifts. Doctors who push for thorough evaluations can face audits or claim denials. This approach effectively steers clinicians away from digging into root causes and keeps them dispensing short-term fixes instead. Chemotherapy, obesity medications, and specialized therapies offer further insight. PBMs choose which oncology drugs or weight-loss injections land on the top tier of coverage, frequently guided by favorable rebate structures. For instance, prescribing an expensive cancer drug is more attractive to PBMs than promoting cost-effective solutions or advanced screenings. By focusing on maximum reimbursement rather than clinical optimization, PBMs foster a system that prizes medication adherence over true health. Even potential cures or preventative interventions fade in importance compared to the reliable flow of payments from chronic prescriptions. One of the biggest shields for PBMs lies in corporate media’s dependence on pharmaceutical advertising. Huge budgets flow from big pharma and PBMs into television networks, newspapers, and digital platforms. Investigative reporters who try to expose PBM tactics might find their stories curtailed. Advertisers dislike unfavorable coverage and influence editorial choices that help them maintain their revenue streams. Lobbying piles on another layer of insulation. PBMs, insurers, and drug manufacturers invest massively in shaping legislation. They aim to preserve safe harbor laws and defend the complexity of rebate arrangements. Officials, short on time and expertise, often accept industry talking points that claim PBMs deliver broad discounts. Meanwhile, advanced data remain hidden under confidentiality clauses, preventing thorough oversight. Alternative or cost-effective providers become immediate targets for negative coverage or red tape. Compounding pharmacies, which customize medications more cheaply, face extra scrutiny and high-profile condemnation if any recall occurs. At the same time, preventive clinics that promote advanced blood tests and deeper lifestyle assessments are dismissed as “non-traditional,” leading many patients to doubt their credibility. Without a major shift in how media and lobbying are handled, PBMs will likely continue operating in the shadows, benefiting from the current structure. Even well-intentioned legislators who propose reforms may confront a lobbying wall that distorts or dilutes their efforts. As long as the press echoes PBM-friendly narratives, the public remains unaware of the mechanics that inflate drug costs and stifle real medical innovation. Some argue that the fastest route to PBM accountability is legislative reform. Eliminating safe harbor rebate rules could force full disclosure of every cent collected from manufacturers. If the public saw how big the discrepancy was between list prices and actual reimbursements, the outcry might pressure policymakers to demand fairer pricing structures. Others propose expanding the cash-pay model so that pharmacies and clinics can sidestep PBM-dictated reimbursements. Direct primary care clinics, which ask for a monthly membership rather than rely on insurance, show promise. Patients pay transparent fees, sidestepping the labyrinth of co-pays, claim denials, and lengthy authorization steps. Critics say it may limit coverage for catastrophic events, but supporters argue it fosters clearer, more compassionate medical relationships. Another idea is to separate PBM services from insurance altogether. Insurers could be barred from owning or partnering with PBMs, avoiding the vertical integration that squeezes out independent competitors. If drug costs were set in an open marketplace, free from hidden rebates, local pharmacies might compete on actual prices, improving affordability for the average consumer. Finally, bold political will is essential. Some leaders talk about dismantling PBMs, a move that could reorder the entire pharmaceutical ecosystem. Opponents decry it as radical, but the current system is unsustainable. If enough people demand an end to covert backroom deals, PBMs could be dethroned from their gatekeeping position, placing health care decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients. The PBM conversation intersects with a larger reality: a culture of processed foods and tobacco-inspired marketing that has ravaged public health. By engineering addictive flavors and packaging, corporations profit from driving individuals toward chronic ailments like diabetes. PBMs then profit further from long-term prescription management. This chain of enticements traps many in endless cycles of medication. Preventive medicine would disrupt this pattern, but PBMs have little reason to champion comprehensive screenings. If fewer people develop metabolic disease, the volume of prescription-based revenue drops, undermining the financial base of PBM operations. In short, more robust screenings, especially for heart disease and early-stage cancer, would save lives but erode corporate balance sheets. The good news is that many patients are now starting to rebel and opt for things like direct-pay blood tests, customized diets, and health care providers who embrace functional principles — all of which weaken the PBM chokehold. By proactively caring for your body, you reduce the likelihood of becoming a chronic customer for expensive prescriptions. The goal, in essence, is to break the cycle that pairs hidden market incentives with manufactured disease. PBMs exert a profound influence on who gets what medication and at what cost, yet much of their work is veiled from public view. As explained by Buhler, this system, anchored in concealed rebates, inflated average wholesale prices, and manipulative formulary structures, is responsible for skyrocketing health care costs. Patients feel the sting through insurance premiums, high deductibles, and arbitrary claim denials. By peeling back the layers, we see a troubling alliance between PBMs, major insurers, and media outlets — a web that thrives on keeping Americans in long-term prescription cycles. Though reforms have been proposed, progress is stalled by extensive lobbying and carefully crafted narratives that depict PBMs as cost-saving heroes. Still, a rising movement demands real transparency and policy changes that might reset the playing field. Shifting the balance of power involves both political and individual actions. For example, we need to urge lawmakers to abolish secret rebate loopholes and consider stricter regulation of PBMs. On a personal level, you can also explore direct-pay health care models, improve your knowledge about preventive medicine, and support local pharmacies that sidestep the PBM structure. As noted in the featured interview, a failure to confront these issues leaves us with ever-increasing premiums, minimal improvements in chronic disease outcomes — and minimal trust in the institutions supposed to protect public health. But if genuine policy efforts and grassroots initiatives merge, we can begin to reclaim control. The prospects for cheaper drugs, renewed primary care, and a greater focus on prevention could then become more than just a distant hope. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin Price On The Brink: Failure To Hold This Level May Trigger Crash To $74,000

Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing renewed selling pressure as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China lead to fresh tariffs on both sides. The largest cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $91,000 on Monday, while major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also faced losses. The most recent installment of tariffs comes after the US enacted a 10% tax on all items from China, leading China to respond with its own tariffs on certain US imports, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, starting February 10. In another development, China has launched an inquiry into Google LLC over supposed antitrust infringements, intensifying the tension between the two economic giants. This market turbulence has wiped out the benefits from a short relief rally on Monday, which occurred after the Trump administration decided to postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month. The weekend’s initial declaration of US tariffs had already triggered a steep drop in cryptocurrency prices. Investor trust in riskier assets has been notably affected, as US investors pulled a net $235 million from a set of 12 Bitcoin-centric exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday. Moreover, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Inc.’s derivatives market decreased by 4%, reflecting a more cautious attitude among institutional investors. President Donald Trump, recognized for his pro-crypto position, has unintentionally brought more uncertainty to digital asset markets. Although cryptocurrencies experienced a rise following Trump’s election, the market now faces a difficult landscape marked by geopolitical strife and regulatory obstacles. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,970, about 13% shy of its all-time high. Meanwhile, US ETFs investing in Ethereum witnessed record trading volumes on Monday, with significant liquidation of leveraged positions rattled by ongoing trade uncertainties. The iShares Ethereum Trust, led by BlackRock, accounted for nearly half of the $1.5 billion in trading volume among a group of nine ETFs. ETH plummeted by as much as 27% on Monday, leading to over $600 million in liquidations within perpetual futures markets, according to Bloomberg data. Analyzing current price trends, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,180 as a critical support level for Bitcoin, based on MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) pricing bands. If this support level fails, the next target could be $74,400. Despite the recent price correction, Bitcoin traders are still enjoying a profit margin of 3.36%. Historically, local bottoms have formed when profit margins drop below -12%, suggesting that Bitcoin could have further downside potential before reaching a true bottom. Additionally, the MVRV Momentum indicator has remained in negative territory since the beginning of the year, signaling ongoing market weakness.

(I wrote a bit about this in last Thursday’s article. Since the market has rebounded a bit since, we’re going to talk about it more today. A preview? It’s not too late to buy the dip.) Why do income investors hold an edge here? Because they have a chance to buy Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI stocks, including some private-equity firms few people have access to, through closed-end funds. Tapping the selloff this way gives us two key benefits: The two funds in question—the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ) are the two funds we’re focusing on here. They work well when bought as a pair because they have different mandates: BST focuses more on the big caps of the tech world, holding stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. BSTZ holds some of those, as well, but also has smaller companies and private-equity firms focused on growth. That lends itself to more upside, but also more volatility—something BST, with its larger cap focus, helps us address. To really get at the opportunity we’re looking to tap into here, let’s talk a bit more about DeepSeek and what it means for AI and the tech sector more generally. Essentially, DeepSeek, which originated in China, was allegedly developed and trained for only $6 million. It’s now being offered as an open-source model essentially for free. With a cost of $0 for this AI tech, the reasoning goes, there’s no reason to spend billions on AI from companies like OpenAI or others whose stocks soared on the tech last year. Those include Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, all of which tanked on Monday, with NVIDIA, maker of the chips that underpin AI, falling 17%. Then, on Tuesday, the market erased much of its losses. Nvidia has more room to recover, though there could be short-term choppiness as investors debate what all this means. So, what should we make of this whole situation? Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that AI is critical to the stock market, and even a whiff of things going amiss could cause a reflexive selloff. The word “reflexive” here is key, because the selloff really didn’t make much sense. Free AI tools lower capital expenditure from businesses paying AI providers like OpenAI. That’s obviously bad for OpenAI and possibly Microsoft, which has invested almost $14 billion into OpenAI. Of course, that $14 billion is less than one-half of one percent of Microsoft’s market cap, so it’s really not that big of a blow. Maybe it’s bad for Alphabet? That doesn’t make much sense, either, as Alphabet has been giving away many of its AI tools to ensure people keep using Google services, like search. So it isn’t really a direct competitor to DeepSeek. And Nvidia? That stock’s selloff was the most egregious, and not because it was the biggest. Thing is, free AI tools mean people will use more AI. And since lower prices increase demand for a product, the more AI demand there is, the more demand there will be for Nvidia chips in the long run. DeepSeek’s new chatbot should’ve caused Nvidia shares to rise, not fall. Still, these stocks fell because this was a new story, and new stories create fear, which causes panic selling. Which is why we saw investors buy Nvidia shortly after. It’s not too late to join them—and as mentioned, BST and BSTZ are great avenues to take here. Especially when, in the case of Nvidia, we were in this same situation just six months ago. Back in July 2024, fears that both then-President Joe Biden and Donald Trump would impose controls on Nvidia selling chips to China caused the stock to fall 12% that month, with almost all of the drop coming in a little more than a week (shown below). July Tech Dip Other big tech names—like Alphabet (in orange) and Microsoft (in blue), as well as the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF (VGT), a reasonable proxy (in purple)—were dragged down alongside NVIDIA. Anyone who bought that dip did well, as all of these stocks have recovered since, and helped drive tech (again measured by VGT, in purple) to outperform the S&P 500, even after last week’s selloff. Tech Rallies That’s likely why some investors pounced on the DeepSeek–driven selloff. Which brings us back to BST and BSTZ, and the opportunity they give us to “lock in” a selloff that hasn’t yet fully recovered. Post-selloff, both BST and BSTZ now trade at unusually large discounts to net asset value (5.4% for BST and 10.2% for BSTZ). And those discounts are near their widest since the last tech selloff six months ago. So not only are we getting NVIDIA (the largest holding in both of these funds) at a discount thanks to the selloff, but we’re buying these funds when their own discounts are particularly wide. We can see by comparing the tech sector’s performance to BSTZ’s since its discount widened to 12% in August 2024 to now, even after the recent selloff. BSTZ Outperforms BST? Similarly, buying BST when its discount widened to its largest point in mid-August last year and holding to the time I’m writing this also resulted in outperformance, although a tad less than BSTZ’s, since BST focuses more on large caps. And the kicker: Buying these funds and holding while waiting for similar outperformance gets us an 8% yield with BST and 12.7% from BSTZ, for that 10.4% average payout. It goes to show that buying oversold CEFs, collecting their dividends as they recover, then selling when the market fully rebounds is a proven way to build your net worth while maximizing your income and diversifying, too.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin Reserve May Be Coming, But States Are Winning the Race

Almost half of the state governments in the U.S. are either on a path toward putting some of their money into crypto or already have, and much of a suddenly booming interest in tying their financial futures to the digital-assets markets has come after U.S. President Donald Trump showed support for a national stockpile of digit assets. In the surge of crypto legislative or financial efforts at the state level, 21 states are investing or looking into investing — generally in the industry's leading token, bitcoin (BTC), and sometimes also in less volatile stablecoins that are designed to match the value of the U.S. dollar, according to a CoinDesk analysis. With states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania, Utah and Texas already digging into legislation to open public funds to buy cryptocurrencies, such initiatives may outpace the effort in Congress targeting a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Sixteen state legislatures are looking at bills to either establish digital assets stockpiles or to allow their state retirement funds to be partially invested in crypto, most of them introduced in recent weeks. Officials in another three states are engaged in serious discussions about joining in, and the money managers for two states — Michigan and Wisconsin — have already dipped parts of their public employees' retirement portfolios into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If the states begin pouring portions of their public funds into bitcoin and other digital assets, it would potentially lock down billions of dollars of the tokens for extended periods, boosting the value of the assets still openly circulating. Another effect: The states are potentially setting up millions of people to have personal stakes in the health of the crypto sector — whether they want to or not. In several of the proposals, governments are looking to follow in the footsteps of Michigan and Wisconsin in pushing parts of their retirement funds and state pension investments into digital assets. Retired school teachers, law enforcement officers and other public employees will watch some of their financial security become dependent on the fluctuations of the crypto markets. Other pieces of legislation would instruct state treasurers to spend as much as 10% of their public funds on a strategic reserve, with some specifying that qualifying digital assets must have at least a $500 billion market cap, leaving only bitcoin currently meeting the mark. Arizona and Utah are building a lead after getting their efforts passed by legislative committees, but other states weighing some version of a crypto bill also include Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. Others, such as Alabama, Florida and Kentucky are considering proposals from state officials or on the verge of pursuing legislation. The states interested in digital assets reserves are predominantly Republican-majority in their politics, and the reasons the lawmakers say they're backing the bills include investment diversity and embracing technological innovation. The amount put away by the states could eventually be overshadowed by the U.S. government's own reserve, if that effort comes to pass. President Trump, in his wider executive order on U.S. crypto policy, called for his administration to "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile." The order suggested it may be built from government seizures of crypto in criminal cases. The idea had initially been pitched by Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Republican who devotes much of her political bandwidth to supporting crypto and was named as the first chair of the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee. Her bill to set up a U.S. reserve calls for the country to obtain about $20 billion worth of the tokens in the first year and to get another 200,000 in each of the next four years, until the U.S. is eventually holding a million bitcoin. While Lummis' pitch has called it a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve," it's not — like the petroleum reserve — designed for deployment when economic conditions warrant it. It's structured more as a long-term investment, requiring the U.S. to hold the assets for at least 20 years. That would be almost 5% of the eventual, finite supply of global bitcoin going untouched for at least two decades. Combined with whatever the states seek to stockpile, U.S. governments would secure a significant percentage of the asset, in addition to the towering reserves held by the U.S. ETF issuers such as BlackRock and Grayscale and corporate investors led by MicroStrategy. The states' interest in bitcoin potentially lands Satoshi Nakamoto's ultimate exercise of financial outsiders firmly in the realm of the insiders, adding the asset to the core functions of government. The Bitcoin white paper meant to establish a system of transactions outside of the need of financial-firm intermediaries or government oversight. States setting up bitcoin funds managed in part by new laws could become some of the most stable of the industry's institutional investors. And naming bitcoin as a "strategic reserve" puts the digital tokens on par with gold and oil as economic mainstays, despite the very different nature of cryptocurrencies and their practical weaknesses as an inflation hedge. From the perspective of their citizens or public employees, states that grab crypto stakes will come away with two potential outcomes: Millions of people will enjoy more comfortable and well-funded retirements or public services; or millions of people will watch a crypto crash eat into the safety net they're counting on. It could be "disastrous for tens of millions of retirees if government officials gambled with state pension funds to buy bitcoin or crypto," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group that's critical of the dangers of digital assets. He called the idea of a government bitcoin stockpile "a brazen attempt by a handful of crypto billionaires and their political allies to take money out of Main Street taxpayers’ pockets to create artificial demand for a highly volatile product that suffers from boom-bust cycles, is full of fraudulent trading and pricing in unregulated markets, and has no socially legitimate use, but is loved by criminals." Wagers on the prediction site Polymarket have put the odds of one of the states beginning to set aside bitcoin reserves before the end of this month at 11%, and the chances of the U.S. setting up such a reserve this year at the national level are at 45%. It may already be a trend that governments around the world can't ignore. "We anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin," Fidelity Digital Assets researchers predicted in a look-ahead report for 2025. "Facing challenges such as debilitating inflation, currency debasement, and increasingly crushing fiscal deficits, not making any bitcoin allocation could become more of a risk to nations than making one."

Title: Trump signs order creating first-ever US sovereign wealth fund —and TikTok could be its first purchase

Posted on 02/04/2025 5:07:08 AM PST by V_TWIN WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Monday to create a sovereign US wealth fund — saying that TikTok may become one of its first acquisitions. A sovereign wealth fund is an investment fund owned and operated by a government. The world’s largest and wealthiest such funds are owned by China and resource-rich countries like Norway and Middle Eastern emirates. It was not immediately specified how the US endowment — the creation of which was first reported last month by The Post’s Charles Gasparino — would be capitalized, but Trump previously floated using tariff proceeds. It’s unclear if adding a stake in TikTok would require up-front investment, or if Beijing would offload it without charge to avoid a looming 10% levy that Trump announced Friday. “It’s a very exciting event. We’re going to have a sovereign wealth fund, which we’ve never had,” Trump said in the Oval Office — as News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison sat nearby.

Title: Six entities to make foray into soaring MF biz

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Six new asset management companies (AMCs) are set to enter the fast-growing mutual fund (MF) industry this year and the asset under management (AUM) of MFs growing 32 per cent to ₹66.93 lakh crore in December 2024 against ₹52.74 lakh crore in December 2023. The market regulator has already given ‘in-principle’ approval to Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings, and final approval to Angel One and Unifi Capital. The market regulator initially grants in-principal approval after reviewing the application and assessing the applicants’ basic eligibility. After this, the applicant is allowed to start MF business by setting up the infrastructure and hire the core team. The regulator inspects the progress of the companies after six months and issues the final licence if the applicant meets all the criteria. Unifi, in fact, has filed a draft paper with SEBI for its maiden fund - Unifi Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund . In the past few months, SEBI has issued several partial and final approvals for the new MF players (applicants) to widen the MF reach and attract investors from smaller towns.AlphaGrep Securities, Ask Investment Managers and Monarch Networth Capital have also filed applications that are under consideration with SEBI. In 2023, five new AMCs entered the MF industry, but three of them entered through acquisitions. Vivek Sharma, Head of Investment, Estee Advisors, said while the MF industry has seen a tremendous growth, much of it was from equity schemes. The number of debt schemes has grown to 317 last year from 314 at the end of 2023. In contrast, equity schemes saw a significant net addition of 70 new funds. AMFI had proposed a Debt-Linked Savings Schemes to the Finance Ministry, but there was no mention of it in the Finance Minister’s speech, he said. Currently, the total expense ratio (TER) for debt funds ranges from 0.8 per cent for AUM above ₹50,000 crore and a maximum of 2 per cent for the first ₹500 crore. Providing incentives will definitely improve adoption of debt products, but higher TER means a lower return for investors, he added. Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager, Whitespace Alpha, said while more fund houses create an illusion of expanded choices, most of them will be equity-focused, particularly targeting small-cap, mid-cap and thematic segments. With too many equity funds chasing a limited set of investment opportunities, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks, liquidity constraints and valuation risks will increase, he added.

February 4, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Apollo’s Torsten Slok on the US Economy & Trump 2.0, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, our returning champion, Torsten Slack, chief economist at Apollo. You know, most of the economists that you’re probably familiar with haven’t really had a good handle on the state of the economy over the past couple of years. They have been expecting recessions, they’ve expected contractions. They kind of missed the surge in inflation, they missed the collapse in inflation. There aren’t a lot of economists who got it more right than Torsten Slack. Not only has he been appropriately bullish about what’s going on in the economy, why we weren’t really in danger of a recession anytime over the past couple of years. I, I disagree with his forecast for this year, which is 0% chance of recession. Hey, I never put a 0% chance on anything. But still he’s communicating how wrong everybody else is and how right he’s been and why you should be pretty constructive about the state of both employment and credit and the stock market he has. He has absolutely been dead on. And I have to point out what a force of nature he is. He, he’s got a really fascinating background, IMF, OECD, Deutsche Bank, and now on the private buy side with a big emphasis on private sector companies. I don’t know what else to say. I thought this conversation was absolutely fascinating. He was just on such a roll. All I had to do is just kind of give him a little nudge and get outta the way. Really an absolutely tour to force explanation as to why the US and global economy is where it is, where it’s like to continue going and why there are such tailwinds for growth in the US and to a lesser degree Japan. But why the US is so much better situated than Europe or China and most of Asia. I found this to be absolutely fascinating and I think you also, with no further ado, my discussion with Apollo Global managements to in Slack. Torsten Slok: Thanks so much, Barry, and it’s great to be here instead of sitting in a boat fishing in Maine as you and I have done together before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. That’s a mouthful of places where you’ve worked. Before we get into your career, I wanna start with University of Copenhagen and Princeton University. WA was the career plan, always economics and finance. Torsten Slok: Well, I grew up in a small town called Rush Kilder, which is 30 kilometers to the west of Copenhagen. You could see I’m so European still that I speak in kilometers rather than miles. Right. And I studied economics in university. And then when I started doing my PhD, you have to go a year abroad. And I spent a year in Princeton in the economics department in 95, 96 when Ben Panke was the chairman of the economics department. And then when I finished my degree, I applied for a job at the IMF in Washington dc And economics has basically been the bread and butter of my life, at least my adult life for the last 25, 30 years. Barry Ritholtz: I’ve been to Denmark, beautiful country. Beautiful. Copenhagen is absolutely beautiful. I’m curious how different studying economics is in Denmark versus United States. Torsten Slok: Well, obviously all the super universities are here. So from a publishing an academic perspective, it’s really good, but it’s just a, a little bit different in the sense that it is not, of course having the same environment, the same seminars and for that matter, the same people of course that are in the us. But that being said, Europe still has some really incredible universities, including University of Copenhagen. You learn a lot. And as you know, European style, your degree is not an undergraduate degree in four years, it’s a master’s degree where you start out on day one studying economics, theology, humanities. And you do that for five years in a row. So you end up doing five years relatively specialized in this case, in economics for me. And I found it just that the environment, everything that I experienced that went through there and still have many good friends at the university and of course in Copenhagen that I still talk to, to this day about economics and what’s going on in financial markets Barry Ritholtz: And make me a little jealous. Do you pay for college and graduate school or does the state cover that? Torsten Slok: So it happens to be the case in Denmark that tuition is completely free. In fact, you get a stipend, which is three, $4,000 a month. Wow. On top of that, you also get, so this is as a PhD student, you also get, of course I need to say this, free healthcare. And of course all this is subsidized and ultimately paid for by the Danish taxpayers. Right? That’s why marginal tax rates in Denmark are 55%. Right. And not 37% as it is in the us right? Barry Ritholtz: It is better to be middle class or lower class in Denmark. It’s better to be wealthy in the United States. Everyone, at least in terms of net dollars in your pocket, Torsten Slok: Everyone has access to healthcare, everyone has access to free education, and then you just have to do your homework, which is the hard part, and then of course complete your education. But it is absolutely a major difference, of course, to what we had to do. Barry Ritholtz: But you left before you had to pay those 55% tax rates. Well, Torsten Slok: So I just got my free education and then left. So, but I am still both a Danish citizen. I’m also a US citizen, so I’m trying to get the best and make the most of both Worlds. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about your career. You start out as an economist at the IMF, right? OUTTA school. I, I know at a certain point at the IMF, you were the guy writing the world’s economic outlook and you were covering China and Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. Do you start out right outta school doing the global outlook for the IMF or you have to work your way up to that? No, Torsten Slok: You absolutely have to work your way up. But the IMF has this great philosophy that the young people who start in the organization throw them on deep water. And in this case, that means in IMF language that you need to go on a program country. And a program country is a country that normally has some IMF loan or is drawing on some IMF facility. And in my case, I was pulled into working on Mongolia. Wow. So I went to Ulan Baton in January where it was about as cold as it is here in New York City today. Right. And it is quite an experience to come to an emerging market when you are just around 30 years old and you certainly sit there with the Central Bank governor, you sit down with the Minister of Finance and of course there’s a whole team. I was the most junior person. And you try to think about what are the macroeconomic problems for this country? How can we get this country back on track? Under what conditions should they borrow? All those things are a very critical part of the education you get at the IMF. Namely, learning to analyze and understand an economy from a macroeconomic perspective, Barry Ritholtz: That that sounds like it was an amazing experience. Torsten Slok: It was incredible. I had never obviously looked at a thought about Mongolia too much before. So the fact that you suddenly I involved and also the whole process at the IMF, which is very important, you basically have a country that have some macroeconomic problems. Then there is a process of them going to the board of the IMF and the executive board of the IMF then has to discuss under what conditions do we want to give a loan to this country? And that process of giving a loan, in some cases the IMF says, yes, you can have a loan. In other cases the IMF says, no, you cannot have a loan because you’re not willing or able to meet the conditionality that comes with borrowing money from the IMF. And often countries come to the IMF when they’re not able to not able to borrow in public markets. And that’s why the IMF plays this special role of having conditionality having conditions associated with borrowing. That means that you can borrow, but only if you do these things that the global community thinks is a good idea. And in some cases might be politically challenging, but we do this. So try to get you out of this problem that you’re in at the moment. So, Barry Ritholtz: So now let’s compare and contrast. You go from there, the OECD in Paris. What’s it like being an economist in Paris? Yeah, Torsten Slok: So the IMF has money and gives a loan to countries, whereas the OECD is really just a think tank. It used to be really mainly more wealthy countries, meaning developed markets meaning the G seven plus a few others. But now it has broadened out a bit more to also have Brazil, Chile, other countries that you would normally categorize as emerging markets. But the OECD basically is an organization in Paris that lays out best practice across countries. So as a government, you think constantly about what is best practice for healthcare policies, for pension policies, for all kinds of other policies when it comes to climate change, when it comes to really all areas of policy making. And the idea is to get together in Paris for the OECD countries to come and say, what experiences have you made when you put together a pension system? What experiences have we made? And the IMF then writes a report and says, these are the ways that people have done it, that work. And other, sometimes they say, other examples are, this is where it has not worked very well to try for you and me and the US and Denmark and all other countries in the world to have an example of how should we design our pension system? How do we make sure that there are enough retirement savings for our population? How has it been done in other countries? So it’s really an organization that really is a think tank, but it really is a best practice think tank where you get experiences and you get practices from other countries that then can be used again in in the countries that are participating. Huh, Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. So the biggest chunk of your career was at Deutsche Bank. Did you start in in Germany or did you start here in New York? So Torsten Slok: I started here in New York because some of my former colleagues from the IMF had moved to Deutsche Bank, David before Golan and Pinky Charter. And they called and asked if I wanted to come to the US and work here with them. And this was in 2005. It was not our plan. My wonderful wife Julie and I had our first son and his name is Fleming. And it was a 2003 and we lived in Paris. We all enjoyed it. We were actually trying to get a bit closer to Copenhagen, but then out of the blue pinky called and said, Hey, would you like to come to New York and work with us? And my experience from the IMF and the OECD and then this opportunity to be in Deutsche Bank with some friends and colleagues that I had known for many years and who are still my really good friends today, of course meant that I said, well, why don’t we try this? And Julie was up for it. So we moved our family over here from Paris in 2005. Barry Ritholtz: So brief digression, I don’t know who Binky is personally, I’ve never met him. I cannot begin to tell you how many people have referenced him as a mentor, as an influence as this is a person who just had such a big impact in the world of finance. We’ll get to the mentor questions later. I’m just curious how outsized a personality is is binky. Yeah. Torsten Slok: So a very important part of your question also here is that it is absolutely critical to remember that inside organizations such as the IMF and the OECD, you establish long-term relationships with people that really almost in, in a lot of cases, basically last for almost your whole career or your whole life. So that means you built strong connections with people, you work with them in stress situations, in less stress situations, in good and bad times. And I had worked with Binky, not directly under him and also David Lan, but they were both of course, very important employees at the IMF. And when they decided to move to Deutche Bank, I decided to say, well, I know these people really well. And binky indeed, even today, as you know, he’s still the chief equity strategist at the Deutsche Bank. He has some incredible frameworks and I have learned a lot from him. We’ll talk more about this later in terms of you need to have a framework when you talk about things. And he was the first one and still is to this day is telling me you need to have a framework. What is the framework why you are thinking the stock market will go up or the dollar will go down or the fed will high rates. All these things came from a discussion from Pinky and David and several others. And who by the way, also have a PhD in economics because they were the ones who got me into de bank starting in 2005. Barry Ritholtz: So you spent 15 years at Deutsche Bank. That’s the biggest part of your career on the sell side. I’m curious, how do you curate a firm view? How do you develop, Hey, this is the perspective of Deutsche Bank, you, US which is a giant entity? Well, Torsten Slok: As you and I have been talking about for many years, different banks have different strategies. So some banks have a house view, other banks have a house of views. So that means that in this case, Deutsche Bank was run in a way. And I think that does make sense where there was no strong house view every day on everything because we have to let individuals free in the sense that the different people have different types of expertise in different areas. So at DB we would sit down around the table, think about the Federal Reserve or the ECP or the Bank of Japan, and we would then say, okay, whoever was the main person responsible for that central bank, what is your view? Let’s discuss, do we all agree with this? What are the arguments why this is right? What are the arguments why this is wrong? This gives a healthy debate, this gives a healthy way of saying, we have now turned every stone and we end up where we publish the view that, let’s say that the Fed, for example, today, we’ll talk about this later, will be keeping interest rates on hold. But that discussion, of course, is a very important part of the debate. Instead of just having, well, I am having someone in the organization who says, oh, the Fed will not do anything, but everyone else can then sit around and say, oh, I disagree with that view. I think the view should be different. So there is no easy solution to this problem, but it is the case that at Deutsche, it used to be the situation where we would sit around the table and fight it out and end up with a view on what do we think is the outlook for, in this case, the Fed DCB or the Bank of Japan or any other central bank or any other market we were looking at. Huh, Barry Ritholtz: Really, really interesting. So you’re at a government entity, then you’re at a think tank, then you’re at a sell side brokerage firm, then you end up at Apollo, which not only is buy side, but it’s more focused on the private markets than the public markets. I’m curious, what led you to Apollo and what was that transition like? Yeah, Torsten Slok: So at Deutsche Bank I spent essentially all my time on going to clients with sales. So we would go to pimco, BlackRock, Brevin, Howard, all the hedge funds, all the real money managers. And we would sit down and talk about what is the outlook for rates, equities, commodities, everything in the macro world that they wanted to discuss. At Apollo, my job is quite different and it has some different elements that I didn’t have in my job with Deutsche Bank. So what was the attraction was that after 15 years of traveling around the world and talking about the macro in client meetings, really anywhere you could go where anyone was interested in the US economic outlook at Apollo, I spent roughly half of my time still doing that on the fundraising side. But the other half of my time I spend internally talking to deal teams. A deal team is looking at buying a company, a deal team is looking at giving a loan to a company. This could be in the us, it could be in Europe, it could be in anywhere in the world, Brazil. It could be really any type of financing that we would be studying carefully. And in some of these cases, macroeconomics is less important. In other cases, macroeconomics is really important. Meaning we begin to discuss what is the outlook for rates? Meaning what are the financing costs, what’s the outlook for spreads, what’s the outlook for even wages, what’s the outlook for low income wages, middle income wages, high income wages, what is the outlook for the dollar? And we also have discussions of what is the outlook for politics. So those things are not things that we can control, but they nevertheless turn out to be really important if you want to understand the risks associated with the investment that you’re doing. What attracted me to come to Apollo was I still am doing to a last degree. Many of the things, again, half of my job is traveling around the world talking to people about the macroeconomic outlook. But the internal part of talking to deal teams and for that matter also talking to management about what’s going on, what are we seeing, what are we hearing? And we have 50, a little less than 50 portfolio companies talking to the CEOs of these portfolio companies. It all gives a very corporate finance addition to my macroeconomic thinking. And that was and continues to be the main significant attraction that I find so exciting about my job naming that is combining the macro world with the corporate finance and the deal team world in private credit and private equity. And then trying to come up with a view, what do we think will happen going forward. Barry Ritholtz: Now at Deutsche Bank, you were a fairly traditional economic publisher. When you moved to Apollo, you developed several new platforms, new content platforms. I think everybody who’s listening is probably familiar with the Daily Spark, which is sort of your chart of the day, which is always fascinating and niche and chockfull of information. But you also put out full research decks and full the traditional economic data series. But then on top of that is the Apollo Academy. Tell us a little bit about that. Torsten Slok: Yeah, so the idea with the Apollo Academy is there are really several different purposes. So first of all, Apollo Academy is really the prime place to go if you want to understand alternatives because it is often of course the case that people in financial markets, everyone spends so much time on s and p 500, right? Because s and p 500 is what we all discuss all day long. But if you look at businesses with employment in the US, there are 6 million firms in the US that have employment. So the fact that we spend time on 500 companies out of 6 million businesses, it just doesn’t make too much sense. So that’s why private markets and what’s going on in private markets, both in private equity and also in of course in private credit is a very important part of the US and the global economy. So that’s what we try to do in Apollo Academy, namely have various educational materials. White paper was about private credit, white paper was about private equity. White paper was about asset backed finance. White paper was about all kinds of aspects of what our private markets today. And what we also do on the apollo academy.com homepage is of course that we also produce, as you just mentioned, a daily spark email, which is a chart that we produce every day, which is some interesting topic that we are thinking about. And we also try to have, by the way, we also have podcast and we also have videos, but we try to generally have material so that people and the public out there can be informed about what’s going on in alternatives and in private markets at the moment. Barry Ritholtz: I just want to talk briefly about the daily spark, ’cause I’m fascinated both on the subjects that you focus on and the process you use in creating it. Something recently that showed up New York Hotel costs, now that seems so specific. What do New York Hotel costs tell us about the broader economy? Torsten Slok: We, this is a really good question and you’re not the only one to probably think about that. Among the listeners. Many for those who do subscribe to the Daily Spark are probably scratching their heads sometimes and saying, why are we even talking about this? We also have data sometimes that will look at for how many people are visiting the Statue of Liberty, right? We also look at how many people go to Broadway shows. Barry Ritholtz: I remember seeing that… Torsten Slok: You and I laugh at it sometimes and you should also laugh at it sometimes and say, why? Why are we looking at this? But in fact, it is still the case that if you think about it, well hotel costs are important for a number of different reasons. Not only from a commercial estate investing perspective, but it’s also important to get some understanding of how expensive is it. Now, the average price for staying at a hotel at the moment in New York City is more than $400. That is really expensive. Think about also how much that has gone up, how much of that has gone up after Covid. That has implications for how you think about what is occupancy rates for hotels, not only in New York, but nationwide. That has implications for how well is the consumer doing that has implications for tourism. It has just so many ramifications. A lot of these things, even how many people go to Broadway shows also tells you something about is there a willingness among consumers to spend on discretionary spending something that’s a little bit expensive. The average Broadway show ticket cost around around $150. And Barry Ritholtz: That’s a bargain right there at Buck 50. Torsten Slok: It could be a lot more expensive than that, right? And all that to your question is you say, well, why are we looking at this? So without writing a long, long, 30 page paper with 30 footnotes, just a simple chart saying, Hey, check this out. This is something we are thinking about. You can say, oh, I don’t really care about this. Why should I worry about how many people, again, go to Broadway shows or how many people go to the Statue of Liberty? Or what is the cost of staying overnight at a hotel? But it still is something that at least is one dimension to thinking about a lot of the different things that are going on. And that is the benefit. And that’s what I’m enjoying so much of producing one every day because then I, I write about something today and tomorrow I can write about something else. And, Barry Ritholtz: The fact that you do something completely different every day, someone may say, who cares how many people go to the Statue of Liberty? But when you see 90 different charts over the course of three or four months, it starts to paint a broader picture as to what’s going on. All these little niche data points they add up. And it gives you a perspective on the economy that you may not get looking at GDP or unemployment Torsten Slok: As as when you and I always talk about what is the economic outlook, and then you can start in some corner, but I still need to paint you a picture, a mosaic that ultimately has some different pieces. And these charts are exactly meant to be different pieces in what is going on in the economy and more broadly, what is it in financial markets that we should be talking about And that’s relevant. And sometimes some of these pieces in the mosaic may look insignificant and not very critical. But in other times, a chart could simply also be, what’s the trend in inflation? Should we expect inflation to go up now that Trump has been talking about tariffs, now that we may have restrictions on immigration now that we may lower corporate tax rates on domestic manufacturers to 15%, could that be a reason why there might be some lift in some of the more important indicators other than of course some of the more funny indicators that we’ve been talking about up to this point we Barry Ritholtz: Were talking earlier at, at the mosaic of different data points that create an economic outlook. Let’s talk first about the US and then the rest of the world. You’ve described the US economy as quote firing on all cylinders discuss. Torsten Slok: So the backdrop for where we sit today is of course that GDP growth for the last two and a half years since the Fed began to raise interest rates has been remarkably strong. And this has raised a number of important questions in financial markets. Namely when the Fed raised interest rates, I would have expected and the textbook would have expected that home prices should have been going down. That’s not what has happened. You would’ve expected that when interest rates go up, car sales should go down. That is not what has happened. And you would also have expected that when interest rates go up, that CapEx spending and business spending by businesses should also be slowing down. And that is not what has happened. And why is it that the economy has continued to be so strong? In other words, what happened to long and variable lags that the Federal Reserve FOMC members have talked about for so long? Why didn’t the economy slow down when interest rates went up? And there are three very important reasons why that didn’t happen. First of all, we have had a much less interest rate sensitive economy this time around than we’ve had before. Most importantly, 95% of mortgages outstanding in the US are 30 year fixed rate. And that means that when interest rates started going up, that meant that mortgage payments did not go up for consumers because consumers had locked in low interest rates during the pandemic. And this was also the case for corporate debt. Net interest payments as a share of operating surplus in the US has been going down despite that the Fed has been raising interest rates. So there was also less interest rates sensitivity for corporates. So taken together the first argument, why is the economy still so strong? Because Fed hikes simply did not have a particularly negative impact on consumers and on firms as the textbook would have predicted. Secondly, in the US we also have a data center. Boom, we have an AI and data center boom. Unlike what we see in any other countries, there’s 6,000 data centers in the US more than all other country countries combined in the world. So data center boom has probably been adding around 0.2% to GDP DP growth wow, for the last several years. And third, and finally, we also have fiscal policy even before we talk about Trump chips act, the inflation act, the infrastructure act have also been important tailwinds. So in summary, and sorry for giving a very long answer, but why is it no good answer. The economy has been so strong. It has to do with less interest rate sensitivity, a data center and AI boom, and finally also fiscal policy. And that’s the reason why even where we sit today, the Atlanta Fed GDP now estimate for Q4 is still at 3% well above the CBOs 2% estimate for long run GDP growth. And that is the reason why the s and p five hundreds have done so well the last few years. That’s the reason why credit spreads on IG higher than loans are so tight because we never got that slowdown that everyone worried so much about. And now we can then start talking about if we add Trump policies on top of this starting point, then you can begin to worry about that maybe there’s a rate acceleration both in inflation and in GDP in 2025 as a result of the starting point being just so strong at the moment. Barry Ritholtz: So there’s a couple of things you didn’t mention in contributing to the strength of of the US economy as well as some price support. And I wanna throw those at you. So you didn’t mention the massive fiscal spend during the Pandemic of CARES Act one and two under President Trump and CARES Act three under President Biden. Those were enormous. Is that pig through the Python? Are we still feeling the effect of that? Torsten Slok: Yeah, so those were also very important reasons why specifically the savings rate went up a lot in the household sector. So excess savings, you and I have been emailing these charts back and forth. Excess savings were really high exactly because of those fiscal policies giving a lot of money to households. And as households were running down those excess savings, this was also a very important tailwind to the outlook. So I do agree that those things have also played a very critical role in why the economic data has continued to be so strong. Even the last non-farm payrolls number we got was of course also very strong. And also, again, telling you that there are some tailwinds and that pick through the Python has played a critical role in keeping the economy strong for a much longer period than what your economics textbook would have predicted. Torsten Slok: So there’s, there’s so many different questions I wanna throw at you from that. You mentioned cars, you mentioned labor and you mentioned houses. All three of those sectors have a shortfall of supply. We stopped making cars for a couple years during the pandemic. So now we’ve ramped up enough new car production still means we have a shortfall of of pre-owned cars, housing, we underbuilt for a decade. There just doesn’t. And the the number of homes for sale close to record lows. And it feels like the labor pool is as tight as it’s ever been in our lifetimes. How significant are these supply issues to both growth and and pricing? Torsten Slok: They are very important. And there is this, as you and I also have talked about before, this academic debate about was inflation high because of supply or was it high because of demand? But exactly as you are outlining, it’s a much more complicated situation where you both have supply constraints for housing, for labor across the board in autos in many other sectors. Because during the pandemic we were simply not able to produce enough of what was needed for the economy to go at full capacity. So therefore we did have a decline in supply and at the same time we had a significant increase in demand, including from the fiscal policies that you just mentioned. And those things together were a very important reason why inflation went up. So now you are asking, looking into 2025, are these things still here? I would say they are still here to a very significant degree. And even before we’ve talked about Trump policies and tariffs and restrictions on immigration and lower corporate taxes. All these things are still pointing in my view to a situation where we are not out of the woods on inflation. The risk is that inflation could begin to see some lift simply because the Fed is now cutting and we still have tailwinds from fiscal policy, ai data center spending. We also have tailwinds from energy transition. And by the way, what we haven’t talked about either, we also have tailwinds from defense spending and we also of course have tailwinds from fiscal policy, the CHIPS act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the infrastructure act, and taken together all these things. Do point to your question, name me that there is still a chance that we might see inflation go up and therefore we might see the Fed potentially raise interest rates in 2025. So Barry Ritholtz: You’ve been very constructive on the economy for the past two years. A lot of economists were expecting a recession in 22, 23, 24. They haven’t gotten the recession they’ve been expecting. Why do you think the consensus was so wrong? Is it just that’s what the textbook said Torsten Slok: Exactly. I think we’ve been waiting for Gau for a long time and Gau basically has not arrived. And I don’t think he will arrive, at least not in 2025 because I think everyone took that textbook out exactly as you just said, Barry, and said, wow, when the Fed raises interest rates, then the probability of recession goes up. You actually see that on your Bloomberg screen. If you type ECFC, go and look in the upper right hand corner, you can see that the probability of recession immediately. When the Fed began to raise interest rates in March of 2022, the consensus began to lift higher significantly the probability of recession. And it was telling you that all the economists on the street who were looking at what is the implication if the Fed raises interest rates, they were saying it will absolutely be a recession. And what in my view was at least is clear today. And what’s the reason why we didn’t get it was because we all underestimated fiscal policy. We underestimated the excess savings, meaning the money that you just mentioned came into people’s bank accounts. And we also underestimated the interest rate insensitivity of the data center boom and also the interest rate insensitivity of energy transition and also the interest rate insensitivity of the fiscal policy from the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Auction Act. And those tailwinds have just kept the economy a lot stronger. So people underestimated that it was not just about interest rates going up, there were tailwinds that kept the economy afloat and a lot stronger than what really almost everyone expected. So Barry Ritholtz: In 2024, the Fed finally talking about waiting for Godot finally began cutting interest rates. You are one of the few economists who came out and said, Hey, the US economy is strong enough, we really don’t need rate cuts. Explain your thinking. Torsten Slok: Yeah. So we said, and we were wrong in the beginning of last year that the Fed would not cut rates in 2024, they did cut rates now a hundred basis points, it is still being debated. I know this sounds very academic, whether that was actually a good idea or not, but it is clear that the Fed did end up cutting interest rates with the main argument that inflation in June of 2022 was 9% and it had come down to around 3%. So the Fed concluded three years closer to our target of two. So this allows us to begin to cut interest rates. The problem is where we sit right now here, of course at the beginning of 2025, that well in the last few months, inflation has proven more sticky. The median CPI measure from the Cleveland Fed, the trim mean the various measures of acyclical, infl, inflation, and of course also various measures from the inflation from the the New York Fed that also looks at trends in underlying the UIP measure are saying that inflation is beginning to move more sideways and some indicators X beginning to move up. So again, even before we have spoken about Trump policies potentially giving a lift to even as if it’s modest lift to inflation, the problem is that inflation today is three and three is not two. And if I start at three and I begin to add a risk of a strong economy and I add a risk of both tariffs and restrictions on immigration, the risk is not that inflation goes down to two, but the risk is that three begins to become higher. So that’s why we still are in the camp of thinking that well, maybe we are still a little bit early in declaring victory over this issue on hey, inflation is no longer a problem because maybe inflation could come back in 2025 and we just don’t quite yet have it completely under control. And that’s what FMC members have been saying and speeches namely that, well, maybe we need to go a little bit more slowly and maybe we should even just take a pause and take a break and see, well, how long time will it take before inflation begins to show more signs of it actually continuously moving lower? Barry Ritholtz: Well, in the last presser, it’s pretty clear Jerome Powell wants to take a break, but it raises the question if all this is true about the strength of the US economy, and I completely agree with you, I I’ve been trying to figure out what is their thinking, why would they cut? And I kind of came up with two theories and I wanna bounce ’em off you. One is the bottom half of the economy really is feeling the effects of higher credit, whether it’s credit cards, automobile loans say nothing of new mortgage rates, and then second related to mortgage rates. So many people have locked in low rates, it’s almost a, a set of golden handcuffs and they’re stuck to that house that they can’t move out of because the financing costs of a newer house, a larger house or wherever they wanna move is just so much greater than where they are. All the supply is frozen in place remotely close or what do you think? Torsten Slok: Yeah, so the argument that the Fed or the FMC laid out for why they were cutting interest rates was simply that inflation had come down and their goal at the Federal Reserve is the dual mandate given by Congress. Namely they need to have inflation at 2% and they need to have full employment. And given inflation was closer to 2%, 3% is closer to two than nine is to two. They were saying we can begin to cut interest rates. But it’s absolutely clear what you’re saying that it was definitely the case and continues to be the case that who is it that is impacted when interest rates are high? It is people and balance sheets with a lot of debt. That is both the case in credit, meaning for firms, but that is also the case for households. Households that have a lot of debt are more vulnerable when interest rates are high. And who are the households, as you were just saying, who have more debt? That is by definition young households because when you’re young, you have more debt on your credit card, on your order loan, on your student loan on your mortgage. So if interest rates are higher for longer, it by definition has a more negative impact on lower income and younger households because when you’re young, you’re generally also lower income. So it is the reality, it’s not very comfortable for the Fed to talk about it this way, but it is with reality that fed policy has distributional consequences. It hurts those who have debt and it helps those who have assets. And that’s exactly the distribution across the income distribution across age, across FICO scores. Name me that if you are a low income low FCO and younger household, you have been hit harder by interest rates being higher. So that’s why when interest rates started to go down, that would likely not that this was the goal, but that would likely then be helping these households that have been harder hit and more negatively impacted by high interest rates. Barry Ritholtz: So we look at the inflation rate in the United States hanging around two and a half percent, little under three, whether it depends on whether you’re looking at CPI or CORE or PCE or whatever. Yep. But you look around the rest of the world X US, it’s like four point a half percent. Why does the rest of the world have so much higher of an inflation rate than we do here in the United States? Torsten Slok: Yeah, so one important answer to that is that Europe is unfortunately not in a particularly good situation relative to the us Europe is having the challenge that China is slowing down. Remember, China is slowing down for three reasons, slowing down because of demographic problems. Remember the workforce in China is about a billion people. And the United Nations is forecasting that over the next 10 years that will shrink from a billion to 900 million. That means that we are removing a hundred million people. Wow. In the Chinese workforce over the next decade, meaning a hundred million people, fewer working in the service sector, in the manufacturing sector, a hundred million people, fewer paying taxes, a hundred million people, fewer demanding housing and at different housing needs. All those things are a Japanese style headwind to Chinese growth overall, China is also having a deflating housing bubble. Existing home prices are falling 9% new home prices are falling 6%. And finally China is also engaged in a trade war not only with us but also with Europe. So because of the headwinds to China, we also have some headwinds, therefore to Germany in particular, but Europe, because Europe produces a lot of the assembly line in China. And if we don’t have that demand from China for assembly lines and for manufacturing goods and for capital intensive goods, that means that Europe is also in trouble. So the problem which you asked about is Germany, and therefore the European economy is not in a good place either. And the challenge now is that the service sector inflation in Europe is driven a lot by wage inflation because a lot of wages are basically directly spilling over and the service sector and therefore that’s how it’s measured when you measure inflation in services. And the conclusion is because of trade unions and while wage negotiations and bargainings being delayed, we still to this day have wage negotiations that are a function of what were in what inflation numbers for the last several years. And looking back, inflation was high. So that’s why with the delay, wage inflation is also high and therefore with the delay service sector inflation is also high. So it’s just because of some institutional reasons. Europe just has a different wage and price dynamic because of this delay in wage negotiations. And that is keeping inflation rates more elevated, especially in services inflation in Europe relative to what we are having in the US Now, Barry Ritholtz: I know the 30 year fixed mortgage is is you know, beloved here in the us most of Europe it’s, it’s a variable inflation, it’s a variable rate. How does that variable rate impact inflation in in Europe and how significant is that to their overall equivalent of CPI? Torsten Slok: And this is really, really important. I mean, as we spoke about earlier, I started my lovely career at the IMF and OECD and at the IMF and OED. Your job is actually quite simple. If the US is good, Europe is good, if the US is bad, Europe is bad. But this is not the case today. And exactly what you’re saying is a very important reason, namely that the interest rate sensitivity of the US economy is a lot lower simply because people have locked in interest rates. Whereas think about literally, as you mentioned, all other OECD countries in the uk, in France or Australia, Canada take the Bank of England, when interest rates go up, mortgage payments for households go up immediately. So that means that monetary policy has a much more immediate negative impact on the European and in this case, the UK economy than it does in the US simply because exactly the mortgage market is much more a function of short, short-term interest rates, the long-term interest rates. And why is that the case? That’s the case because in the US and you wrote a book about this many years ago, we have decided that for Fannie and Freddie, for you to get a conventional mortgage, you must show up at their doorstep with a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. You cannot show up with any other mortgage, then the government will not guarantee it. If you show up with that, they will guarantee it. So that means that the mortgage market is 95% of mortgages outstanding, a third year fixed. And that is simply not the case basically in any other OECD country. And that means the US has this unique feature that central bank or fed policy simply has less of an impact. It’s simply less potent relative to what you see, especially in Europe, but also again uk, Australia, Canada, and the rest of the OSD countries. Barry Ritholtz: You also dropped a data point that I have to follow up the billion to 900 million shift in in workers over the next decade. Essentially you’re saying China is losing a million workers a month for the next decade. Imagine, imagine if nine non-farm payroll came out each month and it was negative 850,000 people. That’s just an astonishing data point. Torsten Slok: And that Is exactly because of the one child policy that of course is beginning to catch up with the Chinese economy. So if you think about the consequences of the one child policy is of course that if you have a smaller population, the population will begin to shrink. And the consequence of course is that, that you will get really what I would describe as Japanese style headwinds from a demographic perspective, similar to what we have seen in Japan now for many decades. Barry Ritholtz: So we have a soft China, although Japan seems to be getting out of its own way and and doing pretty well. Yes, Europe is kind of struggling. The rest of the emerging market world seems to be doing okay outside of hotspots where there, where there are problems, how do you get to a 2.3% GDP in the US given all that challenging data points around the rest of the world. World? Yeah. Torsten Slok: So there are some very important aspects of this naming. The US is actually, and I know this sounds a little bit academic, but the US is actually the only economy in the world that’s a closed economy. And what I mean by that is that that’s an economy that does not depend too much on the rest of the world. You always talk about in the literature, in economics about the small open economy. So Denmark is a small open economy. Australia is a small open economy. Canada is actually also a small open economy because they depend on others. But the US really doesn’t depend to the same degree on others the way, the way that others depend on the us. And why is that important here? That’s very important because if we take the three reasons we talk about earlier, why the US is doing so well, less interest rate sensitivity, we have an AI and data center, boom, we have strong fiscal policies. 00:42:16 These are all things that we simply don’t have in other countries. Instead we have some significant headwinds to growth in other countries. So that means that at the aggregate level, the US continues to do well for some very idiosyncratic tailwinds and Europe and the rest of the world is not doing well from actually some different idiosyncratic headwinds. And now finally for markets, why is this important? Because if you think about it for the s and p 500, suddenly this becomes relevant what’s going on in the rest of the world because the s and p 500 is not the US GDP 40% of revenue and s and p 500 comes from abroad. So if apple sells fewer iPhones in Canada, in Europe, in Australia, that will have implications for apple’s earnings. Likewise, s and p 500 companies that sell things abroad. If the rest of the world is bad, that could be one way that this could begin to have negative consequences for the s and p 500. That’s not my baseline forecast, but I am getting more and more worried about this divergence with the US doing good and everyone else doing poorly. The consequence of that could be that that could ultimately show up in earnings because the s and p 500 is to a very significant degree against 40% of of of revenue in the s and p 500 comes from abroad. And if the abroad is not doing well, then the revenues from abroad will also begin to have a negative impact on earnings for s and p. 00:43:32 [Speaker Changed] Last international question before we jump to the new Trump administration. It’s kind of fascinating. Japan couldn’t get out of its own way for decades. Their market had peaked in 1989, took almost 30 years to to set new highs more more than 30 years. Why did Japan suddenly start performing not just the stock market but their economy Suddenly it looks like Japan is number two to the US and everybody else’s a distant third? Yeah, 00:44:05 [Speaker Changed] There are three reasons why Japan is doing so well at the moment. Number one is that the exchange rate has depreciated a lot and Japan is an exporting economy. It is again, a small open economy that is definitely experiencing a tailwind to economic growth from exports moving higher simply because of the depreciation in the exchange rate. The second reason is also that in Japan there’s actually been some quite fundamental changes in governance. There have been been some quite fundamental changes in the policy setup in terms of how at least the government talks about corporates and how they talk about finance. There is an increased willingness in Japan to give more support to basically people coming and buying companies, lending to companies. So that’s why private equity, private credit has been busy in Japan simply because it’s been getting a lot of policy support from politicians that want to change the governance in Japanese companies. 00:45:01 And third and finally, Japan is actually also, and this might sound a little bit peculiar, but they’re actually benefiting from some of the problems in China now that suddenly Japan is becoming, of course still a big manufacturing nation, but also now a place where more investment is taking place now that there have been these renewed worries about the outlook for China. So the short answer to your question is the exchange rate is supporting the Japanese economic outlook, changes in governance and changes in corporate finance. And the political support for activist investors has also been supportive for the Japanese outlook and for Japanese financial markets. And finally, Japan has also been benefiting for geopolitical reasons for the tailwinds coming because of some of the challenges that we are seeing in China at the moment. Huh, 00:45:44 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating. So we were talking about the state of the global economy, now we have a brand new president. Let’s start out just discussing how lucky this guy is to inherit for the second time an economy that to use your words, is firing on all cylinders. 00:46:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, the economy is actually in great shape today. We have an unemployment rate of 4.1%. GDP growth has for the last several quarters been around 3%. And that’s also what the Atlanta Fed GDP estimate now is for the fourth quarter. So the starting point is a fairly strong economy. The only little macroeconomic thing you can worry about is what we have talked about, namely inflation is still a little bit too high around 3% on CPI when it comes to both core and headline. And that’s of course the challenge here, namely an already strong economy and a little bit too elevated inflation. That’s the starting point for where we sit today. 00:46:41 [Speaker Changed] So I wanna talk about taxes and regulation and tariffs, but before we get there, I know President Trump focuses on the stock market to a lesser degree of the bond market. How do you think about valuations for both equities and fixed income here in the beginning of 2025? Well, 00:47:01 [Speaker Changed] If you, there are various ways of looking at that, but one simple way of looking at that is to go back and look at the sheer cyclically adjusted PE ratio. And this sheer cyclically adjusted PE ratio is basically, as you know too well, a complicated way of saying let’s try to take the business cycle out of earnings by taking a 10 year average of earnings for the last 10 years and ask the question, where is the stock market? Where is this in P 500 relative to a 10 year moving average of earnings? And the answer to that is that the Sheila cyclically adjusted PE ratio, which is an attempt to try to correct the stock market valuations for the business cycle, is currently at a very elevated 37. That means, remember in the long run the PE ratio for the s and p 500 is 16 over the last 50 years. So Sheila Cyclically adjusted so-called cape ratio at 37 is and 38 and approaching 40 is indeed a very, very elevated level of valuation. 00:47:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let me ask you two questions about that. First, we’re we’re not that far apart in age for most of our careers. Cape has been elevated almost the entire time. If you were not in equities because of an elevated cape, well you missed a hell of a move. 00:48:15 [Speaker Changed] It just happens to be the case that with the Trump presidency, this is the highest level of Cape at the start of any presidency going back in the last 50 years, huh? So that means that we are starting at an extremely elevated level of valuations, at least on this Sheila cyclically adjusted level. So let’s now turn to other things that are going on in the stock market. As you know, much better than me, 40% of this and P 500 is the top 10 stocks. You also know that most of the returns have been coming from really the Nvidia having great performance. And we also know very well that of course if you have such a high concentration of the magnificent seven and the top 10 biggest stocks in your index, this goes completely against page one. In my finance textbook, page one in my finance textbook says, you must diversify and if you take a hundred fresh dollars and put into this and P 500 today, you are not diversified. 00:49:03 You are basically betting on Nvidia, still having good earnings. And I love sitting there on a Wednesday afternoon looking at whether Nvidia earnings were good or were bad. And I love the adrenaline rush that comes with investing in Nvidia and a lot of other magnificent seven stocks. But the conclusion still is the same that, well, if I’m saving money for the the long run and I’m trying to do capital preservations, do I wanna expose myself to the risk that I will basically be putting all my money on red, namely on Nvidia and for that matter Tesla and the other names that are in the Magnificent seven still doing well, that could be that they will do well. There are also some arguments why they will not do well, but they’re certainly very expensive. And that’s an argument in my view for definitely being more diversified rather than just having exposure in s and p 500, mainly to those major names that have gotten so much attention. 00:49:50 [Speaker Changed] So could we make that same argument for, for a long time it was Intel and then it was Cisco and it seems like every decade you have this concentration at the top, but since the s and p 500 is market cap weighted, when and, and at one point in time, 25 years ago Cisco was the biggest stock in the s and p 500 and the NASDAQ 100, doesn’t it sort of automatically adjust as, as the company shrinks, you own less of it in, in the index and it, I, I don’t know if self-correcting is the right word, but it seems that you buy the whole basket, you’ll have the Nvidia along with a whole lot of other dogs. 00:50:28 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. I, I do think that’s absolutely correct, but that’s why where we’re sitting today, if we agree, and listeners don’t have to agree with this, but let’s say that at least some people think that the magnificent seven are very, very expensive. The trailing PE ratio for Tesla is 180. The trailing PE ratio for NVIDIA is like 60. The trailing PE ratio for Amazon is like 45. Remember again, the PE ratio has historically on average in the last 50 years, been 16. So if it is the case that these companies are expensive, I think that a more intelligent approach in my opinion would be to say we’re probably going to see some of these companies actually begin to fade and other companies begin to come in. It’s a hard issue to pick which ones it is, but maybe at least in this situation, let’s agree that maybe it may be a better strategy at least to buy the s and p 493 because at least I’m not exposed to those seven stocks that are so expensive. But 00:51:18 [Speaker Changed] By the equal weight and by the equal weight. That way you’re not 00:51:22 [Speaker Changed] Alternative. Yeah. So in that sense, I of course here, and I understand what you’re saying and I do know that the returns in the last two years have been coming to a very last degree from those specific stocks. But all I’m saying is that if we all agree that this is the case, why not take the consequence and then alternative you can, if you have to be in public equities, you could buy this and P 400, which is a way to have exposure not to the small cap companies. Remember in the Russell 2040% of companies have no earnings, right? So if interest rates are higher for longer and you have no earnings, that means that your coverage ratios are low. That means of course, that therefore you’re going to struggle more if interest rates aren’t indeed higher for longer. So I don’t like large cap because I think they’re so expensive. I don’t like small cap because I think they have no earnings. That’s why I think value stocks of companies in the middle, both in public and private space, but in this case, if you have to be in public, s and p 400 will be probably doing, at least in my reading, a better job relative to the other parts of the spectrum. So, 00:52:15 [Speaker Changed] So we hear during inauguration week, let’s talk a little bit about the new administration. Probably the we, we can’t go anywhere without starting with tariffs. How do you feel our trading partners are gonna respond to Trump’s tariffs? Is this, is he serious about this? Is this a negotiating tactic? How do you put this into your intellectual framework? 00:52:40 [Speaker Changed] So the tax foundation has quantified that if Trump does do 60% on China, 25% on Canada, 25% on Mexico, and 10% on Europe, we will get an overall level of tariffs that will go up to 18%, which is the same level that we had in the 1930s when we had trade wars and the economy was not doing very well. So if you do have a complete all in on all fronts when it comes to tariffs, then of course we should begin to worry about that. If everything we buy, you and me in stores goes up, quote unquote by 60% because now there’s 60% tariffs on China, then a good guess is that that means that sales by stores in the US is going to go down. And if sales start to go down, that means that GDP will also be at risk of going down. 00:53:23 So that’s why tariffs of course comes by definition with a stagflationary risk that you raise prices and you lower sales. So with that in mind, that doesn’t mean that we will not get tariffs. It doesn’t mean that we’ll get all in tariffs. No one really knows exactly how much we will get. But we do know that a very important aspect of this is that we also don’t know how the retaliation will be exactly as you’re highlighting from other countries. So that’s why tariffs overall and remains. We didn’t get any executive orders on tariffs other than saying that we will investigate it here, but we didn’t get any executive orders on tariffs on day one. So we’ll see how far we go and what will happen. But at this point, it’s very clear that if tariffs are imposed, it is something that the textbook would tell you that it would involve higher inflation and at the same time, downward pressure on GDP. 00:54:09 [Speaker Changed] And just to clarify that plus 60%, that’s not your forecast as to what’s gonna happen that’s hey, if what we’re discussing gets put into place. Exactly. This is the worst case scenario. 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] Exactly, because the thing is, these are the, I mean, Trump on the campaign trail talked about this in many different ways, but if this were to be implemented at 60% towards China, think about it. Everything you buy, your iPhone, your T-shirt, your clothing toys for your kids, everything would go up in theory by 60%. And that’s of course something that would have implications both for prices of those things, but also for the sales of those things. 00:54:43 [Speaker Changed] What about the restrictions on immigration, both legal and illegal? 00:54:48 [Speaker Changed] So pure estimates that there are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the US and roughly half of them probably have a job. So that’s around 6 million. Total employment in the US is about 160 million. So if there’s 160 million people in the US in total that have a job and 6 million of these are illegal immigrants, that means if you remove millions of people with through deportations, you will remove like two, three, 4% of the workforce. And Pew and others, American Immigration Council, they find that where do illegal immigrants work? They work in three sectors, agriculture, construction, and restaurants or services. So the consequence of this, it’s up to 14% of workers in agriculture and construction who are illegal immigrants. And if this is the case, then of course means that you will likely see wage inflation in construction, wage inflation in agriculture and wage inflation in restaurants. So that also means that if we do get deportations, even if we get restrictions on immigration, that’s very meaningful. 00:55:43 In particular because the starting point is a very strong economy. The consequence is that I will begin to worry again about not only overheating in inflation, but maybe also overheating in the labor market if you remove workers and suddenly there are fewer workers left to compete for their available jobs. And that could exactly be why you’re beginning to see in the jolts that job openings are actually beginning to move higher because it could be that there’s already some issues around what is the labor market going to look like if we are going down a road where we may see deportations or some very significant restrictions on immigration. 00:56:15 [Speaker Changed] Alright, so those first two are the negative policies. Let’s talk about potentially positive policies like corporate tax cuts and deregulation. How do you see that impacting the economy in the markets? 00:56:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so if we rewind just for a second and think back to 2017 where the corporate tax rates were lower from 35 to 21%, I remember household taxes were lower from 39.6 to 37%. In 2017, we saw both household taxes came down and corporate taxes came down. And now Trump has talked about lowering corporate taxes on domestic manufacturers in addition to from 21, but all the way down to 15%. That means that manufacturers will now see if this happens, of course, a tailwind to production. Just as a footnote, as you and I of course also talk about often manufacturing is actually only about 10% of GDP and 10% of employment. So it’s a little bit special that a sector that’s only 10% of the economy continues to get so much attention. But nevertheless, the definition of Make America great again is probably that manufacturing should come back. 00:57:14 And if that’s the case, even though it only makes up 10% of GDP lowering corporate taxes for domestic manufacturers would indeed also be something that’s positive. So that policy alone would be a lift to inflation and also a lift to GDP. And on deregulation, of course, we don’t know quite exactly what deregulation is going to look like if it’s for financial services, if it’s for energy, if it’s for transportation, we remains to be seen what area it will be in. But broadly speaking, of course, deregulation would also be releasing animal spirits. It would also be boosting GDP growth and it would actually, ultimately, deregulation normally would be putting downward pressure on inflation, at least in the longer run. So those policies, exactly as you’re saying, Barry would certainly be tailwinds in particular GDP growth. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] So you’ve discussed policy uncertainty as a potential concern because we have no idea what the tariffs are gonna look like, what the deregulation will look like, at least there’s some specificity with manufacturing corporate tax rates and exactly where, where the president wants those to go. How do you deal with the variability of, Hey, we have no idea what this looks like. How do you build a model with so many unknowns built into it? Yeah, 00:58:31 [Speaker Changed] This is indeed very complicated from a forecasting perspective. There is no room in my Excel spreadsheet for the US economic outlook to stuff in uncertainty. I can have, and I do have various small Mickey Mouse models where VIX and the move index and volatility measures are included, but they are not a central part of the overall outlook, simply because as you’re saying, we just don’t know exactly how to quantify that risk. But that being said, it is still the case that if there is uncertainty, that does obviously have implications for business planning, for household planning. If you don’t know what’s coming, if you don’t know exactly what the nature of policies is going to look like, then of course it does bring some elevated levels of risk that people may be holding back with doing things they otherwise would have done simply because of the uncertainty of everything from immigration policies, tax policies, tariffs, and all the other things that we have talked about. So that’s why policy uncertainty is something that is holding back investment and spending decisions by households and by firms. 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] So we talked earlier about CapEx. How significant are administration policies to corporate America spending and investing and and building out what is likely to be the next generation of of economic drivers? 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think that there are two dimensions to that issue. Namely, first of all, we already have in place a number of important tailwinds to CapEx and business spending, namely AI and data center. Boom, it doesn’t matter what the fit funds rate is doing, we will have an AI and data center boom no matter what interest rates are doing because everyone wants to invest and should be investing in ai. Secondly, we probably also have energy transition because energy is needed to power the data centers. I also think strongly this is getting financing, including from us at Apollo, long-term investments in energy transition, long-term investments in data centers because these long-term investments are simply needed and this is something that needs to be done. We will also have a structural tailwind also from property defense. Defense spending has been going up. The rest of the world is also spending more on defense. 01:00:30 Again, that is also something that is humming in the background supporting growth overall. Now specifically to different policies, obviously with deregulation, obviously with tax cuts, obviously broadly speaking, with policies that are America first and make America great again, we’ll probably from a cyclical perspective also be giving a boost to CapEx spending domestically. One way of saying the cyclical part of the outlook is really that the animal spirits that have been released after Trump was elected, now that companies have, at least the view seems to be that there’s a more business friendly environment. And for that reason, more business spending will be taking place is from a cyclical perspective adding to the other structural things that I just listed. So that’s a reason to be actually quite bullish overall on the CapEx and business spending outlook. 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned defense, you mentioned energy. What about technology and what about crypto seems to have found a, a whole new tailwinds with the the most recent election? 01:01:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so that’s of course a lot more complicated and and more recently we got a coin both from the president and of course also from Melania. And this is raising of course, some different questions about the the crypto world more generally. But I will say that the technology and blockchain and investment in AI and investment, generally speaking and getting more productive and doing things more productively and efficiently is certainly something that is here to stay. And I think that that broadly speaking is also a tailwind to the overall outlook. 01:02:01 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really fascinating. I only have you for a couple of more minutes, let’s jump to our favorite questions that I get to ask all of my guests. It’s great having that baseline of what everybody else has said, but let’s just start really simply, what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you watching or listening to? So 01:02:21 [Speaker Changed] One of my favorite podcasts of course is Masters in Business. 01:02:24 [Speaker Changed] Stop Enough. Okay. 01:02:25 [Speaker Changed] But that’s true. I know you to more than 500 episodes. I can’t believe it. It’s 10 years ago since I sat with you here last time. 01:02:31 [Speaker Changed] I know when I first began, I had dark hair. Now it’s great. 01:02:34 [Speaker Changed] I think, well, I actually had hair, so I think that I was perhaps one of your first customers here in the studio, but I do That’s correct. Also, listen to, we have actually our own view from Apollo podcast, but I also watch, one series that I’ve been watching is the Jaal on Peacock, which is basically very, very James Pon like series about a guy who’s going around Europe and doing all kinds of things and And what’s the name of that jackal? The Jacque 01:03:03 [Speaker Changed] Jackal 01:03:04 [Speaker Changed] Oral? Yeah, the Jaal. How are you pronounce it? Here comes my 01:03:07 [Speaker Changed] Dan Dan accent. Like the spy novel. The jackal, exactly. 01:03:10 [Speaker Changed] Oh 01:03:10 [Speaker Changed] Really? I’m trying to remember who wrote that. Oh, 01:03:12 [Speaker Changed] So, but there was, this was originally a movie in France in the 1970s, but this is something that’s playing now on Peacock. And I have been watching, this is like, I think it’s eight episodes and he’s traveling around Europe. It’s really fascinating. It’s actually, it’s really well done. 01:03:26 [Speaker Changed] We mentioned Binky earlier. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:03:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, my first mentor was my professor in economics in Copenhagen. His name is Neil Terson. He just turned 90, and I celebrated his birthday here in December. But he was the one that really put me on track to thinking about economics. I did my PhD with him and he sent me that year to Princeton. And he was the one who got me going first. And then when I joined the IMF, pinky was there. There were also several others. David Lan also played a very important role. And there was also another, actually happened to be Danish guy. His name is Fleming Lazen. He’s now retired, who was also a very important mentor for me. And then when I came to the OECD, I worked very closely together with a gentleman called Vincent Cohen, who’s actually still there also. And also another colleague, Alanis is who’s also still there. 01:04:14 So they have all been teaching me various ways of how do you think about things, the importance of a framework, the importance of what are the arguments that we put up on the scale for something happening. There are some arguments why the stock market may be going up. There’s some arguments why the stock market may be going down. Let’s try to have a systematic approach to how it is that we talk about things. So that’s been very influential. And finally, on, on, on Wall Street or in Deutsche Bank, and of course also here, Apollo, everyone around me and living in the private sector and the commercial world. And of course, very importantly also here, thinking about investing in private assets, not least my current CEO Mark Rowan. And the inspiration in terms of how he is really, in my view, a genius. Changing the financial system and moving things in the, in the direction that’s the future of finance is playing a very important impact and playing a very important role and having an important impact on my thinking also today. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really fascinating. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:05:13 [Speaker Changed] So I have been reading, and I just finished the Two Parent Privileged by Melissa Kearney. And that has to do with this, of course, unique discussion around what does it mean to have two parents? What does it mean to have one parent? What are the differences from a sociological perspective for different types of organizing yourself as a family? This has been, it was very interesting and and quite eye-opening when you think about a lot of different things going on in society today. Hmm. 01:05:44 [Speaker Changed] Give us one other, what’s one of your all time favorites? 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, well, of course there’s your book after the bailout. Okay. So now we have, just to make sure for that, to make sure we have that on the record. But I think that broadly speaking, I spend a lot of my time just getting back to Square the circle here in terms of what we spoke about earlier. I do spend a lot of my time reading the economists, reading newspapers, try to come up with ideas for daily sparks. I try to think about questions I get from clients, questions I get internally. Can we get data with this? I ask my team, which several of them are sitting in India, Hey, can you overnight come up with a chart on this, on that? Can we find data for how many people go to Broadway shows? Can we find data for all kinds of things that I would normally try to say, well, we can’t really find any data for this, but let’s try to dig a little bit deeper and see if there is any data that can help us. So I do also spend my a lot of my time on Twitter, social media, reading newspapers, watching Bloomberg shows and figuring out what are we talking about? What data do we have? Is this conversation correct or are there actually ways where we should take this conversation in a different direction because there are other dimensions that are more important. Huh. Really, 01:06:52 [Speaker Changed] Really fascinating. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either economics or finance? 01:07:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I think this is of course a very important question, but I would say read the Economist, watch Bloomberg Surveillance. Listen to podcasts like Masters in business, try to do the homework that is really, really hard. And we have all been through this process. You will feel that it’s quote unquote not rewarded, but you will learn more and more. You will get to know and understand more and more, and in particular, given how the world is moving with private markets becoming more and more important, try to understand and get a good understanding on what is private equity, what is private credit? How, what is the evolution in private markets? How is that relative to public markets? Try to get a broader view on what does finance mean and where is finance going? And that can really only be done by reading your textbooks, trying to stay up to date on recent developments. The textbooks in some cases are a little bit behind, but really trying to listen and try to think hard about and lean back in your chair, go for a long walk in a green park and think about, okay, what is it that I have just learned? What is it that I’ve just been told? And how does that fit in with my view of what is overall the outlook for financial markets? And how should I think about how the financial system hangs together? Huh, 01:08:13 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 30 years ago or so when you were first getting started? 01:08:23 [Speaker Changed] Well, this is something that’s very important and close to my heart because what I had not appreciated until recently is the very important part that private markets play. So there are 6 million businesses in the US with employment. So that’s a complicated way of saying there are 6 million businesses that have workers working inside those businesses. And why is that important? Because we spend so much time on the s and p 500 and we study these companies incredibly in incredible detail. And you then turn around and say, okay, those 500 companies are really interesting. But what about the remaining 5.9 million companies that are not in s and p 500? How do they get financing? Who owns them? How do they get financing for expanding? If they want to build a new factory, how do they get financing? If they wanna hire more workers, how do they get financing if they want to expand in another country and private markets? 01:09:15 And the role of private markets? I wish that I, earlier on in my macroeconomic career, had spent some more time thinking much more deeper around what is it that’s going on in everything else than in the s and p 500? Because remember, of total employment in the us, total employment in the s and p 500 companies in very round numbers is about 25 million people. And total employment in the US is 160 million people. So it is only in round numbers around 20% of employment in the US economy that is in the s and p 500. And that’s a very high estimate because s and P also employs people outside the us. So that means that 80% of employment in the US is outside the s and p 500. What do these people do? How do we measure them? And what businesses do they work in? And do they have the financing? Can they get the financing? How do they get growth so that the economy can growth also outside the s and p 500? 01:10:05 [Speaker Changed] Thorsten. This has been absolutely fascinating. I really appreciate how generous you’ve been with your time. We have been speaking with Torsten Slack. He is the chief economist and partner at Apollo Global Management. If you enjoy this conversation, well be sure and check out any of the previous 530 we’ve done over the past 10 and a half years.

Posted on 02/04/2025 4:58:32 AM PST by marcusmaximus The Kremlin on Tuesday called US President Donald Trump's plans to exchange Ukrainian rare earth minerals for further military aid a “commercial proposal.” -snip- “Well, probably, if we call a spade a spade, this is an offer to buy aid, that is, not to continue to provide it on a gratuitous or other basis, but to provide it on a commercial basis,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow. “It is better, of course, not to provide assistance at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,” Peskov further said. He said that the essence of Trump's ideas regarding a settlement in Ukraine are unclear, but that it is obvious US arms supplies to Kyiv will continue as none have declared otherwise. He went on to say the new US administration has not yet made any decisions on the possibility of returning Russian diplomatic property seized by Washington, stressing that Moscow will take reciprocal measures should Poland try to seize such property.

Buying “outright “ still gives money to Zand Ukraine. However if you mean trade minerals for money or weapons, then I agree. In addition to new weapons we have lots of surplus we can trade, but to do that, Putin needs to return to his 2013 borders. Something he cannot do and survive. Still think there is a good chance that China will annex much of eastern Russian “federation”.

In addition to new weapons we have lots of surplus we can trade, but to do that, Putin needs to return to his 2013 borders. Something he cannot do and survive.

He went on to say the new US administration has not yet made any decisions on the possibility of returning Russian diplomatic property seized by Washington, stressing that Moscow will take reciprocal measures should Poland try to seize such property.

Title: Bitcoin Set For $150 Billion Inflow As Trump Pushes Sovereign Fund: Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-150-billion-inflow-trump-sovereign-fund/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T12:00:46Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin could see unprecedented capital inflows ranging from $150 billion to $500 billion as US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday mandating the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund. The initiative—which did not explicitly reference BTC during its announcement—will be helmed jointly by US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. The US sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is expected to be created within the next 12 months. Although official details remain sparse, market observers note that both Lutnick and Bessent have been vocal supporters of Bitcoin, prompting speculation that the nascent fund could include digital assets. Well-known BTC advocate Florian Bruce-Boye offered a sweeping outlook via X, suggesting the upcoming US sovereign wealth fund is destined to become “the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world in the long term.” He stated: “The USA will create a sovereign wealth fund. It is set to become the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world in the long term. That would be $2 trillion dollars. That is as big as BTC itself. With H. Lutnick and S. Bessent at the helm, it is highly likely that Bitcoin will be included in this sovereign wealth fund.” Bruce-Boye pointed to the personal investment profiles of both Lutnick and Bessent, emphasizing their favorable views on Bitcoin. According to his statements, Lutnick “has hundreds of millions in BTC and, according to his own statements, buys every dip,” while Bessent “sees Bitcoin as a freedom technology.” Drawing further parallels, Bruce-Boye highlighted how Norway’s $1.8 trillion fund and Saudi Arabia’s $1 trillion fund could add “another 1.5 times the market capitalization of Bitcoin” if they follow suit. He referenced a recent comment from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who mentioned a sovereign wealth fund seeking guidance on whether to invest “2% or 5%” in BTC. Bruce-Boye concluded by quantifying the possible capital flow: “3% of $4.8 trillion dollars is $150 billion. At current prices, that’s around 1.5 million BTC… And that’s only if the three largest build up a small position. Anyone who has not yet ‘studied’ Bitcoin should do so as soon as possible.” Echoing a similar optimism, Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer posted: “The US Sovereign Wealth Fund should reach $5T AUM pretty quickly. For context, Norway’s fund holds $2T, and they have a population of 6M people. 10% allocation to Bitcoin makes sense, so that’s about $500B buying over the next couple of years. Bullish.” Fahrer’s estimate pushes the potential inflow even higher, implying that if the US fund does indeed adopt a strategic BTC allocation, it could trigger a multi-year wave of institutional demand. Jeff Walton, digital capitalist and founder of True North, underscored the significance of Howard Lutnick’s leadership in a separate X post. Lutnick, who serves as both the US Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is known for his substantial personal position in BTC. Walton wrote: A couple of fun details about Howard and Cantor Fitzgerald: 1. Howard owns “hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin, and it’s going to be Billions” 2. Cantor Fitzgerald owns a 5% stake in Tether, and manages Tether’s treasury assets 3. Cantor is launching a $2 Billion Bitcoin financing lending business, that would use Bitcoin as collateral for USD loans. 4. “We will build the best platform for financing Bitcoin” 5. “We are Cantor Fitzgerald, and we will support Bitcoin” For now, the global BTC market watches and waits, aware that even a modest allocation from the incoming US sovereign wealth fund could reshape the landscape —and possibly herald a new wave of institutional participation worldwide. At press time, BTC traded at $99,450. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Are Trump and his supporters ready for a fight to the death?
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-02-04-are-trump-and-his-supporters-ready.html
Time Published: 2025-02-04T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
(Article byÂ Paul Craig Roberts republished from PaulCraigRoberts.org) In an article in the current issue of theÂ City Journal, âCounterrevolution Blueprint,â Christopher F. Rufo, describes the extent to which the US government is in the hands of the enemy.Â Â In the 2020 presidential electionÂ employees of the Justice (sic) Department, gave 86 percent of their political contributions to Democrats.

Janet Yellen, the Jewish Secretary of the Treasury, and Kamala Harris, the black Vice President, quickly announced a $8.7 billion fund for lending only to minority-owned businesses, a blatantly discriminatory policy in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment.Â Â You can imagine how many âminority-ownedâ firms were quickly created Â so that âdeservingâ people could be made millionaires by the US taxpayers.Â Â And you can rest assured that neither Yellen nor Harris were held accountable for violating law and the Constitution. Not even this was enough. The Treasury forced federal contractors to implement DEI and monitored tax returns to make sure that tax-exempt donations to charities were racially balanced.

Rufo makes it clear that if Trump 2 fails, âthe American experiment will come to an end: bureaucratic rule will devour the constitutional order.â I certainly agree, having made many of these points myself.Â Â The question is:Â Â How realistic is it that Trump and a few appointees can subdue millions of people whose far-left ideology is guiding the US government and who not only despise Trumpâs view of America but also hate Trump personally.Â Â It is impossible for Trump to achieve unity with ideologues supported by the Democrat Party who are totally opposed to his view of America. The competence and objectivity of the civil service, long under liberal attack, was finished off when the Clinton regime pushed the white male senior civil service into early retirement in order to âmake roomâ for blacks and females.

Read more at:Â PaulCraigRoberts.org During the Biden regime another activist left-wing bureaucracy was created in the Treasury, an Equity Hub with a Counselor for Racial Equity. Janet Yellen, the Jewish Secretary of the Treasury, and Kamala Harris, the black Vice President, quickly announced a $8.7 billion fund for lending only to minority-owned businesses, a blatantly discriminatory policy in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment.Â Â You can imagine how many âminority-ownedâ firms were quickly created Â so that âdeservingâ people could be made millionaires by the US taxpayers.Â Â And you can rest assured that neither Yellen nor Harris were held accountable for violating law and the Constitution. Not even this was enough. The Treasury forced federal contractors to implement DEI and monitored tax returns to make sure that tax-exempt donations to charities were racially balanced. Rufo describes the efforts of Nixon, Reagan, and Trump 1 to get the bureaucracy in compliance with the Presidentâs policy.Â Â All failed.Â Â Nevertheless, Rufo has hope for Trump 2, and he sets out the necessary elements for taking back the Presidentâs and the peopleâs power from a hostile civil service that is united against American values and are substituting the values of cultural marxism in their place. Rufo makes it clear that if Trump 2 fails, âthe American experiment will come to an end: bureaucratic rule will devour the constitutional order.â I certainly agree, having made many of these points myself.Â Â The question is:Â Â How realistic is it that Trump and a few appointees can subdue millions of people whose far-left ideology is guiding the US government and who not only despise Trumpâs view of America but also hate Trump personally.Â Â It is impossible for Trump to achieve unity with ideologues supported by the Democrat Party who are totally opposed to his view of America. The competence and objectivity of the civil service, long under liberal attack, was finished off when the Clinton regime pushed the white male senior civil service into early retirement in order to âmake roomâ for blacks and females. It was part of âaffirmative action.â The DEI legions have been growing for decades.Â Â They are firm in their belief that white heterosexuals are racist, and they intend to finish the process started with discriminatory âaffirmative actionâ to make normal white Americans second class citizens in law and position.

Title: Analysis-Europe's AI bulls pin hopes on 'Jevons Paradox' after DeepSeek rout

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: By Lucy Raitano LONDON (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence bulls in Europe are dusting off a 160-year-old economic theory to explain why the boom in the sector's stocks may have further to run, despite the emergence of China's cheap AI model DeepSeek. Tech stocks worldwide plunged on Jan. 27 after the launch of DeepSeek - apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less sophisticated chips - raised questions over the West's huge investments in chipmakers and data centres. At the heart of the selloff was U.S. advanced chipmaker and AI poster-child Nvidia, which lost 17% of its value, or close to $600 billion, in the largest one-day drop in market capitalisation for any company on record. Since then, tech stocks have rebounded, with European markets hitting new highs, and a 19th century economic theory is suddenly on everyone's lips: the Jevons Paradox. Named after English economist William Stanley Jevons, it posits that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, demand can increase - rather than decrease - as the price to use the resource drops. "I hadn’t discussed it until Monday (last week), and then suddenly it’s everywhere," said Helen Jewell, Chief Investment Officer at BlackRock Fundamental Equities, EMEA. "This paradox highlights one of the uncertainties at the moment," said Jewell, flagging that a key question for European stock-pickers is whether data centres and their suppliers will be less in demand. "One of the big question marks from (last) Monday’s news is how much energy is going to be needed for the AI revolution?" The selloff hit direct and indirect AI plays alike. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML, and sector peers ASMI and BE Semi all fell 7%-12% on Jan. 27, before recouping losses later in the week, as did Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure. "Jevons Paradox strikes again!" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a post on X. "As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of." THE NEW BUZZWORD On Friday, Tomasz Godziek, portfolio manager of the Tech Disruptors fund at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said lower AI costs could exemplify the Jevons Paradox. "Ultimately, this could fuel a new wave of AI investment, creating fresh opportunities, particularly in software and inference technologies," Godziek said. Portfolio managers at Thematics Asset Management, an affiliate of Natixis IM, cited Jevons Paradox as one reason they believe demand for AI chips may remain healthy. Mark Hawtin, head of the Liontrust global equities team, also said his investment thesis on AI was reinforced by the news on Jan. 27, flagging the paradox. "Everyone has become an expert on Jevons Paradox," said Aviva Investors portfolio manager Kunal Kothari, who manages a UK equity income fund with around 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in assets. "The falling cost of improved productivity through GenAI will likely benefit companies in the UK market generally, as they will predominantly be consumers of these technologies," he added, pointing to data and software names like RELX, LSEG, Experian and Sage as likely beneficiaries. DATA CENTRE NEEDS IN FOCUS The need for data centres and the vast amounts of power required to run them has driven a lot of AI investing in Europe already, given that there aren't any homegrown rivals to the likes of Nvidia, whose shares have rocketed by about 200% in under two years. "There is an implicit assumption that the adoption and usage of AI would require increasingly more chips, and more data centre capacity and power consumption," said Kasper Elmgreen, CIO of fixed income and equities at Nordea Asset Management. "What DeepSeek has done is to question what is required from that route and what can be delivered by making much better software." Not everyone is convinced of the new rationale, including Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho EMEA. "Whilst many Nvidia optimists pointed to Jevons Paradox to help them sleep better at night ... it was less convincing in the short term after what has been a meteoric rise in Nvidia shares," he wrote in a note.

Title: Should you withdraw your money from poorly performing property funds, or wait it out?

Their investments may be dropping in value but many investors in Irish property funds are finding themselves stuck as restrictions on cashing in their investments remain in place. It’s a far cry from the heady days of the Celtic Tiger, when commercial property funds were the best-performing asset class – outperforming even Irish equities. While property funds struggled in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they turned it around but the environment has become challenging once more. After a buoyant 2015, when Irish Life’s fund returned almost 20 per cent, it has been in the red for four of the last five years. Similarly, both Zurich Life and New Ireland’s funds had negative returns in the year to January 6th, with Aviva’s fund the only one of the four in the black – with a return of just 0.2 per cent. Suzie Nolan, head of property with Aviva, says the life and pensions company’s property fund is facing “similar challenges evident in the wider Irish property market”. These include economic threats such as inflation as well as geopolitical uncertainty. The move towards working from home, and its consequent impact on demand for office space, as well as the ever-increasing requirement for landlords to provide more sustainable space have also had an impact. Funds started restricting withdrawals back in spring 2023, as a sharp change in direction on interest rates at the European Central Bank saw a surge in the number looking to withdraw their money. They feared increased funding costs could lead to project writedowns that could push down the valuation of such funds. It is not unusual for property funds to stop access to withdrawals, though that doesn’t mean investors are any happier to find themselves locked in at an inopportune time in the cycle. They typically carry warnings, like that of Zurich Life: “If you invest in this fund, there may be extended periods when you do not have any access to your money. “This means you could be waiting for a significant period of time before you are able to encash your investment,” Zurich Life says. And that is precisely the case at the moment. Irish Life has had a six-month waiting period on withdrawals since March 2023, while Zurich Life has now stopped investments both in – and out – of its fund. A spokesman says that “no inflows are permitted into the Zurich Property Fund, and a waiting period applies for withdrawals or switches out. The fund is reviewed on a regular basis and the restrictions for inflows and outflows may change in the future”. This means that the fund is shrinking, down from about €33 million in March 2023 to about €18 million as of August this year. Aviva introduced a moratorium of up to six months back in November 2023, due to “net outflows” from the fund and, according to a spokeswoman, this still applies. The holdings of the fund, which merged with the Friends First Irish Commercial Property fund back in May 2022, include: Blackrock Village Centre and Zurich House, both in Blackrock in south Dublin; the Globe retail park in Naas, Co Kildare; and 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2, which is currently available for letting. Typically, a fund will introduce a notice period to give fund managers time to make any property sales needed to pay future withdrawals. Often, funds will move to restrict withdrawals if cash reserves decline. Normally property funds keep a buffer of about 10 to 15 per cent of assets in cash to meet the demand for withdrawals. This time around, however, most of the funds are cash rich. New Ireland, for example, has 23.4 per cent in cash; Zurich Life has more than a quarter of its assets in cash, according to its most recent report; and Aviva has 12.2 per cent. New Ireland, which had a restriction, is one of the few funds with no restrictions. A spokesman says the New Ireland Property Fund is open to new investment, and there are no restrictions on withdrawals and switches. So should investors apply to withdraw their funds or wait it out? Well, the issue here can be that, depending on the fund, the request will be processed only at the end of the deferral period and at the unit price of the fund at that time – ie the unit price after the six-month deferral, not the unit price at the time the instruction was given. As a result, you are taking a gamble on where the price will go. You might also be faced with an early encashment penalty, so check the small print before making a decision. Many funds have also changed how they are being priced. New Ireland’s fund, for example, is priced on a disposal basis, “which ensures that policyholders exiting the fund pay their fair share of property acquisition costs” the spokesman says. This has been the case since 2020. This can happen when more money is going out of the fund than coming in, and is a strategy used to contain losses. At a time of growth, when a fund is expanding and purchasing assets, it will usually be priced on an acquisition basis. Moving to a disposal basis can be bad news for investors, especially in a market downturn; when New Ireland made the change it cut the unit price of the fund by as much as almost 8 per cent. Given an overall office vacancy rate in Dublin of about 16 per cent – up from about 5 per over the last five years – the city now has one of Europe’s highest rates. This is also reflected in the property funds. Irish Life’s vacancy rate is less than 10 per cent, while New Ireland’s is 9.7 per cent and Aviva’s is 8.4 per cent (which includes 3 per cent of strategic vacancy for redevelopment purposes). Funds also have run into difficulty when trying to offload properties. Irish Life acquired 1 Harbourmaster Place, KPMG’s current headquarters in the IFSC, back in 2015 for €50 million. It put it back on the market in 2020 for €54 million but it failed to sell. Now KPMG is set to move to Hibernia Reit’s development in Harcourt Square, and the lease on 1 Harbourmaster is due up in 2026. Despite the challenges however, fund managers remain upbeat about the future. State Street Global Advisors, which manages New Ireland’s fund, expects a bump in transactions as interest rates fall, which will lead to a “closer alignment of buy and sell side pricing expectations” – in other words more competitive prices. It also expects vacancy rates to fall in the office sector. “Despite offices generally being out of favour with investors in recent years, there are now signs that interest in the sector is turning” Aviva’s Nolan expects more stability in valuations this year, “with the possibility of some upward movements in certain subsectors, such as retail parks, as new rental evidence becomes available”. And she expects more economic opportunities to come through in 2025, such as the reducing cost of debt and a widening of the spread between bond rates and property yields, “both of which should be an impetus for further investment in the property sector”, she says. Aviva itself expects to be busy, with projects including the redevelopment of a site in Dundalk to deliver a primary care centre for the Health Service Executive expected to start this year, alongside other “value-add initiatives”, such as further letting activity and the rolling out of additional sustainability programmes.

Title: Bitcoin Recovers Above $100,000 After This Weekend’s Sharp Drop

Bitcoin prices climbed back above $100,000 today. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin bounced back on Monday, February 3, rising above $100,000 once again after falling to nearly $90,000 over the weekend. The world’s most valuable digital currency reached roughly $102,600 close to 5 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up more than 10% from the recent low of close to $91,000 it attained on Sunday, February 2, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView show. When explaining the digital asset’s latest price movements, analysts cited several factors, including the recent tariff announcements, supply-demand dynamics and also the impact of speculative bets being liquidated. One market observer who weighed in on these developments is the the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. “Over the weekend President Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China,” she noted via email. “Since this was announced on 2/1/2025, Saturday, this caused a lot of fear for crypto traders on how this could impact traditional markets.” “Many, including Blackrock have indicated that Bitcoin is an ideal asset during volatile times of economic uncertainty, similar to Gold,” she emphasized. The analyst also emphasized sharp changes in leveraged positions, citing data provided by crypto analytics platform CoinGlass. “According to CoinGlass most traders took a long position and out of the historic $2.2B liquidations, ~$1.5B longs were liquidated while gold hit an all-time high,” Wendy noted. “This indicates Bitcoin traders, may have anticipated that Bitcoin would continue with bullish price action as uncertain economic conditions could have occurred Monday due to Trumps tariffs (similar to gold)." "However, the 25% tariffs placed on Mexican imports has been paused for the next 30 days which could indicate less volatility,” she stated, emphasizing today’s announcement that President Donald Trump was postponing tariffs on Mexico until early next month. Markets also found out today that Trump planned to pause the Canadian tariffs he announced over the weekend after speaking with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Certain analysts who offered input for this article made today’s increase in bitcoin prices seem predictable given existing market conditions. “Bitcoin’s recovery to $100K and above is no surprise—it’s simple supply and demand,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and everyday people are realizing fiat’s inevitable decline and moving into the best money ever invented,” he added. “Weak hands sold in the recent dip, but strong holders stepped in, stacking harder,” Klippsten stated. “Meanwhile, global uncertainty is driving more people to opt out of failing fiat. This is just the beginning.” Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also weighed in. “Today’s rebound was simply a recovery from the absurd drop yesterday,” he stated through email. “In most cases, the correlation with certain fiat markets works against Bitcoin; yesterday, had US equities markets been open, it would have worked very much in favor of BTC,” Enneking emphasized. “The drop on Sunday hit ridiculous proportions because there was nothing to slow it down and fear totally dominated greed; the drop only slowed once Asia markets had opened and had totally reversed several hours after US markets had done the same,” he stated. “So, billions of long positions wiped out and another data point created for folks who are considering investing in the crypto ecosystem,” Enneking concluded. Alex Lin, cofounder and general partner at venture capital firm Reforge, also weighed in, highlighting the strong interest of cryptocurrency buyers. “BTC’s rebound above $100,000 after its weekend lows points to a significant supply squeeze,” he wrote through emailed comments. “Over the past few days, retail investors capitulated due to fears sparked by Trump’s trade war headlines. However, large players and institutions took advantage of the dip to accumulate, as shown by the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which indicated strong buyer demand with a noticeable premium,” Lin stated. “This activity underscores BTC’s resilience and suggests potential bullish momentum, especially as confidence in the broader market outlook remains strong,” he added.

Title: Searching For Yield in All of The Safe Places

What kind of investor are you? Do you want yield, safety, yield with a reasonable risk, or total return? I created a ranking system to combine Risk, Yield, Return, Quality, Trend, and Tax-Efficiency factors into an overall rating. I used yield divided by Ulcer Index which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns to limit the number of categories that I evaluate. My favorites may not be the same as yours. Table #1 shows how I rank the categories. I will be discussing each Lipper Category in the order of the “Overall” column. Approximately 10% of my bond investments are in six of the eight categories but the bulk of my bond investments are in bond ladders and core bonds along with diversification into global and international income categories. Table #1: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I extracted all mutual funds and exchanged traded funds using the MFO Premium Fund Screener and Lipper global dataset. What Table #2 tells us is that global high-yield and short high-yield categories don’t have as many funds or assets under management, and investors should invest with caution. Loan participation funds are interesting because they have a lower percentage of assets rated below investment grade, a small effective duration, and a high yield. High-yield categories have the highest 30d yields and the lowest-rated quality assets. Core plus bond funds have a longer duration and have performed poorly with rising rates. Table #2: Metrics for Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 is based on the history of nearly 400 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The top four categories have current yields of about 6% or more, full cycle returns of 4% to 7%, and drawdowns during severe market downturns of 13% to 20%. If investing in these categories go in with eyes wide open. By comparison, during the Dotcom Full Cycle from September 2000 to October 2007, the S&P 500 had an annualized return of around 2.0% The bottom four categories have lower yields and lower risk. Core plus bond funds performed relatively well during the financial crisis. I have invested in multi-sector funds as a middle-of-the-road option. Table #3: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I selected one fund, most interesting to me as a moderately conservative investor, from each of the eight Lipper Categories covered in the article. Table #4 is packed with useful information about risk (MFO Risk, MaxDD %, Bear Markets), risk-adjusted return (MFO Rating), returns (APR, Full Cycle), trends (Fund Flow, EMA), quality (Quality, Junk), and expenses (ER, FMR), and yield. Last month, I bought Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a lower-risk fund with a 30d yield of 6.0% and Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL) with a 30d yield of 7.2% but a little more risk. I bought Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) with a 30d yield of 5.2%. It has about 21% in equity and is higher risk and higher potential reward. The funds are loosely sorted with the safest to the left and riskier to the right in Table #4. For a future article, I have screened high-yielding funds rated with an MFO Risk of “Very Conservative” and Great Owl First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), and Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (AAA) are among the fourteen on the list.

The steady profile and low volatility can be observed in Figure #2 below for First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA), and to a lesser extent Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL). As longer-term yields start to stabilize, I expect JPMorgan Income ETF (JPIE), Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX), and American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP) to start to perform better. Note that some of these funds have averaged a respectable return of 7% to 13% over the past two years. Figure #2: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Loan Participation Funds: Funds that invest primarily in participation interests in collateralized senior corporate loans that have floating or variable rates. Loan participation funds are a diverse group that can make returns of 5% to 8% during rising or falling rates. They can have positive returns during a mild recession, but some may lose 20% or much more during a severe financial crisis. Percent Junk Plus Not Rated is a fairly good indicator of performance during a severe downturn in bond prices as shown in Figure #3. For this reason, I bought more of Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) than I did of Franklin Senior Loan ETF (FLBL). Figure #3: 2022 Returns Versus Percent Junk Plus Not Rated Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Most of the loan participation funds that I selected for Table #5 have lower risk and volatility; however, BlackRock Floating Rate Income Portfolio (BFRAX) had a drawdown of 19.6% during the financial crisis compared to Fidelity Floating Rate High Income (FFRHX) which had a drawdown of 8.4%. Table #5: High Performing Loan Participations Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) is one of my favorites because of its low drawdown and volatility which can be observed in Figure #4. It invests in higher-quality assets. Figure #4: High Performing Loan Participations Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Short high-yield funds have a lower risk compared to most other categories in this article with decent returns compared to other short-term bond funds. I bought Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) because it has a lower percentage of “Junk” rated bonds and a lower drawdown. Of the ETFs, I favor Xtrackers Short Duration High Yield Bond ETF (SHYL). Table #6: High Performing Short High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I focus on performance over the last year or two because the Federal Reserve has stopped raising rates, but check how the fund performed during the latest downturn. While Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) has underperformed recently, it had a lower drawdown during the COVID recession. Figure #5: High Performing Short High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Global High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from both domestic and foreign fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. The global high-yield category does not have many quality funds, but I identify Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) and AB Short Duration High Yield ETF (SYFI) as high performers with respectable yields, but moderately large drawdowns. Table #7: High Performing Global High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Of the two funds, I favor Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) for its risk-adjusted performance. Figure #6: High Performing Global High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Of the ETFs, I like iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (SHYG) and expect it to perform better during falling rates or a market downturn with less volatility. I bought modest amounts of Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) and Fidelity High Income (SPHIX) for diversification within the high-yield category. Table #8: High Performing High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #7 shows the diverse range of performance of high-yield funds due in part to hedging, duration, percent junk, and owning equity. Figure #7: High Performing High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years. Columbia Threadneedle Investments wrote As Interest Rates Rise, Investors May Look To Floating-Rate Funds explaining that while floating-rate bonds do well when rates are stable or rising, they tend to underperform when rates are falling. I favor Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF (FLDR) for its high yield and low volatility. Table #9: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #8: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Multi-Sector Income: Funds that seek current income by allocating assets among several different fixed-income securities sectors (with no more than 65% in any one sector except for defensive purposes), including U.S. government and foreign governments, with a significant portion of assets in securities rated below investment-grade. Exchange-traded funds are relatively new to the Multi-Sector Income category and of the two, I prefer JP Morgan Income ETF (JPIE). I purchased modest amounts of both the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond (VMSAX) and Fidelity Strategic Income (FADMX) for Traditional IRAs. Table #10: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #9: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of one to five years. I favor Great Owl First Trust Short Maturity ETF (FTSM) for its low volatility and drawdown. I own Fidelity Intermediate Bond (FTHRX) but traded a modest portion for other bond funds discussed in this article. Table #11: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #10: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Core Plus Bond Funds: Funds that invest at least 65% in domestic investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with any remaining investment in non-benchmark sectors such as high-yield, global, and emerging market debt. These funds maintain dollar-weighted average maturities of five to ten years. This is my least favorite category as its total return has been hampered as rates rose because of its longer duration, but I will continue to monitor it throughout the year. It is a category that I may want to own in the future as longer-term rates stabilize. The standout core plus bond fund is the Great Owl American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP). Table #12: High Performing Core Plus Bond Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #11 shows the one-year trends on core plus funds have been strong but the recent three-month trends are waving red flags. I will continue to monitor. Figure #11: High Performing Core Plus Bond Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. To prepare for 2025, I invested in high-yielding funds with low to moderate risk. These are the low-hanging fruit. There is plenty of opportunity to increase yields along with higher risk by investing in different funds within the same categories. It is possible to find funds with higher yields in other Lipper Categories. They usually have an Aggressive or Very Aggressive MFO Risk Rank, usually accompanied by below-average risk-adjusted performance as measured by MFO Rank, and often with very high expenses.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokens Lead Crypto Rebound as Tokenization Narrative Gathers Steam

Cryptocurrencies in the real-world asset (RWA) sector led the recovery of the broader digital asset market from the overnight bloodbath, underscoring the strength of the tokenization investment narrative. Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokenized asset platform Ondo Finance's governance token was 16% higher on the day, surging almost 40% from the overnight lows. The protocol today unveiled Ondo Nexus, an instant minting and redemption service for tokenized Treasury issuers. The company behind the protocol is holding a summit in New York later this week with several traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton participating. The native token of MANTRA (OM), layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized assets focusing on the Middle East market, rebounded 30% from Monday's bottom and was up 16% on the day. The network last month announced a billion-dollar asset tokenization partnership with Dubai property conglomerate DAMAC Group encompassing real estate and data center investments. The native token of Chintai (CHEX), a tokenization platform regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, advanced 27% during the same period. The protocol laid out plans late January to enter the U.S. market and pursue securities licensing in the country. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) rebounded above $101,000 from the overnight lows and was 4% higher in a 24-hour period. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index consisting of large-cap tokens lagged with a 2% gain. Sophisticated investors often analyze the fastest horses recovering from capitulation lows to identify underlying strength in the broader market. RWA tokenization is a red-hot sector that aims to bring traditional financial assets like bonds, commodities and real estate on blockchain rails. with increasing participation from global banks and governments fueling the momentum. The RWA sector saw a 200% expansion to $7.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) last year, with government securities protocols leading the growth, crypto trading firm Wintermute noted. Recently, various influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation with a potential to become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for tokenized securities, envisioning that bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future. He was joined by Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev last week, who proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized private equities to retail investors, currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals. UPDATE (Feb. 3, 21:10 UTC): Adds RWA sector expansion data from Wintermute. Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

Title: From JPMorgan to BlackRock: The 15 financial firms that file the most H-1B immigrant work visas
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-companies-sponsor-h1b-visas-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-blackrock-trump-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-02-03T19:53:26Z
Full Content:
As President Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promises to crack down on immigration, questions remain about what might happen to skilled workers who come to the US on H-1B visas. Trump targeted the H-1B visa program in his first term when he signed the "Buy American, Hire American" executive order to rein in potential abuses. Ahead of the second term, however, he told the New York Post that he "always liked the visas," which US companies use to hire foreign workers with specialized skills, often in science and technology. "I've been a believer in H-1B," he told the Post in December. "I have used it many times. It's a great program." Still, the program's future remains very much up in the air: Last week, two Republican senators introduced a joint resolution to strike down a Biden-era rule allowing such visas to be automatically extended for 540 days, instead of 180 days. As such, Business Insider has run the numbers to find out which US financial services companies stand to be affected the most if these visas are tamped down again. BI used data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration data to analyze which financial giants file the most H-1B requests. The data covered the 2024 government fiscal year (the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024) and was collected from applications submitted by businesses that wish to sponsor a skilled worker's visa. We found that some of the largest banks, credit card companies, and asset managers are among the most active sponsors of these visas, including JPMorgan and BlackRock. While many of the filings seek tech and software workers, some firms have used them to hire investment bankers or investment professionals. Of course, not all filings lead to a hire and some filings may actually be for the same hire, as firms will refile to reflect amendments or to extend an existing visa. Still, the publicly available data provides a good indication of the H-1B visa demand among major companies. The firms listed either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record. Check out which financial firms are sponsoring the most H-1B visas, including the types of roles they are looking to fill: Total certified H-1B filings: 1,990 Total employees worldwide: 317,233 as of the end of 2024 Types of filings: More than 1,500 filings are for workers with "software" in their title. The firm also hired for roles like a vice president of investment banking, an executive director of liquidity risk management, and a managing director of client fraud prevention.

The company has also hired some divisional COO and CFOs through the program, as well as managing directors in areas like banking and financial crime control. Total certified H-1B filings: 1,058 Total employees worldwide: 239,000 Types of filings: Many of the filings are for tech roles, such as software engineering, application development, and information technology roles.

The filings range from the associate level up to managing director. Total certified H-1B filings: 609 Total employees worldwide: Approximately 85,000, per its corporate website Types of filings: Most of Barclay's filings are for tech roles, but the company has also hired for director roles in global markets, equity derivatives structuring, and a credit desk quant role. Total certified H-1B filings: 587 Total employees worldwide: 31,600, according to a December 4 report Types of filings: The vast majority of filings are for tech roles, including a senior machine learning engineer and a variety of software engineers. Other filings include a senior M&A manager and a senior finance manager. Total certified H-1B filings: 575 Total employees worldwide: 74,000, per a 2024 press release Types of filings: Nearly a third of AmEx's filings are for manager roles, and the vast majority of those are in the tech and data science sectors of the business. The company has also filed for director roles in investment management and marketing analytics. Total certified H-1B filings: 500 Total employees worldwide: 213,193, as of the end of 2024 Types of filings: Similar to others on the list, most of Bank of America's H-1B filings are for tech roles, but the company has also hired a credit senior officer in a director role, an associate general counsel, and a VP who works with financial derivatives. Total certified H-1B filings: 453 Total employees worldwide: 220,167, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filings: Nearly 300 of Wells Fargo's filings are for roles with software in the title, but the firm had also filed for roles including a construction management director and a lead securities trader. Total certified H-1B filings: 447 Total employees worldwide: 33,400 employees at the end of 2023, per an annual report Types of filings: Mastercard has made 220 H-1B filings for roles with software in the title, while another 64 include the word "product" in the name.

Total certified H-1B filings: 429 Total employees worldwide: 32,100, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filing: More than 80% of roles have software in the name, though the company has also filed for director roles in business strategy, market risk management, and treasury capital markets.

The move reduces fees on 87 different funds, and 168 total share classes of those funds. The average fee cut is 20% per share class. Vanguard said this is its biggest fee cut ever and will save investors about $350 million this year, based on current asset levels. "We're proud to build on Vanguard's legacy of lowering the costs of investing—which we have done more than 2,000 times since our founding—by announcing our largest ever set of expense ratio reductions. Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time," Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji said in a press release. The list of cuts includes actively managed and index-based products, with many of the funds representing billions of dollars. Stocks, bonds and commodities products are all included in the reductions. Some of the funds on the Vanguard list include: Fund fees for mutual funds and ETFs are assessed as an annual percentage of total assets under management for the share class. The fee cuts to VEGBX and some other actively managed bond funds is notable because active fixed income is emerging as a growth area for the exchange-traded fund industry. The booming popularity of ETFs, which can be purchased more easily than many mutual funds, is often cited as a key factor in driving down management fees for stock funds in recent decades. Vanguard said its actively managed fixed income funds and ETFs have a weighted average expense ratio of 0.10% versus an industry average of 0.53%. Vanguard has long been a leader in lowering fees among asset managers, a tradition dating back to its founder, Jack Bogle. Monday's announcement is a sign that the trend could continue under Ramji, who took over as CEO in 2024 and previously worked at rival BlackRock.

Title: Why more retirement-age Americans keep working

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time When it came time for Diane Wetherington to consider retirement, reality quickly set in. The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers’ due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn’t be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. “It’s just getting very hard to make ends meet,” Wetherington said. “The way the world is right now, everything’s going up, up, up.” Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It’s also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the “Peak 65 zone.” The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. “It’s really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now,” said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group “can help build key capacity where it’s desperately needed.” While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America’s population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program’s “full retirement age” from 65 to 67. “People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits,” Quinby said. “That shift triggered a trend in people working longer.” Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it’s “a bit crazy” that the expectation of retiring at 65 “originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.” Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School’s Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it “because they have to.” They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can’t sustain them. “I call it the tale of two retirements,” Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. “The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy,” said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra’s human resources chief. “They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience.” Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. “They’re like vintage cars to us,” said FedCap’s Malatras. “They’re built to last, they’re full of value, but they’re treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don’t really have an opportunity to serve anymore.” Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren’t any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP’s pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix’s argument for employers is the impending “tsunami” of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don’t tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they’ll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn’t all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there’s a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra’s sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. “People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams,” Tinsley-Fix said. “They really benefit from having those folks.” Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they’ve benefited physically and mentally. “It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson’s role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That’s where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn’t for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a “shock” after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. “I don’t enjoy not having things I have to do,” Sallee said. “I never envisioned the ‘sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail’ kind of lifestyle.” Still, Sallee said she’s taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. “If that ever becomes a problem,” she said of her yearly stretch of time off, “the vacation will take priority.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Texas Stock Exchange Raises $161 Million, Sees 2026 Trading Start

TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said the TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. If the registration is granted, trading would start in early 2026, the company said in a statement Friday. It had previously said trading would begin by the end of this year. The exchange – whose backers include BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities – is still targeting its first listings for next year. The upstart TXSE is seeking to join a handful of smaller bourses that are trying to bite off market share from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which dominate US public-equity trading. The challengers are battling for a piece of a shrinking pie: Listings have declined precipitously since the 1990s as the rise of private equity has made it easier for companies to avoid the costs of going public for longer. Additionally, the majority of US stock trades is now consistently occurring outside of public exchanges. The proposed Texas bourse says it wants to lower the cost of going public while “revitalizing competition for listings and enhancing trading in the US capital markets,” TXSE Chief Executive Officer James Lee said in the statement. The company was able to boost its capital raise by about $40 million since it disclosed in June that it had brought in $120 million. Other investors include Charles Schwab Corp. and Michael Dell’s family investment office. In addition to equities, the Dallas-based bourse plans to host auctions and sell exchange-traded products and data. It’s still looking for a space to house its permanent headquarters, which will contain offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell. Topics Texas

Title: Betrayed by Green Capitalism, Here’s How We Can Build a Livable Future

Time Published: 2025-02-03T16:00:00Z

In one way of measuring it, the mainstream framework to address the climate crisis has been a huge success. Promoting green energy, electric vehicles, conservation zones, carbon credits, carbon capture, and other new technologies has made billions of dollars for companies like Tesla, Google, NextEra Energy, British Petroleum, Saudi Aramco, Tongwei Solar, McKinsey & Company, and BlackRock. Governments have gained power through increased interventions in economic planning, and authoritarian regimes from China and India to Canada and the U.S. now have a new justification to carry out land theft against Indigenous and rural populations. And millions more NGO directors, aid workers, diplomats, accountants, entrepreneurs, engineers, academics, and scientists get a hand-out in the form of high salary employment managing the crisis. Where the mainstream climate framework has been less successful: Doing anything to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving the climate crisis. Nor has the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledged the reasons for this failure or presented a plan based in reality. Here are some truths the mainstream climate framework downplays, ignores, or covers up: There are tremendous short-term benefits to legitimizing the failed climate framework: jobs, money, attention, power, the comforting belief that those in charge are going to keep us safe. Likewise, there are immense obstacles to developing realistic alternatives: Lack of rewards, marginalization and silencing, state and corporate repression. The result is a sort of self-reinforcing confirmation bias. People aren’t exposed to the gaping holes in the official framework or to examples of the kind of changes we actually need, alternatives remain easy to marginalize as ​“fringe,” and the failed framework maintains its fatal monopoly. Our survival depends on escaping the dead-end cataclysm of the official response. But, we can’t enact solutions we’re unable to imagine — so let’s start imagining a real solution. It won’t be an easy exercise: We’ll have to jettison the entire institutional complex that has caused and is managing the problem. We’ll also have to envision change occurring through a completely different paradigm than the one we’re brought up believing in. There isn’t really an alternative, since the official framework doesn’t constitute a viable plan. And everything we do toward an ecological revolution makes our own lives better, makes our own ecosystem more resilient, and increases everyone’s chances for collective survival. (Editor’s Note: For more discussion of the research and reasoning behind these arguments, read the companion piece here.) A paradigm and a practice that could successfully confront the ecological crisis is one based on what I would call rooted networks. Rooted networks are ecosystemic and interdependent. They allow for everyone to define their own needs, to build their own relationships with their specific habitat, and to share resources and feedback throughout their habitat and across the entire system. The basic operating principles of rooted networks are: This paradigm allows each of us to maximize our potential for action and our unique knowledge, and to amplify both through relationships of mutual aid. Rather than small groups of experts and owners imposing blueprints on a disempowered society and muted landscape, we would all increase our connectivity to our neighbors and the land, understand their needs and their history, and build from there. Can you already hear that voice in your head braying out that such an approach is naïve? It’s strange how that’s the orthodox position in our politics. In the fields of urban science and computer science, AI or machine learning, neuroscience, encyclopedias, comparative cognition, the study of mycelial networks and ecosystems and other complex systems, the social organization of insects with large population groups, the data is practically endless: Decentralized networks have a high capacity for communication, learning, and innovation; they often have a sophisticated capacity for self-organization; and they tend to be more resilient in adverse circumstances where centralized, hierarchical systems are likely to catastrophically collapse. There are also countless examples of decentralized, complex, resilient societies throughout human history, continuing into the present. These include the hundreds of interlaced peoples of Zomia—the southeast Asian highlands— who are surrounded but still unconquered by some of the strongest and longest lasting states in history; the Amazigh of northern Africa; the Mayan peoples of the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; the Mapuche of the Andes and the Pacific coast; the four hundred Indigenous peoples of the Amazon. These are societies who have defeated empires and colonizers, who have survived and adapted to earlier collapses, or who overthrew their own ruling classes. They are peoples who find abundance and safety in ecosystems where states only see desert, who have cultivated the richest rain forests on the planet, and who even in the 20th and 21st centuries have launched major rebellions against oppression. Their traditional social structures provide them with decentralized networks and federations that are a major source of their resilience. An important strategy of colonialism has been to erase these histories and destroy or marginalize these cultures so we have to depend on those in power, believing hierarchies to be natural, believing states to be inevitable. But the truth of the matter is that decentralized networks are practical, they’re intelligent, and they work. The first few years after an ecological revolution will be hard, despite the intelligence and resilience of rooted networks, though many benefits will appear immediately. And we’ll avoid the worst of the suffering that lies ahead should we stick with the mainstream climate framework. The top priorities are food, housing, and healthcare for everybody. Capitalist property laws, car- and airplane-based transportation systems, industrial mono-cropping, and borders are threats to our health, so we abolish, destroy, or transform them. Climate refugees and unhoused people seize mansions and vacation homes, and the rest of us support them because universal housing is more important than the property titles of the rich. With climate disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, everyone’s homes are at risk, so empathy comes easier to most of us. We distribute all the food we find in supermarkets and warehouses, then turn lawns, golf courses, parking lots, and highways into orchards, gardens, forests, meadows, and wetlands. As we transition away from industrial mono-cropping, we gain some breathing room by harvesting fields that are already planted, planting the next seasons’ seed stores, and eating the livestock bred to satisfy the machinery of capitalist meat production. Without money, wages are no longer an incentive. The acceptance and goodwill of one’s neighbors isn’t just a mental health benefit: It becomes the basis for our survival, motivating us to learn cooperative practices. Workers in high pollution industries — once the bosses have no more power and there’s no rent to pay — will decide to protect their own water supplies, their own neighbors and families. They’ll cap oil and gas wells and phase out nuclear power plants on the safest timeline. The communities that inhabit affected watersheds will decide whether and how to dismantle hydroelectric dams. Fossil fuel emissions will begin declining immediately, reaching zero within a few years. As energy supplies diminish, priority will be given to healthcare facilities, food production facilities, factories that produce necessary tools and resources, and for seasonal heating or cooling in regions with extreme temperatures. Medical research will continue around the world, with the material support of regional community networks rather than the pharmaceutical industry. Those historically abused or silenced by the medical industry will be able to assert their own experiences, knowledge, and needs. Together, we will generate an informed prediction of the most frequent health problems that are likely to affect us over the coming years despite improved diets, healthier lifestyles, and drastic reductions in environmental toxins. This will help determine which high-tech production facilities for drugs and equipment are still necessary, and what resources they need to continue operation. Global networks will carry out similar assessments in other vital sectors like housing, travel, transport, communication, and food. Communities across the world will scrap and recycle unnecessary machinery and capitalism’s abundant trash, shut down or repurpose the factories, and build towards the material autonomy of every regional network of communities. The general organizational principles are these: Especially in the first few years of the revolution, one of the key activities is to shift resources globally to undo the forced dependence and vulnerability caused by colonialism. No country should ever have been turned into a plantation or mining pit for global capitalism, and no revolution will be complete if it forgets about the legacies of colonialism. Using cargo ships, airplanes, and remaining fuel reserves, a global network of former shipping industry workers, revolutionaries, community organizers, and engineers transport whatever is required for historically colonized regions to attain regional self-sufficiency, producing the tools they need for whatever technological culture they choose, so long as it does not damage the health and freedom of others. After about twelve years of major upheavals, life has settled into a much more comforting pattern. Communities source the vast majority of their food locally. Coastal communities might travel farther for food, when fishing, but they’re using sustainable, ancestral techniques: no trawling, drift nets, purse-seine nets, or dynamite. Food self-sufficiency means that if anything impedes the movement of food across a continent, the situation is uncomfortable for a season or two, but no one’s survival is threatened. And, if some disaster wreaks havoc on a community’s fields, herds, or orchards, they can use the relationships and infrastructure linking them to other communities to get their food from elsewhere. Nearly all the fruit and nut trees we planted in the early years are providing us with abundant harvests for a small amount of labor every year. The trees provide habitat and nourishment for other species in our ecosystem. The yearly piles of pruned branches provide an additional carbon-neutral fuel source. Together with companion planting and ecological grazing, we’re regenerating the soil and nourishing ourselves with the healthiest diets possible. In the first years, every community identified the least polluted land in their area for planting orchards, gardens, and pastures. Moderately polluted lands are reforested and the trees harvested there are used as building material. The most polluted lands can be slowly recovered with bioremediation and other techniques. Every community tends to wetlands, estuaries, meadows, and forests along its margins. In these spaces, we hunt species like deer that rely on us for a healthy rate of predation. We practice regenerative grazing with goats, sheep, chickens, cows, and llamas, reducing the intensity of wildfires and re-fertilizing soil. We collect medicinal herbs and harvest building materials like clay or wood, always in a respectful way, attentive to our impact, focused on helping our ecosystems grow stronger. On abandoned urban blocks, people tend to the jungles sprouting from the empty structures. Fungal networks, trees, insects, and hardy grasses are breaking down the concrete or asphalt covering the earth, slowly remediating the toxins, and turning a wasteland into a vibrant habitat. Housing patterns shift considerably. Most people prefer to adapt and repurpose what is in front of them, though thousands of idealistic, innovative communes also spring up on depleted agricultural land or in abandoned strip malls. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants generally shrink by about half in the first dozen years, whereas rural populations double or triple. A huge amount of work has to go into scrapping or renovating the wretched housing stock left over from capitalism. The new standard is for structures to last a hundred years or more without major repairs, to use techniques like passive solar and good air circulation for self-heating and self-cooling, and to have efficient, small-scale energy production built into the very design of our towns and neighborhoods. In cities, the best housing blocks are taken over and improved, while other blocks are used for workshops, factories, storage, or knocked down and gradually converted into habitat and, if the soil allows, gardens and orchards. In the countryside, people reform existing large structures or build new ones to create multiple houses, workshops, barns, and storage places clustered together. These clusters share walls and heat. They facilitate communal cooking on a larger scale and simplify the logistics for things like clean water, water remediation, composting, methane harvesting from compost and livestock, and efficient electricity generation. Ultimately, the divide between urban and rural has eroded, as nearly a quarter of the world’s population moves seasonally between rural villages and city neighborhoods, according to weather or labor-intensive agricultural activities like a harvest. Most villages and urban neighborhoods exist in pairs, with a declared bond and a circulation of inhabitants between a specific city block and a village that might be 50-100 miles away. People moving between the sites a couple times a year gain perspective and experience, and their mixed loyalties facilitate mutual aid and prevent the historical domination of urban centers over agricultural zones. Nomadic peoples, from Travellers to Bedouin, have made a huge comeback, aided by the abolition of borders and nation-states. So too have some of the major biomes worst impacted by capitalism. The commercial ​“forests” that took up land, depleted soil, and fueled wildfires from Canada to Chile have been transformed into real forests again, complex ecosystems that give life to thousands of species and provide a range of renewable resources to human communities. Likewise, the Great Plains and similar ecosystems from Siberia to the Serengeti are freed from the depravities of a capitalist market, whether in the form of industrial-scale beef and dairy production, gas and oil extraction or colonial conservationism and eco-tourism. On the Great Plains, for example, once dominant cattle ranchers, with no more industrial market to sell to and few protections against poachers and fence cutters, have either turned to smaller scale, intensive grazing practices that helped restore the prairies, or they moved out. Indigenous peoples and trusted friends and accomplices they invited along recovered most of their lands and are helping restore them by dismantling dams and pipelines and adapting traditional technologies, food cultures, and spirituality. Desertification has slowed significantly, and by the end of the century it’s predicted there will be at least four million wild bison, roaming free again. The abolition of borders and the recovery of large biomes have made a critical difference in one adaptive response that everyone should have access to for survival: migration. Humans living in regions that mining companies have turned into wastelands or that militaries have filled with depleted uranium need support as they leave their homes behind. And whoever migrates needs a warm welcome, some place to put down roots again. Ecosystems also migrate, and some species and habitats have to migrate rapidly away from the tropics or to higher elevations. A revolutionary response to the ecological crisis does much to mitigate the harm and turbulence, but the climate is already changing thanks to the last two hundred years of capitalist greed. Borders, highways, and the biodiversity deserts of asphalted cities, the lawns and parking lots of suburbia, were all huge impediments to migration. Now, attentive, ecologically-minded human communities aid migration — the migration of fellow humans, of other species, and of entire ecosystems. With universal healthcare and housing, an immediate decrease of toxins in our air, water, and food, and the recovery of Indigenous or locally-adapted food cultures, our health and happiness improve dramatically. Social decentralization and the abolition of borders allow us much greater resilience to the disasters caused by capitalism. With the end of fossil fuel production, commercial forestry, cement production, and capitalist food production, greenhouse gas emissions flip from the catastrophic levels permitted by the mainstream climate framework and move into negative numbers. Within about a decade, hundreds of millions of new trees and soil recovery across all the billions of acres of agricultural land on the planet has absorbed significant quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere. Energy production has hit net zero, with the shift towards clean-burning biofuels, mostly passive wind and solar, and maintenance of about half of the pre-existing hydroelectric infrastructure. Catastrophic floods and wildfires which release huge amounts of methane and carbon — and are usually left off the emissions balance sheets — decline sharply or are eliminated. And without states, the frequency and intensity of warfare, and its massive and uncounted carbon emissions, diminishes drastically. Coming back to the depressing reality of 2025: the IPCC is pushing for the global economy to reach net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. They also have a perfect track record of failure and no realistic methodology for reaching their target. The approach I’m describing here can effectively do better than net zero. It even has the possibility to quickly remove enough CO2 and methane from the atmosphere to stop the cascade of tipping points that capitalism has already begun to trigger, a cascade that would lock in 3-5ºC of warming and cause death, extinction, and suffering on an unprecedented scale. This approach benefits from being complex and intersectional. It improves quality of life, universalizes access to quality healthcare and housing, and takes major steps to heal the enduring legacies of white supremacy and colonialism. The mainstream approach, on the contrary, exacerbates many preexisting inequalities and rewards the corporations and institutions responsible for the disaster. No matter when we adopt a realistic response to the ecological crisis, it will be better for our own lives, for future generations, and for all life on this planet. It removes the filters that prevent us from seeing the problem. It empowers us to take action for our shared survival. And it gives us greater resilience to adapt and overcome.

I believe the Anglo-American-Zionist Empire has lost the quarter-century-long World War III that began with 9/11, i.e., the Neocons’ “New Pearl Harbor.” The U.S is now beginning its own solitary “long retreat” to “Fortress America.” Future wars are likely to be peripheral skirmishes. The U.S. can’t even get along with Canada and Mexico, is under siege by criminal gangs, and China is buying up Latin America. Even the Monroe Doctrine is barely breathing any more. In Europe, Ukraine has lost the war which the Neocons started, NATO is “the night of the living dead,” and Russia will integrate economically with Germany. The people of Europe are too smart and too scared to go down with the ship. Britain is in the midst of full-scale collapse. 500-years of British occult empire is done—stick a fork in it. The Black Nobility that heads the globalist financial elite—The “City,” the WEF, Bilderberg, the WHO, the “Woke,” etc.—is also seeing its world collapse. The parasite has been killing the host, and the host is in full rebellion. No more genocidal “jabs” for us, thank you. In the U.S., Trump’s main economic goal is to keep the stock market soaring so his donors can continue to ride the IT wave, which is the only U.S. asset class remaining other than farmland saturated with chemicals. The poor and middle class will continue to drown in the waves. BRICS will win any trade wars the U.S. starts. The great U.S. trade market is built on debt and is going under. Gurgle, gurgle, BlackRock. Israel and the Israel lobby will continue to be the albatross around Trump’s neck, so the Palestinian two-state solution has to re-emerge. Trump knows, or should know, that with a big Middle East war all bets are off. He may do it anyway. No one can say one more really big smack in the face is not coming. My advice to individuals in the Western world: look to your own survival, along with those of family and friends. Believe me, in today’s world survival is enough.

Title: ‘A Tidal Wave Of Fear’—Trump Tariffs Fuel Price Crash Fears For Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP And Crypto

This post was originally published on February 2 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stalled after soaring higher following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory—with fears suddenly emerging the $4 trillion crypto bubble could be about to pop. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told banks they are permitted to offer bitcoin and ... [+] crypto to clients as fears emerge the bitcoin price could be on the verge of a crash. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, topping $100,000 per bitcoin and driving ... [+] the crypto market to around $4 trillion as Donald Trump bets on bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Bessent Takes the Helm on US Debt Sales After Blasting Yellen

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- After repeatedly blasting Janet Yellen last year over her department’s strategy for issuing federal debt, it’s now up to Scott Bessent to make the call on sales of Treasuries, with bond dealers conflicted over what he’ll do in a pivotal release due Wednesday. Most Read from Bloomberg New York’s First ‘Passive House’ School Is a Model of Downtown Density When French Communists Went on a Brutalist Building Boom Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push In the past four straight so-called quarterly refunding plans, the Treasury has advised that it didn’t expect to increase issuance of longer-dated securities “for at least the next several quarters,” after a final bump up at the start of last year. Many dealers see that changing, in part because of past comments from Bessent, potentially watering it down to “a few” or “a couple” of quarters. The former hedge fund manager, before he was picked by President Donald Trump as Yellen’s successor, was one of a number of Republicans who charged Yellen with having artificially held down sales of longer-maturity Treasuries — which affect things like mortgage rates — to boost the pre-election economy. He also in August criticized the advance notice in the refunding statement as “the first time ever” the Treasury had offered forward guidance. “This is going to be the key point of the statement on Wednesday,” said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Corp. “I can’t help but think it’s a new administration, they want to have their own guidance.” Should Bessent, who has yet to build out his team at the Treasury after being sworn in to the job just last Tuesday, remove the guidance entirely, dealers cautioned longer-term Treasuries may drop in anticipation of increased supply. Several still see the previous language being retained for now, although a number of them viewed it as a close call. One challenge is that longer-term Treasury yields have jumped the better part of a percentage point since September — in part due to concerns about fiscal deficits and inflation in light of Trump’s plans for more tax cuts and tariff hikes. With higher levies set to kick in across-the-board on Canada, Mexico and China starting Tuesday, the refunding this week takes place at a time of particular uncertainty about the rates outlook. As of late Friday, 10-year notes yielded well over 20 basis points more than bills, which mature in up to a year, making them more costly to the Treasury, and raising the stakes for any move to boost longer-dated sales. “It’s a very different world now than back in 2023, when Yellen decided to lean more on bills,” said Jason Williams, a strategist at Citigroup Inc. “Bill yields back then were higher than those on coupon-bearing debt, but that’s not the case now and the absolute level of yields is also higher. Even if Bessent does want to extend the weighted average maturity of US debt, he’d want to do it in a slow and orderly fashion.” After a string of increases beginning in August 2023, the Treasury has kept its quarterly refunding auctions, which span 3-, 10- and 30-year maturities, at $125 billion. Even relatively modest shifts in size can have a market impact. Yields climbed after the August 2023 boost, and they dropped in the wake of a November 2023 move to temper the ramping up of issuance of longer-dated debt. Given outsize US fiscal deficits, the amount of debt the Treasury has to sell over time continues to climb, and dealers say increased sales of longer maturities is inevitable at some point. The Treasury on Monday is set to release an update on broader borrowing needs and cash-balance estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Santander and Societe Generale are among firms that expect Bessent to leave his predecessor’s guidance intact for now. Still, the consensus among dealers is that long-term debt issuance doesn’t actually move higher until the November refunding, with some seeing potential for a bump as soon as August. Cabana at Bank of America thinks it’s possible the guidance will disappear completely — something that could lead some investors to see an increase in sales as soon as the May refunding. BofA’s Katie Craig, along with Cabana, wrote in a note to clients last week to expect Bessent to ask the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of bond market participants, to undertake a study of investor demand for a potential boost in long-term debt sales. The Fed The politics of the issue came to the fore in mid-2024, with a paper by economists Stephen Miran — whom Trump has nominated to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers — and Nouriel Roubini accusing Yellen’s Treasury of manipulating the issuance of Treasuries. Yellen firmly rejected that idea, and one of her top lieutenants delivered a detailed speech to counter “misconceptions.” Meantime, there are other considerations, including uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will halt its steady reduction in holdings of Treasuries — currently running at up to $25 billion a month. While Chair Jerome Powell last week offered no hint on when that might end, when it is phased out, that will reduce the amounts the Treasury needs to borrow from the public. The Treasury specifically asked dealers in a quarterly survey this month for their views on Fed balance-sheet policy changes ahead. Along with a high degree of uncertainty about the fiscal outlook, “these are the two main factors that make the decision-making process a little bit more complicated moving forward, which on its own argues for maybe being a little bit less committal” in Wednesday’s statement, said William Marshall, Goldman’s head of US rates strategy. “There’s a cost to giving guidance and then not following through.” Keeping the status quo for issuance sizes would put next week’s refunding auctions on course for the following: $58 billion of 3-year notes on Feb. 11 $42 billion of 10-year notes on Feb. 12 $25 billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 13 The Treasury on Wednesday is also seen keeping issuance of floating-rate debt unchanged, while continuing to nudge sales of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, higher. Yet another complication for Bessent is managing the world’s biggest bond market under the constraints of the federal debt limit, which kicked back in at the start of January. Any drawn-out episode in Congress over raising or suspending the limit will force the Treasury to slash bill issuance and spend down its cash buffer. “Once Bessent is kind of settled and we are through the debt-limit issue, then maybe they start poking around at longer-term issuance,” said Blake Gwinn at RBC Capital Markets. “So this meeting could be kind of a wash.” Unless the Trump administration is able to rein in the deficit, now seen running at an historically high 6% or more of GDP for years to come, bigger auction sizes are looming — with consequences for yields, according to Marc Seidner, chief investment officer of non-traditional strategies at Pacific Investment Management Co. “That suggests to us that there should be a greater risk premium, a greater term premium in long-term debt and a steeper yield curve.” Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, sees 10-year yields headed back to 5% or above, from around 4.5% currently. While there’s high uncertainty around the administration’s specific plans, “tax cuts and other things will definitely continue the deficit’s trajectory.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America’s Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The London-based startup, which helps businesses collect recurring payments such as subscriptions, reported a net loss of £35.1 million ($43.8 million) in the full year ending June 30, 2024. That was a 55% improvement from the £78 million GoCardless lost the year prior. The firm noted that "restructuring activity" at the end of the full year ending June 2023 contributed to a reduction in operating losses in 2024. In June 2023, GoCardless announced it was cutting 15% of its global workforce. That took GoCardless' salary expenses down 13% to £79.2 million in the company's 2024 fiscal year. Still, while this improved the company's financial picture, GoCardless' CEO Hiroki Takeuchi told CNBC that revenue growth also helped significantly. "We're much more focused on the cost side ... We want to be getting very efficient as we scale," Takeuchi said in an interview last week. "But we also need to continue growing. We need both of those things to get to where we want to be." GoCardless grew revenue by 41% to £132 million in full-year 2024. Of that total, £91.9 million came from customer revenue. Last year also saw GoCardless record its first-ever month in profit in March 2024. Takeuchi said its his aim for GoCardless to post its first full-year profit in 12 to 18 months' time, adding it's "well on track" to do so. Back in September, GoCardless acquired a firm called Nuapay, which helps businesses collect and send payments via bank transfer. Asked whether GoCardless is considering further mergers and acquisitions in future, Takeuchi said the firm is "actively looking," adding: "We're seeing lots of opportunities come up." Following its acquisition of Nuapay, Takeuchi said GoCardless is currently testing a new feature that allows clients to distribute funds to their own customers. "If you take something like energy, the vast majority of the payments are about collecting money," he told CNBC. "But then you might have some of your customers that have solar panels on their roof and they're sending energy back to the grid, and they need to get paid for that energy that they're generating." GoCardless, which is backed by Alphabet's venture arm GV, Accel and BlackRock, was last privately valued by investors at $2.1 billion in February 2022. Takeuchi said the firm had no need for external capital and that there are "no plans" for an initial public offering in the near term. Fintechs have been watching Swedish fintech Klarna's plan to go public closely — but many are waiting to see how it goes before deciding on their own plans. With technology IPOs at historic lows, several startups have instead opted to provide employees and early shareholders liquidity by selling shares in the secondary market. In November, Bloomberg reported that GoCardless had chosen investment bank Lazard to advise it on a $200 million secondary share sale. GoCardless declined to comment on the report.

Title: Blue zones, where people live to 100, are a lovely idea. It’s a shame they don’t exist
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/01/23/blue-zones-where-people-live-to-100-are-a-lovely-idea-its-a-shame-they-dont-exist/
Time Published: 2025-02-03T07:05:00Z
Full Content:
Blue zones are places where people reportedly live in good health to over 100 years of age. These locations seem to hold the secrets of exceptional longevity wrapped up in the warm glow of red wine with family. Blue zones are a lovely idea, but they likely don’t exist. In fact, the extreme age of people who live in these areas may be more due to poor record keeping than healthy lifestyle habits. Examples of blue zones include Okinawa in Japan, Loma Linda in California, Sardinia in Italy and Ikaria in Greece. These areas have been studied in detail to understand why their people live such long and healthy lives and, more importantly, what we can do to emulate their longevity successes. The common factors include daily activity, drinking red wine, prioritising family, eating vegetables, having faith in something, taking time off, and celebrating life. These are (mostly) all very sensible things most people could integrate into their lives. But while all the blue zones mentioned have these factors in spades, it doesn’t take long to realise that endless small towns around the world, particularly in the Mediterranean, share these traits, yet lack exceptional longevity. Why do these blue zones have populations that are routinely dying at over 100 years of age if it’s not down to the factors listed above? It’s worth looking more closely at these areas and the factors that unite them. Some other factors common to blue zones include poor birth and death registration, poverty, specifically old-age poverty, high crime rates, worse health metrics, and remote regions of birth. In some blue zones, rates of smoking are often as high as 50 per cent, and rates of illiteracy reach as high as 80 per cent. This is not exactly what you would expect from an area where people are supposed to have exceptionally long and healthy lives. As a centenarian or supercentenarian who has lived to over 110 years, you would have been born when the record-keeping of births and deaths was either not present or less robust. The number of supercentenarians plummeted after the rollout of mandatory birth registration and census keeping in the United States. This suggests that when formal record-keeping was mandated, self-estimations of age, which were common practice at the time, were no longer accepted. But the strange birth registration issues don’t end there. Supercentenarians born in the US are 1.5 times more likely to be born on the first day of the month. In Japan, that figure rises to 2.7 times. This, to put it mildly, seems a little odd. When countries attempt to count their true number of centenarians, they are frequently surprised to learn that many of them are already dead. A 2010 Japanese investigation discovered that almost a quarter of a million of their centenarian population was already deceased. A similar investigation in the US found that 35 per cent of all supercentenarians were already dead. Of all the supercentenarians in the US and France, not one has an authentic birth certificate. Record-keeping for those born in the early 1900s in areas of the world that have struggled with poverty has been subpar. In reality, blue zones may be more of an artefact of poor record keeping rather than lifestyle. But that doesn’t mean we should ignore the lifestyle patterns identified in blue zones. They probably won’t be the determining factor that gets you to 110 years of age; they are, however, a great place to start if you want to add ten years to your life and live to 90. Rather than focusing on blue zones, it is better to examine lifestyle factors in longer-term studies and see how they impact lifespan. When people get the basics right by age 50 – not smoking, maintaining a normal weight, being active daily, maintaining modest alcohol intake, and maintaining a good diet – they can extend their lives by over a decade. That is more than a 10 per cent life extension. This means that the average male who gets these factors in check by age 50 will die on average at 87, and the average female who gets them right will live on average to 93. Getting them right is unlikely to get you to 110, as the blue zones would suggest, but you’re likely to live significantly longer than those who don’t get them right. What is even more important is that getting these healthy factors right can delay the onset of many serious medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes, by 10 years. An additional 10 years without a major illness means the life years gained will be much higher quality. Adhering to these healthy patterns does not guarantee longevity, but it seriously increases the odds. If following a “blue zone” diet or way of life seems attractive to you, the data shows that it will likely extend your life by over a decade – just don’t plan on it extending your life to over 110 years of age. For that, you might need to work on your birth certificate forgery skills.

Title: Here’s the few foreign markets set to win on Trump’s return

Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the United States are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the US leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump “friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. “Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock Inc, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that “aligns itself politically to the US ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” Gramercy Fund Management, which was set up by veteran investor Robert Koenigsberger in 1998, echoed the view in its quarterly strategy outlook, saying the beginning of the new US administration should be characterised by a stronger emphasis on bilateral relations at the expense of multilateral ones. Bonds from countries including Argentina and El Salvador could enjoy “some market premium” at the start of the year thanks to their leaders having a good relationship with Trump, according to Gramercy. Turkey, India and Hungary could also benefit. Since Trump secured his return to the White House, dollar bonds of Argentina, Ecuador and El Salvador have handed investors gains of at least 11%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 2.3% return for a benchmark index of developing-nation credits. Fears that Trump’s economic measures might boost the dollar and fan inflation in the world’s largest economy, cutting the room the Federal Reserve has to lower interest rates, have muddied the waters for developing economies. A lack of clarity around Trump’s tariff plans, which could have devastating impacts in emerging nations, have also dimmed the outlook for the asset class, which has been grappling with back-to-back annual outflows. Asian economies fare worse than emerging peers, with high trade surpluses against the US and secondary effects from measures on Chinese trade that risk stifling the region’s growth. Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand are some of the most at-risk nations should Trump enact across the board tariffs, with exports to the US as a percent of GDP in the double digits, according to US government data compiled by Bloomberg. “Identifying Trump’s friends and enemies is very important. The obvious challenge with the US is for China and everything that follows on from that,” said Arnab Das, a global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management Ltd. in London. “The tariffs are going to be levelled at different countries for all kinds of transgressions and bad behavior.” As part of a larger strategy to avoid any confrontation with Trump, India is already considering options to narrow its trade surplus with the US, possibly through a trade deal, cutting tariffs or importing more goods from the US. The country is also prepared to work with the Trump administration to identify and take back all of its residents residing illegally in the US. Investors in Europe have the additional complication of disentangling Trump’s views on individual countries and their leaders from his general approach to the European Union. Hungary, whose leader Viktor Orban is frequently praised by Trump and other US conservatives for a governance style Orban has called “illiberal democracy,” is a prime example for traders. ‘Winning’ In Latin America, El Salvador, Argentina and Ecuador are expected to receive strong US support during Trump’s term, according to Ricardo Penfold, a managing director at Seaport Global. Argentina’s dollar bonds have been on a tear due to Milei’s harsh austerity plan, and his affinity with Trump — he was one of the few foreign leaders to attend the US President’s swearing in — may help the country skirt tariffs, avoiding additional pressure for its beleaguered currency, said Jeff Grills, head of US cross-asset and emerging-markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. El Salvador has already started taking in US military planes filled with deported migrants and is working with Trump to develop an asylum agreement. Daniel Noboa’s tough policies against transnational gangs and his support for foreign military bases in Ecuador — should he win the upcoming election — will also appeal to Trump, said Nathalie Marshik, a managing director at HSBC in New York. Whiplash Meantime, countries that Trump had gone after so far have seen their asset prices getting whiplashed. Traders soured on Colombia earlier this week after a migration dispute resulted in a brief, but unexpected tariff spat, sending the currency down as much as 2% in one day. Panama, whose leader rebuked Trump’s threat to reassert control of the Panama Canal, saw JPMorgan Chase & Co downgrade its recommendation on the country’s bonds. Markets should take the risk more seriously and there’s “little clarity on the endgame,” strategists including Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a note last week. In Mexico, investors are waiting to see if Trump will enact the planned 25% tariffs on the country’s goods on Saturday. The White House said on Friday that Trump intends to move ahead with the idea, denying a report that he planned on delaying the implementation by a month. Unlike Mexico, Turkey has a balanced relationship with the US as the $29 billion trade volume is almost equally split between exports and imports, according to the US government data for 2024. However, this did not spare the country in 2018, when Trump sanctioned senior Turkish officials and raised tariffs on some imports in response to the extended detention of an American citizen, sending local markets into turmoil. While a good relationship with the US might help, it’s no guarantee of outperformance. Local factors — from elections in Ecuador to an IMF deal in Argentina — are still key to sustain gains. “The lesson learned is that Trump is willing to push very aggressively to use sanctions and tariff threats to achieve his policy objectives,” said Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow. “There are a number of countries in the region that will end up capitulating.”

Title: Musk rips 'fraudulent' Treasury handouts as reports mount DOGE has access to federal payment system

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 5:12:37 PM PST by Libloather Tech billionaire Elon Musk ripped alleged "fraudulent" Treasury payments on Saturday as reports circulated that the Department of Government Efficiency has gained acces to the federal government's payment system as the second Trump administration continues cutting what they say is government fat and overspending. "The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once," Musk, the chair of DOGE, posted early Saturday morning to X. Musk's post came just ahead of the New York Times reporting Saturday afternoon that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel access to the payment system. The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

Posted on 02/02/2025 3:33:00 PM PST by governsleastgovernsbest On Sunday's edition of The Weekend on MSNBC, weeknight host Chris Hayes questioned Trump's machismo for imposing higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico than on China. He's tougher on allies than on adversaries, because that's easier, less risky. He even claimed Trump has been "extremely generous to adversaries" like Russia and China. HAYES: He likes the conflict, he likes to project strength, but he's sort of a coward fundamentally. And the stakes of actual conflict and fights with adversaries is much higher. And so this is a way of kind of, a little bit of bullying, and cake and eat it too, where he can, like, play tough against Justin Trudeau, which is a very different thing than playing tough against Xi. Co-host Symone Sanders analogized it to Trump's treatment of Gavin Newsom. While blasting Newsom in public, Trump, according to Sanders, is very polite to him in person. Sanders put on a soft voice, supposedly imitating Trump: "Hey, how are you doing? Good to see you."

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Krisztian Sandor Vlad Tenev joined BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in calling for clear regulations for tokenized securities in the U.S. Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind,” Tenev wrote. “It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to “rapidly approve” tokenization of stocks and bonds.

Title: BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Records 5250 BTC Inflows, Will The Rally Sustain?

BlackRock spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF saw massive inflows following the broader market rebound. Bitcoin ETFs have continued to dominate institutional demand for crypto assets since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the funds. Inflows spiked the total digital assets market cap above $3.3 trillion, gaining over 4% in the US trading hours. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) recorded 5,250 Bitcoins in the last 24 hours. This shows growing institutional demand for BTC and other crypto assets, swinging the price past the $100K mark. BlackRock’s inflow outpaced the total daily production, signaling high institutional demand as bulls resume accumulation. Data from Farside shows that the total inflows on Jan 16 stood at $626 million, with IBIT and ArkInvests ARKB controlling the charts. IBIT captured 85% of demand, while the latter saw a huge $155 million in the same time frame. IBIT volumes outpaced both institutional investors and BTC production. The fund recorded 12 times more than the daily 450 Bitcoin production. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC notched $4.4 million,n while Bitwise’s fund attracted $2.7 million. BlackRock has remained a popular option for most institutional investors since its launch. The fund has over $55.6 billion in assets under management (AUM), exposing traditional investors to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s bid for an ETF in 2023 spiked interest from other traditional firms that filed similar applications. After the approval, the surge in applications and demand ignited the bull cycle, taking the asset price to an all-time high above $73K in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiast Solana Legend tipped a higher target for the wider market due to surging ETF demand and other factors. “We have the richest man in the world joining forces with the president to kick off a golden age for emergent technology BTC ETF is the most successful ETF launch of all time Strategic Crypto Reserve being floated. Adjust your targets higher.” The success of Bitcoin products increased investor appetite, leading to a demand for altcoin products. After the launch of spot Ethereum ETF, several firms have filed for Solana and XRP products. Skyrocketing optimism has also led to huge inflows in these assets ahead of anticipated pro-crypto legislation. While the present administration was hostile to the market, Donald Trump has pledged a pro-market approach, giving investors confidence. Demand for spot XRP products in the United States is a major factor for the sharp increase in price.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/02/3-high-yield-closed-end-funds-to-buy-tech-stocks-for-less/

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.
