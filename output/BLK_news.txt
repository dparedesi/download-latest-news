As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January after beating Kamala Harris in the elections, his proposal to establish a strategic national Bitcoin reserve is gaining momentum across the United States. Pennsylvania lawmakers have introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act, legislation that would allow the state treasury to invest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Following in the footsteps of Senator Cynthia Lummis’ similar proposal, Pennsylvania lawmakers introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act in the state’s House of Representatives on Thursday. The bill, sponsored by Republican Pennsylvania state Rep. Mike Cabell, would allow the treasury to allocate up to 10% of its $7 billion state funds into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and to diversify beyond traditional assets. “The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is a visionary step toward securing our state’s financial future,” Cabell stated. Cabell argued that many renowned financial institutions and nation-states, including the United States, have invested in Bitcoin to protect their funds from economic volatility. Moreover, high-profile investment companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are now offering their customers Bitcoin options, while U.S. states such as Wisconsin have also made strategic investments in crypto assets. “The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is a visionary step toward securing our state’s financial future. By integrating Bitcoin into our reserves, we’re not only protecting Pennsylvania from inflation’s relentless impact but also positioning our state as a leader in financial resilience and innovation,” the state representative added. Mike Cabell stressed that the bill sends a straightforward message: “Pennsylvania is ready to embrace bold, modern solutions to safeguard economic prosperity for generations to come.” If the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is passed, it would position the state as the first in the country to hold the premier crypto directly on its balance sheet. This could potentially mark a transition toward a more serious integration of crypto assets into governmental economic strategies. The legislation would also set a precedent for other states considering similar moves. On the federal level, Senator Lummis introduced a similar bill dubbed the “Boosting Innovation, Technology and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act of 2024”, or the BITCOIN ACT. The bill maps out a path for the U.S. states and federal agencies to invest in Bitcoin.

Hiking is a great way of staying in shape and a proven gateway to a healthy and positive lifestyle. At summer’s end, however, many retreat to the fireside believing that winter walking is for masochists. Wrong! Winter walking doesn’t have to be all heroics and hardship, for we now have many low-difficulty trails ideal for those who enjoy a winter ramble. And the good news is that the trails listed below have an atmospheric eatery on the trail or nearby, offering hot beverages and tasty bites. Bray Coastal Camino, Wicklow/Dublin Commemorating pilgrims who walked to Dublin before sailing to complete the Camino, this 30km walk links Bray with Dublin city centre, so it is almost entirely within an urban setting. This may seem off-putting, but this is actually a highly varied walk, offering much to discover and memorable sea views. It is best enjoyed as a two-day walk, finishing the first day in Dún Laoghaire. Along the way, you will enjoy Bray Seafront, Shanganagh Park, Seafield Coastal Path, Killiney Beach, Bullock Harbour, the Forty-Foot bathing place and the James Joyce Tower, which houses a museum devoted to the writer’s life. The next day’s highlights include Blackrock Park, Booterstown Nature Reserve, Grand Canal Dock and Christ Church Cathedral. Finish at the Church of St James on James St and then pop in next door for a hot beverage in Groundstate Coffee Shop. The Coastal Camino is not waymarked, but a comprehensive turn-by-turn account of the route is available within the Bray Celtic Camino brochure. This can be downloaded from the website of the Irish Camino Society. caminosociety.ie The Derry Walls, Co Derry Sublimely situated on the River Foyle, Derry offers an intriguing mix of outstanding architecture with historic resonance and makes an ideal gateway to the Donegal Highlands or the Causeway Coast. The city’s show pony is, however, its 1.5km of city walls. Built to withstand canon fire, the walls are 9m wide and make a perfect breezy winter walk with expansive views over the city, the famous Bogside Murals, the Creggan and the red white and blue bedecked Fountain Estate. And if you require more information, there are two museums along the way. The Tower Museum tells the full story of the city from the time of its foundation by St Columba, while the Siege Museum recounts how the Derry Apprentice Boys resisted the attempt by King James II to capture the city during the siege of 1689. Just beneath the walls, an enchanting little Craft Village offers an eclectic mix of artisan shops, restaurants, and atmospheric coffee shops. thederrywalls.com Scilly Walk, Kinsale, Co Cork Renowned for its sea views, the Scilly Walk represents a “must do” 6km walk for anyone visiting Kinsale. Take the footpath along the Lower Road from the town centre and up the hill to the Spaniard Pub, where you swing right down a narrow lane. With the sea a constant presence to your right, continue until the route dives inland through woodlands to gain High Road. Go right here, through picturesque Summercove and then up the hill to the magnificent viewing point over Kinsale Harbour at Charles Fort. Afterwards, retrace your steps, stopping for a hot beverage at the cosy and firelit Bulman Bar in Summercove or the atmospheric Spaniard Inn further up the hill. kinsale.ie Sherkin Island, Co Cork Ireland’s offshore islands are generally for summer, but Sherkin is an exception. An all-year-round island because of its proximity to the coast, the regular ferry service involves just a 10-minute sea crossing of a sheltered harbour from the salty, maritime village of Baltimore. A nice walk to acquaint yourself with the island, the 2km Horseshoe Loop begins from near the island pier and follows tracks and quiet roads above Horseshoe Harbour. About halfway around, you have the option of tagging the blue arrows for about 1km to reach Blue Flag, Silver Strand, offering an expansive vista across multi-islanded Roaringwater Bay to Cape Clear Island. Retrace your steps and then complete the Horseshoe Loop. For a warm beverage, the nearby Jolly Roger, which opens Friday, Saturday and Sunday from noon with light bites until 4pm is your best bet. Otherwise, return to Bushes Bar, Baltimore, to enjoy your beverage and maybe a delicious crab sandwich. alltrails.com [ Ireland’s pilgrim paths: ‘I only go to Mass for weddings and funerals now, but you experience the goodness of people on these walks’Opens in new window ] Ardmore Cliff Walk, Co Waterford This 5km stroll offers spectacular coastal views and a sense of reconnecting with history. Start from the centre of Ardmore by keeping the ocean on your left as you ascend while following the signs for the Cliff Walk. Pass the Cliff House Hotel and continue by the early Christian Church and Well of St Declan. Beyond, the path meanders spectacularly around Ardmore Head, with great declivities falling left to the wreck of the Sampson crane ship, which foundered in 1988. Rounding Rams Head, you will be rewarded with a photogenic panorama over Youghal Bay to the east Cork coastline. Now swing inland to explore St Declan’s Monastery. Occupying a striking location, the most prominent landmarks are the 30m high round tower and the roofless 12th century cathedral, which represents one of Ireland’s finest examples of Romanesque architecture. After that, it’s just a short ramble downhill to Ardmore for a beverage and a bite in the family-run Whitehorses Restaurant. ardmorewaterford.com Drumleague Loop Walk, Co Leitrim As befits a canal towpath, this is an easy waterside walk on a level surface. From Battlebridge Lock, which lies about 1km west of Leitrim village on the R284, follow the signs for the Leitrim Way and keep the Lough Allen Canal on your right to reach Drumleague Lock after about 2.5km. Go right across the bridge and then head south along L7381 which follows the opposite bank of the canal for about 2.5km to regain Battlebridge. If you wish to extend your walk, you can follow the canal for another 2.5km to reach Drumhauver Bridge. Cross the canal again and return by the opposite bank. From Drumhauver, you can extend your walk by 1km to sample the unique Floating Boardwalk on Acres Lake, but you will have to follow the same side of the canal on your return. For your hot beverage and maybe more, Beirnes of Battlebridge, an award-winning Gastropub, is open for food from Thursday to Sunday. Otherwise, it is just a 10-minute footpath walk to Leitrim Village, where there are several good food offerings. leitrimtourism.com One of Ireland’s oldest planned settlements, Abbeyleix is now an outstanding heritage town that rewards visitors with an easy 4.5km, walking trail. Starting from the car park at the Manor Hotel, follow the green arrows for the Collins Bog Loop across the N77 and continue through the sylvan paths of Abbeyleix Demesne. Then, it’s back across the N77 and on to a green lane leading to Killamuck Bog, which is managed by local volunteers and has a boardwalk giving access to its peaty heartland. Here, you have the option of diverting to the 8km Killamuck Loop by going right and trailing the purple arrows as they circumnavigate the entire bog. Otherwise, continue following the green arrows left along the edge of the bog and then onwards through serene woodland to regain the Manor House, Hotel. discoverireland.ie/laois For your beverage, it’s Polly’s Café, conveniently located beside your parking place. Open seven days a week, it has covered seating with glass walls, heating and serves warm drinks, cakes, sandwiches and salads. [ Nine storied Irish walks: from rebel hills to drowned Spanish sailorsOpens in new window ] Waterford Greenway, Co Waterford From the car park at Waterford’s South East Technological University, West Campus, follow the signs for the Waterford Greenway. Once on the greenway, go left and continue for about 3km with the River Suir a constant presence to your left. When you see the sign pointing left for Mount Congreve, pop in to the Stables Restaurant for a heartwarming beverage. At this stage, it would be remiss not to visit the famous gardens that were created, as a passion project, by industrialist Ambrose Congreve and have long been regarded as among the world’s finest, (admission charge applies). Afterwards, with an enhanced feeling of peace and wellbeing, retrace your steps to SETU, car park. greenwaysireland.org/waterford-greenway/ Aherlow winter Walking Festival, Co Tipperary (January 24th to 26th) Walking festivals have recently been popping up countrywide like buds in May. Unsurprisingly, they are entirely confined to our warmer months, with just one exception; the canny folks from the Glen of Aherlow have their festival at the coldest time of year and have reaped a rich reward with an event that has been running for over a decade. This isn’t surprising for the Glen of Aherlow is a true gem for walkers with the Slievenamuck range offering great low and moderate outings. To the south, the Galtee Mountains provide long challenging circuits on Ireland’s highest inland range, which is regularly snow-covered in January. At day’s end, treat yourself to a hot drink in the Huntsman’s Bar of old world Aherlow House Hotel, which is the base for the event.

Title: The brain-computer interface revolution is just getting started

Time Published: 2024-11-16T00:13:17Z

Whether it’s jacking into the Matrix or becoming a Na’avi in Avatar, connecting brains to computers is a science-fiction trope that I never thought I’d see become a reality. But increasingly, BCIs (brain-computer interfaces) have become a serious area of study in research labs, rapidly advancing from research labs to real human trials — perhaps most famously by the Elon Musk’s company Neuralink. While this promises individuals with disabilities a greater degree of freedom and control, along with potential applications in gaming and health care, significant technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges remain. But the more I dug into the topic, the more I found leaders and researchers rising to the occasion to lead us responsibly into the future of the this groundbreaking technology. Let’s start at the beginning. In a sentence, BCIs are devices that bridge the gap, essentially translating, between your brain’s analog electrical signals and external digital machines. “Bypassing the conventional communication channels for different tasks (e.g., vision, movement, and speech), BCI links the brain’s electrical activity and the external world to augment human capabilities in interacting with the physical environment,” a 2023 study from the journal Brain Inform reads. “BCI provides a non-muscular communication channel and facilitates acquisition, manipulation, analysis, and translation of brain signals to control external devices or applications.” Early BCI development actually began back in the 1920’s with the advent of the electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that uses electrodes to amplify and then measure electrical activity in the brain. However, modern BCIs evolved in the 1970s through the work of UCLA’s Dr. Jacques Vidal, with funding from the National Science Foundation and DARPA. He was the first researcher to coin the term “brain-computer interface” as well. Over the last half century, BCIs have found clinical use in a variety of applications, from mapping the inner workings of the brain to augmenting human cognition and motor skills. BCIs are even being used to restore physical mobility in patients suffering from injury and disease, such as ALS or brainstem stroke, or folks who are “locked-in” — cognitively intact but without useful muscle function. The potential is incredibly exciting, but as you can likely imagine, there are some seemingly insurmountable challenges that the researchers of this technology are having to face head-on. You might assume that all modern brain-computer interfaces involve brain surgery, but the technology actually comes in many forms, depending on how close to the user’s gray matter the device is situated. There are wholly non-invasive types that we’re all familiar with, such as EEGs and MRIs, which simply monitor and record brain activity. Then, there are what is classified as “partially-invasive” endovascular EEGs, which use a catheter to deliver electrodes into the brain without requiring open brain surgery. Non-invasive BCIs pick up the brain’s electrical impulses through the patient’s skull and scalp and transmit them directly to the external device. While this sounds appealing in that it doesn’t require brain surgery, the technology is rife with challenges. One of the biggest problems with externally-worn BCIs, for example, is their low signal-to-noise ratios. This means that the electrical impulses picked up are often muddled with interference from the skull and scalp, making it difficult to accurately decode brain signals. Decoding these signals is further complicated by the brain’s intricate neural patterns, which require sophisticated algorithms and significant computational resources to interpret reliably. I spoke with Dr. Jane Huggins, the director of the University of Michigan Direct Brain Interface Laboratory, to further understand the challenges presented in BCIs seen today. “Let’s make a list of the things that affect your brain activity … well, maybe let’s make a list of the things that don’t because that’s going to be a shorter list,” Huggins quipped. “Everything from what the patient is currently seeing to the amount of light in the room to what they just ate for lunch to their emotional state, all can affect the amplitude of the signals and the complexity of what’s going on. It’s hard to pick out the pieces that you need.” Meanwhile, in terms of comfort and usability, non-invasive BCIs can be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods due to bulky electrodes and headsets. It’s why the idea of invasive brain implants has become the future of where this technology is headed, a future that came barreling into the present in 2024 like never before. Implantable BCIs takes the impulses directly from the brain matter the chip is sitting on and translates them into commands. It then wirelessly relays those command signals to an external device, which carries them out. Dr. Huggins makes the case that although some people will always be uneasy about the idea of implanting a device in your brain, in the long run, it’s the most convenient option. “People have a tendency to refer to implanted BCIs as ‘invasive,'” she told me. “Certainly there’s surgery involved if you’re implanting a BCI and it can be quite a dramatic surgery.” On the other hand, Huggins likens it to her own artificial hip surgery she received a couple of years back. Invasive surgery? Yes. But in daily live, they can be forgotten about entirely. For one, implanted BCIs don’t require the 10- to 20-minute setup needed to operate them daily. They also don’t require charging and cleaning as external BCIs do. Huggins posited that future BCI devices could offer the benefits from both externally worn and implanted BCIs, similar to how today’s cochlear implants operate. “If you could implant those EEG electrodes under the scalp, you wouldn’t have to put them on and take them off every day, and they would be invisible.” Furthermore, the basics of the technology has been around longer than you might assume. It’s been decades since the first neuroprostheses were installed in humans, and the field continues to expand at a rapid pace. That’s leads us to where we are today, with the first patients receiving these implanted chips. After a six-year study and getting FDA approval in 2023, Neuralink launched its clinical trial for its first implantable chip, completing the surgery in January of 2024 on its first patient. In just a couple of months, Neuralink had posted an update, showing the patient controlling a laptop to play online only with his brain, which he compared to “using the Force on the cursor.” By now, Neuralink’s BCI trial has found a second patient, while the first has gone from playing chess to playing Civilization VI. Neuralink gets all the spotlight due to its high-profile founder, but it’s far from alone. Brooklyn New York’s Synchron, which is developing a device that can be safely implanted into the brain’s blood vessels, began its six-patient clinical trial last year. BrainGate, a research cadre amalgamated from universities across the U.S., implanted the world’s first wireless, high-bandwidth BCI in 2021. Blackrock Neurotech, on the other hand, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has been running human trials with its Utah array BCI for more than two decades with zero FDA-reported “serious adverse events” in that time. In these applications, the devices enable users to effectively bypass damaged and non-responsive limbs to control external devices directly with their thoughts and perform activities without depending on healthy people, significantly improving the quality of their lives. The technology has already revolutionized a number of fields of research, including entertainment and gaming, industrial automation, education, and neuromarketing. While implanted BCIs feel like the future of the field, but they certainly come with their own challenges. For example, even with implanted BCIs, which provide a higher quality of signal, long-term stability remains an issue. These devices can degrade over time due to biological tissue reactions or mechanical failures, limiting their usability and lifespan for continuous applications. The implanted BCI also doesn’t overcome the hurdle of all the training and calibration required, which poses a significant challenge for BCI technology. Users often need extensive practice to gain effective control over these devices, making the process both time-consuming and sometimes frustrating, as Dr. Huggins explained. Neuralink has an app in development to help with this process, helping patients along to train their minds to better control digital devices, which has already been tested with monkeys. Beyond convenience and cost, the technology’s ethical and privacy consequences pose significant challenges to BCI’s further development. The data generated by BCIs — our emotions, intentions, and thoughts — are intrinsically personal and raises the risk that such data could be unintentionally collected and misused. BCIs adoption also creates issues with autonomy, consent, and accessibility. What’s to stop someone from being forced to use a BCI against their will or without fully understanding its consequences? “I can think of nothing scarier than having someone decide for you that you want an implanted BCI and give it to you,” Huggins said. “And you can’t ask any questions about what’s going on or express your opinion.” The same is true for leveraging AI and machine learning systems to assist BCI patients. “We can combine a lot of the [functions of] artificial intelligence and BCIs, but that does start raising the same kind of questions you run into with any kind of share and control: Who’s deciding? What’s going to be said?” “And that gets back to the ethical questions we were talking about earlier about self-determination. If you have someone whose abilities are deteriorating [such as ALS patients], is there a balance? Will that balance change over time? Or am I just going to give up and start letting the AI auto-complete my sentences?” “Don’t worry about people reading your thoughts from satellites.” These are serious concerns for the future, even if we’re still a long way off from really needing to face them. “I’m only able to pick that up with, you know, 90% accuracy, maybe 95% accuracy on a good day. On a bad day, well, you can go as low as as low as possible on a bad day. But that’s someone who is actively voluntarily trying to communicate a message.” Huggins makes the point to quell one of the biggest challenges to the future of BCI: fear and misconceptions. “It scares a lot of people,” Huggins conceded. “I had somebody ask me once if the government could read their thoughts from satellites. And I was like, ‘well, you know, I have trouble getting the correct answer when I have somebody sitting in my lab who let me put this headset on and is actively trying to pay attention to a key on the keyboard. Don’t worry about people reading your thoughts from satellites.” Certainly, BCI researchers face considerable challenges in bringing this revolutionary technology to the general public, perhaps none more so than managing expectations. Huggins notes that her colleagues who work with implanted research studies go through a very rigorous process to make sure that participants in those studies understand what the plan is as well as a realistic understanding of the benefits and the risks. Those same courtesies are rarely extended to the general public who are bombarded with fantastical promises of telepathic communication, perfect memory and recall, and even a melding of human and robotic minds. As for where BCI is heading in our lifetimes, Huggins conceded that a lowering of expectations would be necessary to really see the progress. “I think there will be things available, I just don’t think it will live up to all of the hype. It’s gonna change expectations. One needs to have expectations that are realistic, and understand that this is new technology. We’re still learning how it works, why it works, when it works, when it doesn’t work, what kind of support it needs, and how many places are going to be able to deliver it.” So no, we likely won’t be experiencing “Whoa, I know Kung Fu” moments in the foreseeable future. But that’s not to say that the next generation won’t. We might have a long way to go, but the foundation of those future experiences is being built today — and that’s reason to be excited. Elon Musk, the owner of Neuralink, said the company will be providing an update about its research on October 31. This comes shortly after reports surfaced of Musk's frustration with the slow progress. Neuralink aims to develop an interface that allows direct connection of a human brain and computer technology. If successful, you might someday expand your processing capabilities and sensory perception through hardware upgrades. That's the futuristic angle that Elon Musk pitched when first introducing this new endeavor. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is now in clinical trials on human patients, the first time this has ever happened in the United States. With all of the buzz around Neuralink, one might expect this breakthrough would come from Elon Musk's moonshot company. However, the honor goes to a lesser-known brain interface technology leader, Synchron, and its Stentrode device. While flashy claims of BCIs allowing VR games without a headset and amplifying human intelligence might make headlines, those are distant dreams. Meanwhile, tangible solutions to medical problems that affect patients today are being addressed by Synchron and other BCI innovators. Microsoft announced it will stop the development and distribution of controversial emotion-reading software as big tech companies pivot toward privacy and security. The company also says it will heavily restrict its own facial recognition platform. Microsoft’s shift away from emotional recognition software is another sign of big tech’s growing prioritization of privacy. The company also admits there is little scientific evidence behind the technology.

Title: Binance Sees Persistent Bitcoin Outflows as Price Holds Near $90,000, Signal of Long-Term Bullish Sentiment

On-chain data shows that there have been persistent outflows from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, even as the price of Bitcoin hovers around the $90,000 mark, down from a new all-time high above $93,000. As highlighted by a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Binance’s Exchange Netflow has consistently registered negative values over the past few weeks. The metric tracks the net movement of Bitcoin into or out of exchange wallets, with a negative value indicating a net outflow, suggesting that holders are opting to store their Bitcoin in self-custodial wallets, a bullish sign for the long-term outlook of the cryptocurrency. Net outflows are interpreted as a bullish signal given Bitcoin’s limited supply, as more coins being stored on-chain suggests available supply on exchanges is dropping, leading to potential price increases if demand remains or increases. A chart provided by CryptoQuant illustrates the significant negative spikes in Bitcoin Exchange Netflow for Binance earlier this month, coinciding with the recent rally. These large-scale accumulation moves likely contributed to the price surge. The outflows come as the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has seen over $3 billion of inflows over the past five days. As CryptoGlobe reported, the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States earlier this year have seen their total assets cross the $90 billion mark after seeing a $6 billion ump in a single day, and are now over three-thirds of the way of surpassing gold ETFs in assets. That’s according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) pointed out that spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $6 billion jump in a day came with $1 billion of inflows, and $5 billion of market appreciation amid a significant BTC price rise. Notably, cryptocurrency investment products have also been seeing significant inflows, bringing in $1.98 billion in the week after Republican candidate Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. According to CoinShares latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the inflows couple with the cryptocurrency market rally have pushed the total assets under management of crypto investment products to a $116 billion high. The report details that Bitcoin-focused investment products saw $1.79 billion inflows over the past week, while Ethereum-focused products saw $157 million inflows. Featured image via Unsplash.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Stocks tumbled on Friday as the post-election rally fizzled and investors fretted over the path of interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to end at 43,444.99. The S&P 500 slipped 1.32% and closed at 5,870.62, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.24% to 18,680.12. Declines in pharmaceutical stocks weighed on the 30-stock Dow and broader S&P 500, with Amgen down about 4.2% and Moderna off by 7.3%. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) tumbled more than 5% and posted its worst week since 2020. The information technology sector of the S&P 500 was the worst performing corner of the market, down more than 2% as Nvidia, MetaPlatforms, Alphabet and Microsoft tumbled. Tesla was a rare exception among its Magnificent Seven peers, as shares of the electric vehicle giant and so-called “Trump Trade” were higher by 3%. “While we think the macro backdrop still bodes well for risk assets, in the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration,” said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. “We expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don’t expect that rise to happen in a straight line.” Traders also grappled with recent comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said on Thursday that the central bank wasn’t “in a hurry” to cut interest rates. He noted that the economy’s strong growth will permit policymakers to take their time as they decide the extent to which they reduce rates. Boston Fed President Susan Collins took the cautious sentiment further, telling The Wall Street Journal that a rate cut next month isn’t a certainty. October retail sales data on Friday showed a 0.4% increase, slightly better than the 0.3% forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones. That finding follows an October consumer inflation report that was in line with economists’ projections. The major averages had been coasting on a post-election rally since Trump’s victory at the polls — the three indexes touched fresh highs on Monday — but the upward momentum has been slowing. The S&P 500 posted a weekly loss of 2.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite slid about 3.2%. The 30-stock Dow fell 1.2% in the period.

Title: Establishment Economists Threaten Trump: Deportations Will Spike Inflation
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/11/15/establishment-economists-threaten-trump-deportations-will-spike-inflation/
Time Published: 2024-11-15T21:29:40Z

Establishment economists are threatening President-elect Donald Trump with a new round of inflation if he restores Americans’ civil right to a secure national border. But the free market will manage the inflation threat by hiring Americans in place of deported migrants, and by investing in productivity-raising machinery, responded EJ Antoni, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. “I see no reason why the adjustment would not happen almost immediately,” he told Breitbart News. In 2017, for example, shortly after Trump first cracked down on migration, meatpacking giant Tysons Food allocated $500 million to begin automating its slaughterhouses and by raising wages many other companies also hired sidelined workers, including ex-convicts, and disabled people. Democrat-aligned economists and media outlets raised the alarm this week as Trump appointed immigration reformers to key posts. “If you’re talking about deporting millions of people, that is an invitation to labor shortages and bottlenecks,” former treasury secretary Larry Summers told CNN on November 15. “If he carries through on what he said during his campaign, there will be an inflation shock significantly greater than the one the country suffered in 2021,” he declared. “If [agriculture sector] workers are deported, the food industry will probably have great difficulty replacing them,” New York Times economist Paul Krugman wrote on November 11. “The industry will have to offer much higher wages [to hire American workers] — and, of course, these higher wages will be passed on in higher [inflated grocery] prices.” Their threats are being echoed by CEOs who hire migrants: The claimed economic damage from migration is also being echoed by business reporters who largely avoided migrants’ economic impact throughout Biden’s presidency. “Trump’s Immigration Plans Could Bring an Economic Toll,” a New York Times economics reporter wrote on November 13. “If Mr. Trump accomplishes anything close to what he has pledged [on migration], many economists expect higher prices on goods and services and possibly lower employment rates for American workers,” the article claimed. Both Summers and Krugman have long supported the establishment’s economic strategy of extracting migrants from poor countries to stimulate the U.S. consumer economy. That Extraction Migration strategy is good for elite investors on Wall Street — but has been terrible for and unpopular among many millions of ordinary Americans who voted Trump into power. Now both economists are defending that Extraction Migration strategy with warnings about deportations and inflation — while they also ignore obvious economic factors that can prevent inflation. Those factors include greater corporate investment in productivity, the shift of Americans from low-value jobs to higher-wage jobs, and the hiring of several million men who have been pushed out of the workforce over the last few decades. Job-Switching Americans Deported migrants cannot be replaced by Americans, Krugman insists: That [backup] workforce isn’t there. We have essentially full employment among native-born Americans. There is no reserve of Americans to take these jobs, by and large jobs that native-born Americans would be very reluctant to take. But the U.S. economy employs 170 million people, including roughly 6 million Biden migrants. That huge labor force ensures successful companies can hire workers from unsuccessful companies. In addition, “there are roughly 18.5 million working-age U.S.-born men [who are] not in the labor force,” Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. Those people are not even counted as unemployed because they have given up searching for jobs, he said. This population of workforce dropouts helps create other civic problems, such as drug deaths, lower rates of marriage, and declining births, he said: They don’t have partners anymore who push them to work, right? They don’t have children they have to support. The [civic] norm of supporting children and partners if you have them is way down. We know that the men most likely not to work are those who are unmarried, those who have children, and those who don’t live with their children. “We could maybe bring 5 million of them back into jobs,” he said. “That might be a reasonable kind of goal.” Trump’s Vice President, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), slammed the employers’ divisive claim that migrants fill jobs that Americans do not want. In October, he told a surprised New York Times journalist: One of the really deranged things that I think illegal immigration does to our society is it gets us in a mind-set of saying we can only build houses with illegal immigrants when we have [sidelined] seven million — just men, not even women, just men — who have completely dropped out of the labor force. Moreover, many Americans have been pushed out of white-collar jobs because of illegal and legal white-collar migration. If Trump enforces the border laws at U.S. airports, employers can rehire the U.S. college grads they fired. Many older Americans have retired, and some may be drawn back into work by the promise of higher wages that can augment Social Security checks. Productivity Neither Krugman nor Summers mentioned the reality that companies can solve labor shortages by investing in labor-saving machinery. “There are certain occupations that are really very heavily immigrant,” Krugman said, adding: top of the list would be food. Agricultural workers, about three quarters are immigrants and probably about half of them are undocumented. Meat packing is probably between 30 and 50 percent undocumented immigrants. So the whole food supply chain is reliant on people who are going to be rounded up and put in camps. When Trump shrank the inflow of migrants in 2017, wages rose and companies started buying more labor-saving machinery, such as automated cow-milking devices. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Costco opened a new slaughterhouse to process millions of chickens with technology developed in Iceland for its seafood industry. Watch: In fact, a labor shortage can be a good thing for economic growth and prosperity, BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia: “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth … But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. However, “if you have a huge flood of [migrant] labor into the market, especially if it’s all low-skill labor, you reduce the incentive for business capital investment,” said Antoni. In Biden’s four years, labor productivity grew by only 0.7 percent annually, according to Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who worked for President Barack Obama. The Biden failure is displayed in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, where a rush of Biden migrants allows a food company to profit from a cheap, l0w-tech, food-processing plant. AmericanCompass.org reported: A Charleroi business owner invited CBS News into his factory to see the work being done by migrant workers. Though only a few seconds of video is shown in the CBS report, the main task one sees workers doing in the video is manually moving bowls of food from one conveyor belt onto another. It’s not difficult to imagine automation playing a greater role in that process. “I have a hard time getting anyone to talk about productivity, let alone productivity related to migrants,” Antoni said. The slow productivity growth under Biden helped minimize wage gains for Americans. The resulting poverty helped Trump win in November. The same process of immigration, poverty, and political unrest is underway in Canada and the United Kingdom. In both countries, productivity and wages have fallen as millions of migrants were imported to expand the countries’ consumer economies. Unhappy voters in the U.K. evicted the Prime Minister this year, and Canadian voters are expected to force the retirement of Justin Trudeau in 2025. Migrants’ Impact on Inflation Biden’s deputies imported migrants to help suppress wages and wage inflation amid Congress’s massive spending. However, those migrants boosted inflation in the housing sector. The migration-inflated rents prompted many younger Americans to back Trump in November. “He was seen as a change agent, as an alternative to a status quo marked by inflation and the migrant crisis,” Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) told the Atlantic. As Trump sends Biden’s migrants home, rents will drop, he will help reverse the inflation that is threatened by Krugman and Summers — while also providing a windfall bonus to millions of young Americans who rent housing. In Canada, Prime Minister Justice Trudeau is trying to save his career by curbing his migration flood. That is good news for ordinary Canadians, Robert Kavcic, a bank economist, told CBC News. “The first thing you’re going to see here is a lot of the pressure that we’ve been facing in the Canadian economy starting to get alleviated … specifically pressure on rents,” he said. Florida Krugman warned that the enforcement of immigration laws by Gov. Ron. DeSantis has been “disastrous” for the state’s agricultural sector: I’ve been looking a little bit of a dress rehearsal for some of this [Trump policy] in DeSantis’ Florida, where he’s done a crackdown. The results for Florida agriculture have already been disastrous. But Floridians are gaining wages and benefits because DeSantis cracked down on the use of illegal labor, ABC Action News reported in September 2024: Career Source of Hillsborough and Pinellas [a government-funded training program] says local employers are offering more incentives such as transportation and childcare subsidies. “Jobseekers, what they’re looking for is employers that offer flexibility in schedule, living wage and a company that they want to work for versus need to work for,” [Caeer Source official] Mario Rodriguez said. That trend of fewer migrants and higher wages has been good news for Republicans and Trump, who won the state in a November landslide. The rising wages are also forcing companies and farmers to invest in more labor-saving technology that helps to calm worker shortages and further push up voters’ wages. Many research companies are already rolling out new generations of labor-saving equipment that can free up many workers for other jobs. “More than 706,000 jobs in Florida will be cut or impacted by automation and technology in some way,” the South Florida Business Journal reported in October. Arizona In the mid-2000s, a citizen ballot in Arizona forced state officials to crack down on illegal labor. Because of the 40 percent drop in illegal labor, the wages earned by Americans rose significantly, according to a 2016 analysis by Moody’s Analytics, which strongly supports more migration. A 2016 investigation in the pro-migration Wall Street Journal reported: The median income of low-skilled whites who did manage to get jobs rose about 6% during that period, the economists estimate … wages rose about 15% for Arizona farmworkers and about 10% for construction between 2010 and 2014 … Some employers say their need for workers has increased since then, leading them to boost wages more rapidly and crimping their ability to expand … graduates [at a federal job-training center] now often mull two or three jobs offers from construction firms and occasionally start at $14.65 an hour instead of $10. Housing prices fell, allowing more young Americans to start families, according to the Journal: “It was like, ‘Where did everybody go?’ ” says Teresa Acuna, a Phoenix real-estate agent who works in Latino neighborhoods. Real-estate agent Patti Gorski says her sales records show that prices of homes owned by Spanish-speaking customers fell by 63% between 2007 and 2010, compared with a 44% drop for English-speaking customers, a difference she attributes partly to financial pressure on owners who had been renting homes to immigrants who departed. Productivity climbed as companies invested in machinery, said the Journal: [Farmer] Rob Knorr couldn’t find enough Mexican field hands to pick his jalapeño peppers. He sharply reduced his acreage and invested $2 million developing a machine to remove pepper stems. His goal was to cut the number of laborers he needed by 90% and to hire higher-paid U.S. machinists instead … He says mechanization is his future. He continues to pour time and money into a laser-guided device to remove stems from peppers, which pickers now do by hand in the field. Another farmer in the area developed a mechanical carrot harvester. Conclusion “It is very difficult to find accurate analysis in this area, because pretty much everyone seems to approach it from the standpoint of their own agenda,” said Antoni. For people who favor “illegal aliens coming to this country — which is essentially what this administration has been doing for the last four years — they come out with what are essentially fraudulent economic analyses that only look at the alleged benefits of illegal immigration and don’t look at any of the costs,” he said.

Since the Energia All-Ireland League resumed after the Covid hiatus, save for Young Munster replacing Lansdowne in the semi-finals two seasons ago, a big four have asserted themselves. But after six rounds in Division 1A this season, three of that quartet, namely Terenure, the champions Cork Con and Lansdowne, have already lost 10 games between them. Such is the changed landscape in the top flight, with St Mary’s especially taking to life in 1A like a storm, while Ballynahinch top the table. Those two and Clontarf have opened up a seven-point lead from the peloton, whereas just six points separate the teams from fourth to ninth. The net effect has been to leave Lansdowne, Cork Con and Terenure in real need of home wins today against Clontarf, St Mary’s and Garryowen respectively. Injury-hit and beaten at home by Ballynahinch through a late penalty last week, Lansdowne welcome back fullback Cathal Eddy, winger Rory Parata, outhalf Stephen Madigan, scrumhalf Jack Matthews, hooker Chris Poole, tighthead Greg McGrath, lock Juan Beukes and Donough Lawlor at number eight. By contrast, although Clontarf are without Aitzol Arenzana-King, who is on Leinster A duty and so bring in Mark O’Sullivan, their only other change is Charlie Ward at tighthead. Billy Crowley starts at fullback for Con, who have a new halfback partnership of Adam Maher and Aidan Moynihan, while there is one change up front, with Charlie Connolly starting at tighthead and Luke Masters shifting to loosehead against a St Mary’s side who they trail by eight points. Buoyed by their derby win over Terenure in front of an estimated 3,500 attendance at home last week, St Mary’s name an unchanged team. Their neighbours, meanwhile, make a multitude of changes for the visit of Garryowen to Lakelands Park. Aran Egan moves to fullback, with Adam La Grue shifting to midfield in the absence of Chris Cosgrave, who is on trial at Bath, and where he is partnered by Ethan Reilly. With Fintan Gunne on Leinster A duty, Alan Bennie returns alongside Conor McKeon, the former Connacht scrumhalf. Props Marcus Hanan and Luke Rigney are also named, with Adam Melia moving to lock as the ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey and Jim White are promoted to the backrow. An inconsistent Young Munster host an improving and competitive City of Armagh side while, needless to say, the untimely A interpro between Connacht Eagles and Leinster in Creggs RFC has impacted most severely on UCD and Corinthians. Six UCD players feature in Leinster’s starting XV which thus restricts their hand for the trek to leaders Ballynahinch, on a run of four successive wins. Similarly, the Eagles have drawn heavily from Corinthians, who lead 2A with 29 points out of a possible 30 and host third-placed Cashel, taking seven players in total including the Ireland Under-20 pair of Seán Naughton and John Devine, with Orin Burke shifting to outhalf and Harry Rogers promoted to fullback. Second-placed Instonians host fourth-placed MU Barnhall in the clubs’ first meeting since 2013. Men Division 1A: Cork Constitution v St Mary’s College, Temple Hill; Lansdowne v Clontarf, Aviva Stadium back pitch; Terenure College v Garryowen, Lakelands; Young Munster v City of Armagh, Tom Clifford Park. Division 1B: Old Wesley v Highfield, Energia Park (2.15); Naas v Blackrock College, Forenaughts; Queen’s v Old Belvedere, Dub Lane; UCC v Dublin University, The Mardyke (3.0); Shannon v Nenagh Ormond, Thomond Park (5.0). Division 2A: Instonians v MU Barnhall, Shaws Bridge (2.0); Corinthians v Cashel, Corinthian Park; Greystones v Buccaneers, Dr Hickey Park; Navan v Banbridge, Balreask Old; Old Crescent v Ballymena, Takumi Park. Division 2B: Dungannon v Galwegians, Stevenson Park; Malahide v Wanderers, Estuary Road; Malone v UL Bohemian, Gibson Park; Skerries v Rainey, Holmpatrick; Sligo v Clogher Valley, Hamilton Park. Division 2C: Clonmel v Enniscorthy, Ardgaoithe; Dolphin v Ballyclare, Virgin Media Park; Monkstown v Belfast Harlequins, Sydney Parade; Omagh Academicals v Midlteon, Thomas Mellon Playing Fields; Tullamore v Bruff, Spollanstown. Women’s Division (5.0): Ballincollig v Blackrock College, Tanner Park; Cooke v Old Belvedere, Shaws Bridge; Galwegians v Railway Union, Crowley Park; Tullow v Suttonians, The Black Gates; Wicklow v UL Bohemian, Ashtown Lane.

Title: Why is cryptocurrency rising and bitcoin at an all-time high?

Getty Images Bitcoin is the most widely traded and well-known type of cryptocurrency. Since it was first created back in 2009, the value of bitcoin has fluctuated, often wildly at times, as awareness and interest in the digital currency shifts. Over the last decade, bitcoin's value has experienced significant volatility with large gains followed by precipitous declines. In 2017, bitcoin surged from around $1,000 in January to nearly $20,000 by December of that year. In 2018, bitcoin went the other way, with prices dropping below $4,000. 2020 was another wild swing, with value ranging from $7,000 to over $28,000 by the end of the year. The momentum continued into 2021, with bitcoin reaching a peak of $69,000 in November. Then, in 2022, the value of bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, dropped significantly during a period that is known as the crypto winter. At the time, bitcoin's price fell below $20,000 by the end of the year. However, 2023 marked a turnaround, with bitcoin closing the year at just over $42,000. 2024 has been a landmark year for Bitcoin, with several key events driving its price to new heights. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave regulatory approval for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds, including spot bitcoin ETFs. By March, bitcoin was trading at around $70,000. There was also a bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which also increased interest and value. Leading up to the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin's valuation was around $68,000 in Oct. 2024. After the election, bitcoin has been on a bull-run, reaching new highs almost daily. On Nov. 13, 2024, bitcoin hit a new all-time high of over $90,000, providing a lofty market capitalization of approximately $1.8 trillion USD. The Nov. 2024 surge in bitcoin's value can be attributed to several factors, each playing a crucial role in driving the cryptocurrency to new heights. However, the single biggest individual driver is the victory of President Trump in the U.S. general election on Nov. 4. Donald Trump's election victory has been a significant spark for bitcoin's price explosion. During the election campaign, at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump pledged to make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the planet." At the same event, Trump promised that if he was elected, he would appoint a cryptocurrency-friendly chairperson to the SEC. The idea under a Trump Administration is that there would be less regulation to limit cryptocurrency as well as more favorable policies put in place to support usage and adoption. As part of ensuring more cryptocurrency friendly policies are in place, Trump has also proposed creating a bitcoin and cryptocurrency presidential advisory council. The council will include individuals that are in favor of cryptocurrency. Going a step further, Trump has also stated that he would not allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to create its own digital currency. The pro-cryptocurrency stance and overall rhetoric coming from Trump has provided renewed confidence and exuberance to the price of bitcoin. The Trump win also led to an overall spike across U.S. stock markets in the days following the election. The Trump win provided additional momentum for bitcoin, on top of a series of other factors. In Jan. 2024, the SEC first allowed the creation of spot bitcoin ETFs. The Trump victory made those ETFs more popular with large inflows of new investor capital. On Nov. 11 and 12, bitcoin ETFs recorded the largest volume of capital inflows, since the ETF were first allowed in January. Approximately $2 billion of capital flowed into bitcoin ETF on those two days alone. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust is one of the biggest recipients of inflows with over $40 billion since the fund was created and is larger than any other ETF launched in the past decade. It is expected that overall the tech industry will see less regulation under a Trump administration. The process of deregulation could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency. Even the talk of deregulation has already played a part in the price gains for bitcoin in November. The prospect of deregulation under Trump's presidency has already driven bitcoin to record highs above $90,000, reflecting market optimism about a cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment As part of his campaign platform, Trump signaled plans to reduce regulation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry. Less regulation could mean more opportunities for cryptocurrency because there will be fewer restrictions. Trump's specific regulatory promises include the following: Another part of the Trump agenda that is helping to push bitcoin to all-time high price levels is the issue of taxes. There are several elements of the Trump agenda that will lower taxes and make cryptocurrency investing even more attractive to investors. Some of the proposed tax changes and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market include the following: When bitcoin started, it wasn't easy for the average retail investor to get involved. That's no longer the case. As more individuals become comfortable with digital assets, the user base for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues to expand, driving up demand and prices. There are now multiple ways for retail investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency to gain in value. Multiple other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Solana and even Dogecoin have all had big gains. The following table shows some of the gains: The outlook for cryptocurrency appears to be mostly optimistic, albeit with some uncertainties. Trump's pro-cryptocurrency agenda, including plans to establish a national bitcoin reserve, support U.S.-based mining and prevent the development of a central bank digital currency, could boost the cryptocurrency market. His promise to make the U.S. the "crypto capital" of the world might attract global innovators and investors. While the short-term market response has been positive, with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seeing significant gains, the long-term impact will depend on the actual implementation of these policies and broader economic factors. The implementation timeline for Trump's policies is uncertain. While the U.S. is an important market, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, which could impact the U.S. market regardless of domestic policies.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Now that Donald Trump has been elected to a second term as president, investors have had to reckon with paradigm shifts to their positioning, from tariffs to “DOGE.” There’s also the bogeyman of the ballooning debt that the US will take on if Trump enacts his campaign promises. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s plans will boost the debt by $7.75 trillion. While that’s not a "today problem" for investors, they're still grappling with what that increase could mean down the road. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock, told me at the Yahoo Invest conference this week. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and then obviously inflation relative to that.” Rieder laid out a scenario where “bond vigilantes” could attack. Essentially, if regular buyers of government Treasurys decide that Trump’s fiscal policies are inflationary, they could stage a strike, or sell en masse, driving up yields. That, in turn, would increase debt servicing costs for the US government and create a ripple effect throughout markets and the economy. Of course, US debt has been rising for years, and the federal government hasn’t had a surplus (with revenue exceeding spending) since the brief window between the end of the Clinton administration and the start of the George W. Bush administration. And markets have mostly looked the other way. John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer invoked Bill Gross’s famous “cleanest dirty shirt” comparison when explaining why: “The US stands out because of our accountability, our transparency, governance, and also our capability to innovate and the size of our economy,” he said in a recent interview. That said, Stoltzfus, like most market participants, says federal debt will become a problem … eventually. For now, it’s more a discussion point than an economic obstacle.

Photo Credit: X/ @Tether_to Tether is targeting businesses and governments as customers Tether Holdings Ltd., the world's largest digital asset company, is getting into the tokenisation of stocks, bonds, funds and commodities. The platform Hadron by Tether, launched Thursday, will allow users to convert assets into products ranging from stablecoins that are pegged to fiat to digital tokens backed by commodities or other forms of collateral. The British Virgin Islands-registered company is targeting businesses and governments as customers, Tether said in a statement. Turning assets into tokens can allow them to be traded quicker and at a lower cost. The assets can be traded on blockchains by transferring them from one cryptocurrency wallet to another. These potential advantages led Wall Street companies like BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Franklin Templeton to offer tokensed money market and mutual funds over the past couple years. Stablecoins, a form of crypto token pegged to another asset, use reserves to support their value. They are integral to the way crypto markets operate, acting as a less volatile alternative for traders looking to swap between digital assets and to store their wealth. Tether's stablecoin USDT, which is pegged to the dollar and backed by Treasuries and other assets, currently has over $126.6 billion tokens in circulation. The tokenisation platform is the latest effort by Tether to expand beyond its core business. The firm announced last week that it completed the funding of its first crude oil transaction in the Middle East as part of a plan to become a lender in commodities trading. The closely-held company has been the center of controversy in the past. Tether has previously faced fines from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and settled with the New York Authority General surrounding allegations that it lied about its reserves in the past and made misleading statements. © 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri shares how to invest as ETF inflows soar to records ahead of a promising 2025

Investors have poured money into the market at an unprecedented pace since Donald Trump's victory, though a veteran investment chief believes there's much more than politics at play. Inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shattered the record set in 2021 with more than a month and a half to spare, according to asset management titan BlackRock. The world's largest ETF issuer recently noted that $77 billion went into ETFs in the week after the election, which had never happened before. That surge coincided with the S&P 500's best week of 2024. Markets were especially euphoric immediately after election day. An astounding $22.3 billion went into US ETFs last Wednesday, and BlackRock's uber-popular iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) had its most active day of trading and inflows since 2007 as small caps soared by 5.8%. However, BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri doesn't think President-elect Trump deserves all the credit for this astounding market rally. The chief investment and portfolio strategist, Americas noted in a recent interview that US stocks had several strong catalysts before Trump's win. "Obviously, there have been some pretty sharp movements over the course of the last week," Chaudhuri told Business Insider. "But even as we look back to the quarter before that or since the beginning of this year, I think there have been some very solid fundamentals that have underpinned this movement." Robust growth for the economy and corporate earnings are some of the most salient market drivers, as are lower interest rates and receding inflation, Chaudhuri said. End-of-year rallies are also very common, especially in strong years for the market, as Truist recently remarked. Another convincing explanation for this recent market momentum is that investors had reduced risk as uncertainty mounted ahead of the election before quickly changing course when they got clarity on the path forward sooner and more decisively than anticipated. "Investors bringing down their portfolio risk going into elections was perhaps one of the reasons that we have seen this pretty strong re-risking in markets, especially after we got the election results," Chaudhuri said. As the new year approaches, Chaudhuri is rather confident about the US economy, even though a few recent developments seem to have given the glass-half-empty camp some ammunition. GDP growth and job additions have slipped lately, though neither is a major cause for concern for Chaudhuri. The economy didn't expand as much as expected in the third quarter, but GDP still rose at a healthy clip of 2.8%. And a weak October jobs figure appears to be largely due to the severe weather events that disrupted thousands of workers. Besides, more modest growth is a sign that the economy isn't overheating, which is welcome news to the Federal Reserve in its quest to ease financial conditions without reviving inflation. Such moderations aren't giving Chaudhuri pause about the trajectory of the US economy. "It would be very normal for us to continue to see a further normalization in the labor market, given how strong the economy has already been, how high rates are," Chaudhuri said. The investment chief added: "We haven't really seen that job destruction taking place quite yet. You're still seeing wages rising; you're not seeing layoffs pick up in a meaningful manner." Corporate earnings growth is arguably the most compelling reason to stick with US stocks following what's been another outstanding performance this year. Profits jumped about 7% in the third quarter, which is well above the mid-single-digit figure that analysts were banking on. "One of the things that the equity market has done over and over again is continue to surprise us in terms of earnings growth," Chaudhuri said. "I think companies have continued to find very innovative ways to manage their expenses. They've found a way, especially given the spend on AI, the type of CapEx that's going into finding ways to make companies have more productivity." Two sectors with abnormally strong earnings prospects are financials and industrials, Chaudhuri said. These economically sensitive groups enjoyed some of the larger post-election pops as Wall Street puts its chips on sectors that should benefit from a hot economy. And although smaller stocks have been on a heater, Chaudhuri believes that large, undervalued companies are the better place to be, given their superior earnings setup. "For a longer period of time, large cap is where we think the earnings growth is going to continue to be higher and better," Chaudhuri said. While earnings may not be under the microscope like they were when interest rates were at their peak, they're still top of mind for Chaudhuri. Larger stocks often have better earnings than their smaller peers, and the investment chief thinks that the cream will eventually rise to the top. "This catch-up trade that's happening in small caps right now has a little bit of legs," Chaudhuri said. "I think that can continue, maybe 'til the end of this month or even the end of next month." Chaudhuri continued: "But for us to believe in sustained rallies in small caps, we would need to see earnings growth, and over 50% of the small-cap index still is not very profitable." Jump to

Title: Michael Saylor: “I’m Already Planning the $100K Bitcoin Party for New Year’s Eve at My House”
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/michael-saylor-im-already-planning-the-100k-bitcoin-party-for-new-years-eve-at-my-house/

On November 14, Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), joined CNBC from the Caner Crypto, Digital Assets, and AI Infrastructure Conference in Miami. The discussion kicked off with CNBC host Morgan Brennan addressing the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, asking Saylor whether the rally was linked to the anticipation of how the new U.S. administration would impact crypto. Saylor immediately acknowledged that the recent shift in the political landscape, which he referred to as the “Red Wave,” has been a significant development for Bitcoin. He suggested that the change in political leadership was the most positive event for the cryptocurrency market in the past four years. According to Saylor, this shift, combined with supportive voices from Wall Street, notably BlackRock, has created a more favorable environment for Bitcoin’s value proposition. MicroStrategy recently announced a plan to raise $42 billion to purchase more Bitcoin, which he equates to acquiring every Bitcoin mined over the next three years at a price of $85,000 or more per coin. Saylor emphasized that this bold strategy reflects MicroStrategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin-focused investment thesis and demonstrates their confidence in the ongoing bullish market conditions. The conversation then turned to regulatory matters, particularly with regard to the new U.S. administration’s potential appointment of a new SEC Chair. Saylor highlighted that while Bitcoin is regulated as a commodity, other cryptocurrencies and crypto-related businesses, including MicroStrategy, fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. He noted that the appointment of a new SEC Chair is critical for shaping the future of digital assets regulation. Saylor expects the next SEC Chair to be more aligned with pro-Bitcoin and pro-business policies. He foresees a digital assets framework that would bring an end to what he described as a “war on crypto,” leading to more clarity in the regulatory landscape. He also mentioned that the broader political shift in the U.S., with the House, Senate, and White House all leaning towards pro-crypto policies, bodes well for the future of the industry. However, he refrained from speculating on specific names for the new SEC leadership. Addressing Bitcoin’s price movement, Saylor expressed confidence that the current rally is far from over. He dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could fall below key levels such as $60,000 or $30,000. Instead, he confidently stated that he expects Bitcoin to continue rising, with a potential to breach $100,000 before the end of the year. Saylor is already planning a celebratory event for when Bitcoin crosses this milestone, hinting at hosting a party on New Year’s Eve. When pressed on potential risks that could drive Bitcoin’s price lower, Saylor downplayed any significant threats. He indicated that the biggest uncertainty had already been resolved by the results of the November 5th elections. In his view, the political landscape is now settled, with strong support for digital assets from the newly elected officials. As a result, he sees no immediate risks that could derail Bitcoin’s current trajectory. The final topic of discussion revolved around the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, which has been proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. Saylor drew parallels between this initiative and historical acquisitions by the U.S., such as the purchase of Manhattan, the Louisiana Territory, California, and Alaska. He argued that just as these acquisitions expanded the U.S.’s influence in the physical world, acquiring Bitcoin would establish American dominance in cyberspace. Saylor views the concept of a Bitcoin reserve as a strategic move that would secure the United States’ control over the global financial system in the digital age. He argued that owning a significant portion of Bitcoin would enable the U.S. to maintain its position as a global economic leader. According to his calculations, adopting this strategy could potentially offset $16 trillion of the national debt, making it not only a strategic but also an economically sound decision.

(Bloomberg) -- The speculative frenzy around Bitcoin since Donald Trump’s US election victory is moderating both in the spot and derivatives markets. Most Read from Bloomberg Under Trump, Prepare for New US Transportation Priorities NYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January Zimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift The largest digital asset slid below $87,000 at one point on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said there was no need to hurry interest-rate cuts. The token later pared back some of its losses trading at $90,265 as of 12:11 p.m. in London. In the derivatives sector, K33 Research said the premium paid for CME-listed Bitcoin futures over the spot market price has declined. US-based institutional investors use the contracts to take positions on the original cryptocurrency. Figures from Amberdata indicate a 24-hour surge in open interest — or outstanding contracts — for bearish options with a strike price of $80,000. “Markets seems to be cooling down,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, adding that the narrowing of the futures premium “might have been a subtle hint of moderating risk profiles.” Trump’s Pledges Bitcoin has jumped about 30% since the US election on Nov. 5. in response to President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance. The digital asset is now viewed as one of a suite of so-called Trump trades, and speculators are wondering how much impetus the rally has left. Trump has pledged to create a friendly regulatory framework for crypto, set up a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and make the US the global hub for the industry. A onetime crypto skeptic, Trump changed tack after digital-asset firms spent heavily during election campaigning to promote their interests. Questions remain about the feasibility and implementation timeline of his promises. Investors poured a net $4.3 billion into US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds after Election Day. The 12 funds, from issuers including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, now have total assets of about $93 billion, based on figures compiled by Bloomberg. Volatility Expected “It’s all pure speculative trading right now,” said James Davies, chief executive officer at on-chain futures and options trading platform Crypto Valley Exchange. “Expect lots of volatility and a lack of clear signals for a while, whilst we wait for policy announcements in the US.” Davies flagged $90,000 as a key marker to watch to see if acts as a “resistance level, or if we are well past it.” One of the highest concentrations of bullish Bitcoin options bets is for the $100,000 strike, data from Deribit show. Bitcoin changed hands at $87,740 as of 6 a.m. Friday in London. Smaller tokens such as second-ranked Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin were mixed, in line with easing risk appetite as traders pared bets on Fed rate cuts following Powell’s comments. --With assistance from Dave Liedtka.

Title: Ireland v Argentina: Hosts must improve or fall prey to Pumas on a mission

A week can be a long time in rugby, and especially in November. Before Ireland’s opening Autumn Nations Series game against the All Blacks, there was almost blase expectations of another November clean sweep. Now, instead, that hope has been dashed and danger looms large over the horizon. After a first November home defeat since 2016, next up are Los Pumas, and the flip side of being the biggest gunslinger in town is that it makes you the most prized target. So, one imagines Felipe Contepomi had barely assembled his squad for their end-of-year tour than he had targeted a first ever Pumas win over Ireland in this ground. With Ireland in need of a win to avoid successive defeats for the first time since February 2021, there is more at stake than the Admiral Brown Cup, named after the Argentinian naval hero William (aka Guillermo) Brown, who was born in Foxford in Mayo in 1777. Contepomi loves Dublin and Ireland after leaving an indelible imprint in his eventful time with Leinster as a player and coach. He also had many great days against Ireland, not least in the 1999 and 2007 World Cups, as well as two home wins, but he lost against Ireland five times, including all four visits to Dublin. Whereas Argentina have beaten Les Bleus five times in France, England twice at Twickenham, and have won in Scotland four times and Wales three times, they have lost all 10 Tests in Dublin (11 including the 1973 visit). So, while much of the spite from the Noughties has gone from this rivalry and Los Pumas still have to play France in Paris next Friday, beating Ireland would be the cherry on top to a landmark year. Until 2016, when Ireland achieved the feat, only Martin Johnson’s vintage English team of 2003 had beaten the southern hemisphere big three in the same calendar year. Ireland repeated the feat in 2022 and now Los Pumas in 2024 can be added to that list. The return of Guido Petti, Pablo Matera and Matías Moroni, as well as of the gifted Santiago Carreras to the bench, is a statement of intent. Granted, performances have been inconsistent, but this is a very settled Pumas side. They beat Italy 50-18 in Udine last week. This is the same front-row that started their last five games. Tomas Albornoz has solved their outhalf conundrum, they’ve pace on the edges and the classy Juan Cruz Mallia is oozing confidence. They also have licence to, selectively, play from anywhere. Contepomi once started a contender for Leinster’s greatest ever try off turnover ball near his own line and last week Albornoz instigated and finished a pitch-length try in his 20-point haul. “He’s definitely gone back to their flair a little bit,” said Caelan Doris. “They’re playing with a lot more width. He [Contepomi] is a pretty creative guy. Some of the lineout plays that he came up with, with us [Leinster], were pretty inventive. He’s quite detail-orientated as well.” With Matera alongside Juan Martín González, a slightly younger version of Doris, and Joaquin Oviedo, their back row has a typical Pumas’ dynamism and their battle with Ireland’s loose forwards could be worth the admission money alone. “I’ve said to you guys before that I love playing against really good backrow players and tomorrow is another opportunity to do that,” said Doris after Ireland’s Captain’s Run in the UCD Bowl, where he remembers winning once with St Mary’s in the AIL. Doris is doing well to remember too, given his “debs” was later that night. “Oviedo at number eight has been class as well. He’s a bit of a balance between Matera and Gonzalez in that he’s got good footwork, he’s a good athlete and he’s also extremely powerful and has the ability to play at the line as well. “Gonzalez, I’m just struck watching him by his physicality, unbelievable pace and he pops up in wider channels quite a bit. Matera, I’ve played against him before and he has a lot of power, a lot of determination in his carry. A bit of a nuisance at the breakdown, all three of them are. I’m excited to test myself against them.” As for Andy Farrell, retaining all but one of his starting XV while reinvigorating the bench is a statement of faith, while promoting Ryan Baird alongside Peter O’Mahony on the bench increases Ireland’s lineout options. Improving discipline after Nic Berry’s costly 13-5 penalty count is paramount too. “I think nine of the 13 penalties were given away by forwards, and a lot of those were around the breakdown,” said Doris. “Yeah, cleaning our stuff up is the main thing.” Statistics and damned lies. Ireland have won 22 of their last 25 Tests, but they’ve lost three of their last five. The All Blacks took a leaf out of England’s and South Africa’s manual by having the majority of the possession, reducing Ireland’s oxygen from lineouts and the breakdown. Under Farrell, Ireland have achieved many landmarks by being a possession-based side. Generating quality lineout ball would infuse Ireland with a platform and confidence. The forecasted dryer conditions should help build more momentum through phases. Jamison Gibson-Park would then have the scope to probe the blindside as he does better than any “9″ and Jack Crowley would have more front-foot ball in more dangerous areas. Although an ever-present since the World Cup, the Munster outhalf is under pressure and looks a tad short in confidence, going through the moves but not trusting his instincts. But he’s still only 24. This is all part of his and the team’s renewed growth. Based on trust in this team, and just one week on, all that could change again.

[singing] everybody must carve stone... “Cheating...” Fair enough. But the same could probably have been said with the introduction of any new technology to the field. The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels. If a robot can chisel out a near-perfect replica of the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo’s David or Augustus of Prima Porta, I’d imagine that there’ll be a market for that sort of thing. all the time or just rainy days? You miss the point. Reproductions/replicas are not art, they are copies. There’s a robotic bumbershoot that helps with that. Perfect counterfeits, and if from same quarry, who can tell? You miss the point. I never said that such things weren’t copies. Are you saying if I take a picture of the mona lisa or do a step by step “paint by numbers” copy - that’s it’s different than creating the original work of art? “The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels.” True... but at least he had to sculpt. He couldn’t go into town for a sandwich and let the power tools do it all. Of course, there can be human creativity in designing what the robotic arm chisels out. That’s not to say that AI-created designs wouldn’t also be possible. If they can do Michaelangelo, they can do McDonalds - let’s keep raising that minimum wage! Really, robot sculpting isn't much different than music replication. Before Edison invented recording technology, average musicians could make a reasonable living playing live in their home towns. Now they are relegated to providing music lessons to the bratty children of the rich, for an hourly minimum wage, while a very few lucky musicians of equal talent make millions of dollars every year through the fickle finger of fate, even after their death. >the fickle finger of fate, And the star-making machinery behind the popular song. Probably more so that. This could actually be a good thing. Instead of relying upon modern art to decorate public spaces/buildings... classical art forms could be utilized. Rather than being channeled into what artists want (and the dismal art they currently produce), robots could open the market to what society wants.

Title: Microsoft UAE power deal at centre of US plan for AI supremacy
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366615892/Microsoft-UAE-power-deal-at-centre-of-US-plan-for-AI-supremacy
Time Published: 2024-11-15T05:08:00Z
Full Content:
VLRS - stock.adobe.com Microsoft has struck an artificial intelligence (AI) energy deal with United Arab Emirates (UAE) oil giant ADNOC after a year of extraordinary diplomacy in which it was the vehicle for a US strategy to prevent a Chinese military tech grab in the Gulf region. The latest in a line of AI deals that Microsoft has struck in the UAE this year, it is the fruit of a strategic partnership the US struck with the Gulf state in September to entwine the UAE with US strategic interests and technology, after it started investing its oil wealth in a plan to become an AI superpower. It also entrenches Microsoft’s place at the crux of the environmental crisis, pledging to help one of the world’s largest oil firms use AI to become a net-zero producer of carbon emissions, while getting help in return in building renewable energy sources to feed the unprecedented demand that the datacentres powering its AI services have for electricity. The same paradox was played out at the COP 28 climate conference in Dubai last December, while Microsoft prepared to ink a $1.5bn investment in UAE state-owned AI and datacentre conglomerate G42, where Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, ADNOC oil chief, chaired a global agreement to ditch fossil fuels. But the agreement raises a question of why Microsoft needs the partnership to explore the potential for renewables to power AI, when a considerable proportion of electricity required to run the power-hungry computers in the world’s datacentres already comes from renewable sources. This came after massive investments by US big tech firms, and when a third party in the deal is Masdar, the renewables arm of a UEA sovereign wealth fund, set up to invest the state’s oil wealth in renewables. This helped the Gulf state attain a similar place in the world’s top 10 rankings for solar power output as it has in oil production. Masdar’s investments include the UK’s Dogger Bank wind farm, set to become the world’s largest. It is a crucial question for UAE, which has established its credentials in making some of the most notable breakthroughs in AI tech in recent years. This includes the Falcon large language model, which is compared for its acumen with well-known AI engines operated by US big tech firms, and is the world’s first Arabic AI model. The petrostate seeks to be a world leader in AI, while the global energy transition strips it of the oil and gas wealth upon which its economy was until recently almost entirely dependent. Al Jaber, who is also UAE industry minister, characterised these last weeks as a crisis, worsened by an anticipated population surge across the southern hemisphere, and by the unexpected and exponential growth in demand for power from datacentres housing AI computer systems. It is a crucial matter for UAE because the weather in the Middle East is so hot that it takes 50% more energy to cool a datacentre there than in the cooler northern reaches where most datacentres operate, according to Tassos Peppas, regional director of Vertiv, a supplier of datacentre power and cooling systems crucial for running the prized Nvidia computer chips crucial for the big AI systems. “The Middle East is not the best place for energy efficiency,” he said. No matter that energy in the Gulf was typically 90% cheaper than Europe, and that the same datacentre, on balance, would cost up to 80% less than one in Europe. Unanticipated until 18 months ago, the UAE has now called for a boost in all forms of cleaner energy, including the liquid natural gas to which the country has turned to as a less-polluting fossil fuel export than the oil, which is still a primary source of power across those countries where populations are booming and economies are industrialising fast, Al Jaber told a global conference of oil and energy chiefs, and state officials from across the southern hemisphere. Those countries, across Africa, Southeast and Central Asia, and the Asian subcontinent, where UAE has a long tradition of trade, have become a destination for Emirate investments in AI, energy and port infrastructure. The firms Microsoft has been doing business with have all been spreading their influence by making such AI investments across the wider region. Microsoft itself did a $1bn AI deal with the UAE in Kenya in May. That explains both Microsoft and US motives in the Gulf state, as UAE AI minister Omar Sultan Al Olama put it in an interview with US think tank Atlantic Council when the software giant took its massive stake in G42 in in April. UAE is a “gateway” to Africa, Southeast Asia and India. He likened great power competition in AI, and international negotiations over AI regulation such as the UK’s own Bletchley Park summit, to the Cold War nuclear arms race. “UAE is the perfect hub where the US can showcase its technology for the rest of the developing world in a way that asserts its supremacy in this domain,” he said. UAE’s Falcon AI was a vehicle the US could use to assert that supremacy, because it was known and trusted in Africa, for example, while Falcon would benefit from getting access to advanced US AI technology. That trade-off came at the expense last year of G42 purging its systems and datacentres of Chinese technology, paving the way for a strategic deal with the US two months ago, and a series of tie-ups. These included a $100bn investment fund that Microsoft formed with US financial giants BlackRock and Global Infrastructure Partners, and UAE state-owned AI investor MGX. Microsoft president Brad Smith joined UN environment envoy Mark Carney and the CEOs of most major oil firms to agree on the eve of the energy conference that the crisis was so great that it would need gas, as well as nuclear and renewables, to solve it. The software giant’s latest contribution will be the AI engine for a UAE effort to make its fossil gas exports more competitive, as well as its energy system greener. Microsoft will help run a national infrastructure of energy grid battery plants UAE needs to store output from what it claims is the world’s largest solar farm, as it completes construction in the next five years. Al Jaber, sitting on the boards of most of the firms involved, as well as running the industry ministry, and Microsoft’s Smith, will be at the centre of it all.

Hadron lets users tokenize various assets, from stocks and bonds to stablecoins and loyalty points, Tether said Thursday in a statement. The platform also offers tools for issuing and managing the full life cycle of digital tokenized assets, with the aim of facilitating the process of tokenizing assets for both individual and institutional investors, according to the company. Real-world asset tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights of physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. The tokens represent fractional or full ownership of the asset, allowing it to be bought, sold, or traded more easily in digital markets while providing increased liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. “Traditional finance institutions have always pushed for closed ecosystems that are opaque to citizens,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in the statement. “By leveraging all of Tether’s technology—which today has already secured 125 billion dollars—we’re making asset tokenization easier, secure, and scalable.” Hadron supports tokenizing digital securities such as equities, bonds, and funds; fiat-pegged and commodity-backed stablecoins; and Alloy by Tethered Assets assets. Tethered Assets are designed to track a reference asset’s price "through stabilization strategies," including over-collateralization with "liquid assets and secondary market liquidity pools," per Tether's website. The company also plans to offer tokenization for digital asset-collateralized tokens, including basket-collateralized products. Currently serving several institutions in beta, the platform's team is also in discussions to work with several developing nation-states, a Tether representative told Decrypt. The Tether-linked platform operates with asset issuance and burning and capital market management, in addition to abiding by Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines and other regulatory requirements, the company said in a statement. Hadron’s launch comes amid a surge in real-world asset tokenization. RWA's total value locked stands at $6.591 billion, which is up roughly 12% since the same time last year, DeFiLlama data shows. Hadron is just one of several crypto-native players attempting to get a piece of the RWA pie. In early October, Midas launched two tokenized investment products based on mTBill and mBasis, respectively. Meanwhile, Elmnts, a tokenized investment platform for funds backed by mineral rights royalties, launched on Solana later that month. DeFi protocol Ondo also started leveraging the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) tokenized money market fund for its derivative products earlier this year.

Title: Elon Musk stirs Crypto buzz with surprising Dogecoin remarks as Bitcoin eyes new heights

Editions: En/lifestyle/us-news/personal-finance Musk took to his social media platform to voice his opinion on the recent surges Elon Musk, well-known for his influential voice in the tech and crypto world, has again sparked interest by revisiting his stance on digital currencies. This latest move comes during a remarkable surge in the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin surging past $90,000 and drawing attention with its rapid ascent. The market's sharp rise follows the recent U.S. presidential election outcome, where Donald Trump secured victory, adding further anticipation for potential policy changes favorable to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, riding a wave of optimism, has climbed 20% in just a week, pushing the combined crypto market back over the $3 trillion mark for the first time since 2021. Meanwhile, dogecoin, a cryptocurrency Musk has historically backed, has also rallied to levels reminiscent of the 2021 crypto boom. In an unexpected twist, Musk voiced his support for dogecoin's inflationary design. Responding to Billy Markus, dogecoin's co-creator, who engaged the community on the topic, Musk affirmed his belief in the system. "I think the flat inflation of dogecoin, which means decreasing percentage inflation, is a feature, not a bug," Musk noted on X, reigniting interest in the meme-based currency. Dogecoin, originally forked from bitcoin's code, stands out for its limitless supply, differing from bitcoin's cap of 21 million coins. This characteristic has long sparked debate, with some advocating for inflation as a tool for usability and circulation. Markus reinforced this view, pointing out that the currency's steady, predictable inflation is lower than that of the dollar, emphasizing its potential for real-world currency use. Musk's comments come amid heightened speculation that BlackRock is preparing to double down on bitcoin investments, signaling a potential shift in how major financial institutions engage with cryptocurrencies. Tesla and SpaceX, Musk's prominent ventures, already accept dogecoin for certain transactions, showcasing Musk's continued commitment to the meme-driven currency. This public endorsement, however, has not been without challenges. Musk faced legal battles when his past crypto endorsements led to accusations of market manipulation. Earlier this year, a judge dismissed a high-profile lawsuit accusing Musk and Tesla of artificially inflating the value of dogecoin in a so-called $258 billion "pyramid scheme." The market surge follows Trump's administration hinting at significant changes to crypto regulations, with experts forecasting more lenient approaches and potential leadership shifts at regulatory bodies known for their cautious stance on digital assets. Adding fuel to the speculative fire, Trump has floated the idea of a U.S. bitcoin reserve, drawing comparisons to gold and suggesting bitcoin could be an asset to address the country's colossal debt. As the U.S. gears up for a potential shift in crypto policy and the market adjusts to the latest developments, all eyes remain on key players like Musk, whose words can sway billions in market value, and on the administration that could pave the way for the future of digital currency in the global financial system. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Title: An OpenAI Push for ‘Digital Enterprise Zones’ May Supercharge US AI Development, Analysts Say
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/an-openai-push-for-digital-enterprise-zones-may-supercharge-us-ai-development-analysts-say/

OpenAI’s reported proposal for special economic districts across America could unleash billions in private investment and dramatically accelerate domestic tech infrastructure, marking Silicon Valley’s boldest push yet to reshape how artificial intelligence (AI) technology gets built, analysts say. The proposal would establish government-backed zones offering streamlined permitting for data centers and chip plants while providing tax incentives to AI companies. It’s a part of OpenAI’s strategy to accelerate America’s AI capabilities amid intensifying global competition for technological dominance. “With dedicated zones, companies would likely choose locations based on these areas’ infrastructure, regulatory flexibility, and AI-focused incentives and resources,” Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at stock brokerage Freedom24, told PYMNTS. “To attract companies, these AI economic zones might have to offer incentives like tax breaks, grants or funding. Such incentives could help offset initial costs, making it more appealing for companies to grow their roots in those areas.” OpenAI’s proposal for special economic districts could impact commerce by channeling billions of private investments into AI infrastructure and attracting tech companies with generous incentives. Analysts suggest this move could accelerate innovation, reshaping the landscape for data centers, chip plants, and AI-driven businesses across the U.S. According to FedScoop, OpenAI plans to present a policy blueprint advocating for AI economic zones across the U.S. through state and federal collaboration. The proposal, set to be unveiled in Washington, outlines plans to streamline the construction of energy systems and data centers powering AI development. The blueprint reportedly calls for a National Transmission Highway Act targeting power transmission and fiber networks while proposing a North American AI compact to compete with China. The initiative, which emerges as the Biden administration pushes for increased AI infrastructure support, includes recommendations for leveraging Navy nuclear resources and developing the workforce for AI-related operations. Recent proposals in the U.S. to boost AI development include the Biden administration’s $140 million investment to establish National AI Research Institutes to promote responsible AI research. In addition, Microsoft has partnered with BlackRock to build AI-specific data centers that use advanced energy infrastructure, addressing the need for sustainable power to fuel AI advancements. The CHIPS and Science Act also includes provisions to enhance domestic semiconductor manufacturing, a critical component for AI development. Additionally, Nvidia and ServiceNow announced plans to collaborate on developing generative AI tools, illustrating private-sector initiatives to advance AI. “AI-empowered free zones would most certainly attract tech firms and startups, resulting in firms’ relocation decisions in these zones for the benefit of both resources and community,” Cache Merrill, founder of Zibtek and technology strategist, told PYMNTS. “This regional emphasis could provide for additional scattering of tech clusters in the U.S., reducing dependence on the already established tech centers and in all likelihood, creating opportunities in new cities in the suburbs.” Merrill said financial incentives in these zones may include reduced taxes, lowered compliance costs, and assistance in investing in AI R&D. He added that the plan would support workforce development programs to incentivize companies to invest in local talent training. This would benefit regional economies and create a skilled workforce pipeline for AI operations. “Another benefit of the economic zones of AI is that they could promote private firms and large public universities to work together for R&D purposes,” Merrill said. “These collaborations would be very effective in AI technology transfer, because universities are the foremost providers of basic science, while business firms are the best providers of AI applications. Such zones may facilitate collaboration on joint research laboratories, joint funding of practicum, and joint transnational corporation projects on technology acquisition.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Fiat Everything: When Decree Replaced Reality

November 14, 2024 By Josh Stylman We live in a world where every essential human need—money, food, health, education, and even information—is controlled and manipulated by artificial systems. This matrix of artifice began with central bankers creating fiat currency: declaring something’s value, enforcing its use, and creating dependency. This template manufactured scarcity where none naturally exists, ensuring reliance on their systems. We see this pattern everywhere: money created from nothing yet always in short supply, abundant food made artificially scarce, natural healing rebranded as ‘alternative,’ wisdom replaced by credentials. The Federal Reserve conjures currency through debt monetization, each new dollar stealing value from every existing one. Through inflation, they silently rob almost all of your savings, turning your productive energy into their power. In 1913, a solid month’s work could buy a fine suit. Today it barely covers a week’s groceries. The labor didn’t change—the money did. Fiat currency itself is a kind of enforced dependency. Since the gold standard was abandoned in 1971, there has been no limit on their monetary manipulation. This isn’t just about currency—it’s about energy harvesting. Banks create money through keystrokes, then demand repayment in real human time and labor. When the Fed printed $6 trillion in 2020, they didn’t create value—they diluted every dollar in your savings account. It’s modern financial alchemy: transforming your productivity into their power. As Brownstone’s Jeffrey Tucker aptly puts it, ‘The Federal Reserve is the engine of one of the most sophisticated forms of theft in the history of mankind.’ As central banks race to implement Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), promising convenience while building the architecture for total financial surveillance, the endgame becomes clear. Hard money—constrained by natural or mathematical limits—can’t be summoned into existence. Gold and silver face physical extraction constraints. Bitcoin is hard-capped at 21 million coins. Land cannot be added to the map. Even these aren’t perfect, but they share one critical feature: they cannot be created like monopoly money by central planners. These limitations mean true value is earned, not fabricated, which is why they’re attacked—they can’t be inflated away. Just as the financial system shapes our economic reality through artificial scarcity, the information landscape engineers our perception through concentrated control. Six corporations control 90% of media outlets, down from 50 companies in 1983. Further exacerbating this consolidation, it’s not about false stories—it’s about manufacturing false reality and engineering social division. Fiat currency has created a fiat news system, where the same principles apply: declare something, repeat it, enforce it, and it enters the consciousness of the masses. The illusion of media choice masks concentrated ownership: BlackRock and Vanguard are top shareholders in every major media company (incidentally, they own the major banks too). The same firms own shares in defense contractors, pharmaceutical companies, and the very corporations making headlines. As former CBS News president Richard Salant admitted, “Our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have.” By slicing society into endless opposing camps—left vs right, black vs white, vaxxed vs unvaxxed—they ensure people keep fighting each other instead of looking up to see who’s pulling the strings. This isn’t simply about silencing dissent but shaping belief. Remember how quickly “Trust the science” became “Don’t question authority”? How “Two weeks to flatten the curve” became two years of shifting goalposts? Even the most trusting citizens began noticing the narrative management. The Information Factory doesn’t just control what you see—it shapes how you think about what you see. Content curation algorithms create echo chambers while coordinated messaging manufactures the illusion of consensus. Media outlets are owned by corporations dependent on government contracts and regulated by the agencies they report on. When you follow the money—from pharmaceutical ads to defense contractor ownership—you see that they’re not reporting on the system; they are the system. The manipulation of information serves as a precursor to perhaps the most devastating expression of centralized power—the machinery of endless war. War is the ultimate racket, and bankers have perfected it since the Napoleonic Wars. Create the conflict, fund all participants, profit from the destruction, and then finance the reconstruction. The same financial interests collect blood money regardless of who “wins.” The military-industrial complex needs endless enemies to justify endless spending. When one boogeyman falls, they manufacture another. They don’t sell weapons—they sell fear. Each missile launched represents schools not built, hospitals not funded, communities not supported. The people always pay, while bankers collect the dividends. They call it “foreign policy”—it’s really population control and resource theft. They destroy independent nations that dare create their own money systems or trade outside their control while calling it “spreading democracy.” Young people die in foreign lands while suit-wearing vultures redraw maps around oil fields and trade routes. Look at Ukraine: BlackRock is already planning the “reconstruction,” buying up land and resources while people die. While physical warfare destroys bodies, the credentialing system wages a quieter battle for minds, determining who can speak with authority and what truths are deemed acceptable. We’ve created a class of experts who mistake institutional approval for wisdom. The average medical student graduates with $241,600 in debt—how likely are they to challenge a system they’re indebted to? Fiat education produces fiat expertise, reliant on institutional validation instead of true understanding. Studies show that medical education frequently emphasizes pharmaceutical interventions, while lifestyle and dietary approaches receive comparatively little attention. When PhDs questioned lockdown policies, they were silenced while social media companies became overnight “public health experts. The student loan crisis reveals the scam: $1.7 trillion in debt while real wages for graduates have stagnated. Real expertise comes from results, not degrees. A farmer who grows nutrient-dense food understands health better than many nutritionists. A mechanic who fixes engines grasps complex systems better than many economists. Theory without practice is just sophisticated guessing. Their degrees don’t measure intelligence—they measure obedience. The longer you stay in their system, the harder it becomes to see beyond it. The same institutional capture that turns education into indoctrination extends into healthcare, where healing wisdom is replaced by patented interventions. They’ve transformed medicine from healing art to subscription service. Purdue Pharma made $35 billion selling OxyContin while calling addiction “pseudoaddiction” requiring higher doses. The FDA approves synthetic THC while natural plants are federally illegal, despite legalization in some states. The difference? One can be patented. Here again, fiat principles: replace the natural with the engineered, at a steep price. The corruption is measurable: The pharmaceutical industry has faced substantial financial penalties over the past two decades due to various legal violations. Among the most significant cases are: These same companies now claim exclusive authority over human health, hooking children on SSRIs instead of teaching them to process emotions naturally. Natural healing—through sunlight, clean food, movement, and rest—gets labeled “alternative” while synthetic drugs become standard care. Your body’s innate healing power becomes suspect while their patented molecules become essential. Our bodies know how to recover when we remove the obstacles. The medicalization of health represents just one front in a broader war against natural systems—one that extends to our most basic needs for nourishment. Look at their war on our most nutrient-dense traditional foods: They demonize meat and butter—the very foods that built our brains and sustained humanity for millennia. Dr. Weston Price’s extensive research of indigenous populations in the 1930s documented zero instances of modern chronic diseases among groups eating their traditional diets, finding rates of dental caries less than 1% and virtually no heart disease. Yet they push processed soy patties and lab-grown protein while attacking regenerative grazing that could heal our planet. Raw milk, nature’s perfect food, becomes “dangerous” the moment it leaves the cow. Despite regulatory opposition, demand has surged, with buying clubs and small farmers facing scrutiny and even armed raids for selling fresh milk. This once-simple food choice has turned political, embraced by those questioning government authority, while ultra-processed ‘milk alternatives’ made from water and seed oils flood supermarket shelves. Even the sun, the source of all life on Earth, has been turned into an enemy. Instead of teaching proper sun exposure for optimal vitamin D, they push chemical sunscreens that disrupt hormones and poison coral reefs. As our connection to natural systems is severed, we’re ushered into an artificial realm that promises connection while delivering isolation. The path to our current isolation was carefully engineered. First, they separated us physically—”Just stay 6 feet apart.” Then they confined us—”Just stay home.” Finally, they sold us the ultimate fiat substitute: the metaverse—where digital avatars replace human touch. Ironically, as social connection grows artificial, real human presence becomes rarer. As someone who spent two decades as a technologist, I know these tools are powerful and should be universally accessible to all. The issue isn’t technology itself—it’s whether it’s deployed to centralize or decentralize power. Like electricity, which can power a community or an electric fence, digital tools can either connect and empower people or surveil and control them. The question isn’t the technology—it’s who controls it and how it’s used. We’ve become alone together—constantly surrounded yet deeply alone. Meta’s own research shows Instagram makes body image issues worse for 32% of teen girls. Average screen time has skyrocketed to over 7 hours daily in 2023, while rates of depression doubled. We broadcast our lives to strangers while avoiding eye contact with neighbors. We share our deepest thoughts with algorithms while struggling to have real conversations. We’re drowning in communication while starving for communion. Yes, virtual worlds can be fun escapes—there’s joy in games and digital play. But the metaverse isn’t just entertainment—it’s an attempt to replace reality itself with an artificial construct they control. A thousand TikTok friends can’t replace one real conversation. A million likes can’t substitute for one genuine hug. We’re bioelectric beings who literally resonate with each other. Human proximity affects our: They fear real human connection because it breaks their control matrix. When people gather, share stories, and exchange energy, the programming breaks down. The implementation starts locally: If you live in an urban area, join or start a food-buying club. If you have access to farmers, buy directly from them. Create a neighborhood skill-sharing network where people teach what they know—from food preservation to basic repair skills. Start a community garden or join an existing CSA. Build relationships with like-minded neighbors. Each small step builds resilience and weakens dependency on artificial systems. The beautiful truth is that every artificial system has a natural counterpart that sets us free. Artificial systems rely on your participation, belief, and, ultimately, obedience. Their money only has value if we believe in it. Their authority only has power if we accept it. Their narratives only work if we consume them. The solution isn’t complex: No one returns to fiat systems once they’ve experienced the real thing. You don’t go back to processed food after tasting nature’s abundance. You don’t trust fiat currency once you understand sound money. You don’t accept artificial authority once you’ve found your own sovereignty. The revolution isn’t coming—it’s here. Every garden is a rebellion against their food system. Every bitcoin is a rebellion against their money system. Every real conversation is a rebellion against their control system. Every home cook is a rebellion against their processed food empire. Every parent teaching real history is a rebellion against their education system. Every local market is a rebellion against their corporate monopolies. Every neighborhood gathering is a rebellion against their isolation agenda. Our ancestors thrived without fiat systems. Our descendants will view this artificial era as a dark age of manufactured limitation. The transition back to natural law isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable. Truth doesn’t need enforcement. Reality doesn’t need decree. Your DNA remembers what your mind was programmed to forget. Freedom isn’t granted by authority—it’s your natural state. What real thing will you choose today?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves. Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some "very good" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force. READ ALSO: 10 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and 15 AI News That Broke The Internet Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period. With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology. Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.” As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: World of Warcraft's in-game anniversary event could've been a joyous celebration of the last 20 years, but instead it's a disappointing grind

Full Content:
The anniversary event is full of sound and fury, thus far signifying no thing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The 20th anniversary of World of Warcraft deserves an epic event: a celebration of the world's most successful MMO, one that has transcended generations. Instead, it's a jumbled mess of nostalgia with no clear throughline and a grind to earn anything fun. Let me start by announcing my bias: I adore Warcraft. I've been writing about it since six months before the game's release, and despite its many flaws, I've largely stuck with it nearly continuously since then. I was absolutely looking forward to the celebration of the anniversary, certain that truly legendary gameplay was in store. Instead, what I got was a mishmash of unrelated celebration, connected only by a grind that locks away any interesting items. Most of the rewards for the event—some really nice high-resolution retro cosmetic armor sets, toys, weapons, and pets—are earned by collecting frustratingly scarce Bronze Celebration Tokens, which are available to some degree by playing other activities in the game and partially from anniversary events themselves. We've had Timewalking dungeons and raids before, even without an anniversary event. Blizzard massively buffed the amount of tokens that drop after the celebration had been out only a week, but it still feels like it's not enough; particularly because the anniversary events themselves are a bit of a yawn. One of the easiest ways to complete a weekly quest for tokens, for example, involves turning yourself into your pet, jumping into a basket… and sitting there for a full minute while a counter slowly ticks up. Various iconic raid bosses are now dotted about the landscape, waiting patiently to be killed by groups that rarely come. You can show off your transmog armor sets or your mount collection, turn into your favorite raid boss or your favorite pet, and watch (and participate in) the reenactment of crucial events from the game. The biggest new offerings feel like an extension of previous Timewalking events: a new raid, based on the overly-long Blackrock Depths dungeon from vanilla WoW; and new scaled-up vanilla Timewalking dungeons, including Deadmines and Dire Maul. These are fun because they're new, if initially over-tuned. The raid in particular has required a series of nerfs to be playable by random groups. (A group from my Mythic raid-clearing guild struggled with the later bosses of Heroic difficulty BRD when it first launched.) But even those instances don't feel overly special, because we've had Timewalking dungeons and raids before, even without an anniversary event. The Korrak's Revenge PvP event is a returning feature, and the stalls and vendors at the anniversary area in Tanaris are fairly similar to the stalls and vendors from previous anniversary events—which weren't as dramatic as this one should be. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I love transmog. I love pets and mounts and toys. I ground through every level of the PvP Plunderstorm event last spring—even though I despise fighting other players—to get those cosmetic rewards. I played Pandaria Remix until I had fully leveled a dozen new alts just to buy every available mount, appearance, and toy. I should be all over this event trying to earn everything, and yet it's been a struggle just to play through it all to write this piece. It's not the rewards—they're lovely. Tier 2 was a glorious era for Warcraft raid armor, and the high resolution versions are very pretty. I want them all. The meta-achievement blue phoenix for the event, while nothing like the iconic Ashes of A'lar mount Blizzard shamelessly compares it to, is still beautiful. (It's not the skeleton, my artist friends, that makes players love the Ashes, it's those wildly over-the-top glittery streamers as you fly.) The new armor appearances modeled after Blizzard employee rewards are a nice touch, rewarding players in a similar way for loyalty, and they’re attractive to boot. Did it have to feel this way? Absolutely not. But every single one of them requires a grind. In previous anniversaries, I got something just for logging in. This year, there were no free items. Even the typical reputation and experience buff requires a quest to unlock every few days, albeit an easy one. Token rewards drop eight at a time from significant weekly activities, but you need 60 to buy your first armor set. The cost lowers over time, but you don't get any for free. It would be like telling a Blizzard employee they get that cool sword or shield as a loyalty reward—but only if they put in 60 hours of overtime. Will I grind all those nifty appearances and rewards at some point before the event expires on January 6? Yes, begrudingly. Partially by doing content I don't care for, and partially by picking my way through the jumbled smorgasbord of activities that are fun but meaningless in combination. Did it have to feel this way? Absolutely not. Mindlessly grinding for currency is one of the least enjoyable aspects of Warcraft, and it's part of what brings down these anniversary events. The lack of any real incentive to do any particular event, since they all offer largely interchangeable rewards of that currency, doesn't help. (I am not the only person to feel this way.) The meta-achievement that rewards the Coldflame Tempest phoenix mount is a step in the right direction. It at least asks you to try everything out, which is a good reason to do everything once. But what if the entire event had been structured that way? What if the event was just a series of 20 achievements (or 30, if you wanted to represent the 30-year anniversary of the Warcraft universe)? Each achievement could bestow one of the nifty rewards, and lead to the next. You could even take the additional step of adding story quests for each. If it were more linear, it could feel like a grand adventure, from start to finish, a combination of battle and exploration and dungeoneering and showing off, instead of all of those things thrown into a messy catch-all basket with a ‘for sale for 60 tokens’ sign thrown on top. I'm honestly fine with having to grind for the other armor sets for other classes, but the first one should be my reward for participating, not grinding.Perhaps the game could even give me a terrific, engrossing story to go with my achievements too. Clearly, there were writers involved in this project; getting them together as a team and making this a real questline would have gone a long way toward hyping up this event. What about an epic achievement-wrapping mini-film from Blizzard's terrific cinematics team? It's insulting when the trailer announcing the 30th anniversary Warcraft Direct broadcast or the announcement of the 15th anniversary and the release of Warcraft Classic feel more inspiring than your 20th anniversary celebration. The most promising part of the entire event is another not-new feature: a secret-finding exploration (similar to the Secrets of Azeroth event in Dragonflight), which is still underway. There are precious few new rewards from this series if you did the last one. But at least one heart-tugging appearance of an old character has occurred thus far, and I have hopes for more.The celebration is hardly over. But so far, the 20th anniversary event has sadly been reduced to just another grind. World of Warcraft might not have invented the wheel, but it certainly made it popular—and 20 years on, the MMO titan has fundamentally changed gaming's DNA After 'regrets and lessons learned,' and 2 months of tuning, Blizzard is 'happy' with Delves as WoW's newest endgame destination It's not quite the end-of-generation sale price I've been holding out for but an RTX 4070 for a penny under $500 isn't too bad PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Share this article Franklin Templeton expanded trading of its OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) to the Ethereum blockchain, adding to its multi-chain presence in the tokenized asset space. The $410 million fund, which launched in 2021 as the first money market fund to use public blockchain for tracking transactions and ownership, now ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) leads with $545 million, followed by Ondo’s U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) at $452 million. The asset manager has been actively expanding the fund’s blockchain support, recently adding Coinbase’s Base, Aptos, and Avalanche networks, while maintaining Stellar as its primary public blockchain. BlackRock also expanded its BUIDL fund yesterday to include blockchain networks such as Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet and Polygon. Ethereum currently dominates the tokenized treasury market with $1.6 billion in assets, positioning itself ahead of Stellar (XLM) and Solana (SOL). Currently, approximately 71% of tokenized Treasury fund assets under management (AUM) are on Ethereum, followed by 17% on Stellar and 5.8% on Solana, according to data by rwa.xyz. The remaining funds are distributed across smaller networks, including Arbitrum, Noble, Optimism, Mantle, Aptos, Sui, and Base. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

New BusConnects services which were due to come into effect in December have been deferred until January, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has announced. The NTA said introducing the changes in the run up to Christmas may have caused confusion among bus passengers. They were originally planned to be implemented on December 8th. The routes affected include two 24-hour, cross-city “spine” routes E1 and E2. These routes are to areas including Bray, Dublin city centre, Ballymun and Santry. Radial 19, a route running between Dublin Airport, DCU and Parnell Square is also affected, as are routes X1 and X2 from Kilcoole, Co Wicklow, to the city centre, and Newcastle, Co Wicklow, to the city centre respectively. A series of L routes serving Bray, north Wicklow and South Dublin are also affected: Together the routes form Phase 6A of the wider BusConnects project. The exact revised implementation date for Phase 6A in January has yet to be announced. A spokesman for the NTA said “we believe that the short-term disruption that the changes would involve for some customers would be an unwelcome complication in the run-up to Christmas”. “The rescheduling of Phase 6A will free up resources, allowing additional bus services, including additional night services, to operate over the Christmas period. “This will contribute to the city centre promotional campaign planned by Dublin City Council and businesses, and will support the retail and hospitality sector in the city and suburbs during the busy December period.” Tim O'Brien is an Irish Times journalist © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust Sees Explosive $3 Billion Inflows Amid BTC Surge

The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has seen over $3 billion of inflows over the past five days. According to data from Farside Investors, on November 7 BlackRock’s fund saw $1.119 billion inflows, while on the following day its inflows topped the $206 million mark. At the start of this week, the fund saw $756.5 million coming in, while on November 12 it brought in $778.3 million. On November 13, IBIT saw $230.8 million inflows. In total, the fund saw over $3 billion inflows, at a time in which cryptocurrency prices were surging. Over the past week, BTC’s rise rose 21.1% to now trade at $90,700, down from a new all-time high around $93,000. As CryptoGlobe reported, the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States earlier this year have seen their total assets cross the $90 billion mark after seeing a $6 billion ump in a single day, and are now over three-thirds of the way of surpassing gold ETFs in assets. That’s according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) pointed out that spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $6 billion jump in a day came with $1 billion of inflows, and $5 billion of market appreciation amid a significant BTC price rise. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Bitcoin ETFs’ total cumulative flow is at $28.3 billion. Notably, cryptocurrency investment products have also been seeing significant inflows, bringing in $1.98 billion in the week after Republican candidate Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. According to CoinShares latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the inflows couple with the cryptocurrency market rally have pushed the total assets under management of crypto investment products to a $116 billion high. The report details that Bitcoin-focused investment products saw $1.79 billion inflows over the past week, while Ethereum-focused products saw $157 million inflows. Featured image via Pexels.

Title: BlackRock Expanding Tokenized Fund BUIDL to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet, and Polygon
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/blackrock-expanding-tokenized-fund-buidl-to-aptos-arbitrum-avalanche-optimisms-op-mainnet-and-polygon/

Full Content:
BlackRock announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its tokenized liquidity fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to operate on multiple blockchain platforms. According to the press release, the fund, originally launched on Ethereum in March 2024 and tokenized through Securitize, will now extend to new share classes on Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet, and Polygon. This strategic expansion, as BlackRock and Securitize claim, is part of an ongoing push to enhance tokenization in the financial sector. By integrating with these blockchain networks, BUIDL reportedly aims to offer improved interoperability, enabling applications and users to interact with the fund more efficiently. The fund is expected to provide users with on-chain yield opportunities, real-time peer-to-peer transfers, flexible custody options, and the ability to accrue and distribute dividends on-chain. The firms involved highlight that BUIDL has already reached a significant milestone, becoming the largest tokenized fund by assets under management (AUM) within 40 days of its initial launch. BlackRock asserts that expanding the fund’s presence across multiple blockchains will offer increased flexibility and access for various market participants, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and firms native to the digital asset sector. The goal, according to the release, is to allow developers to leverage the fund within their preferred blockchain environments. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, stated that this move aligns with the company’s vision of building a robust, blockchain-native financial ecosystem. He noted that real-world asset tokenization is scaling up and that the addition of new blockchains could potentially enhance the capabilities of the BUIDL ecosystem. Domingo believes this expansion could drive further interest from investors looking to utilize blockchain technology for increased efficiency. BNY Mellon is mentioned as playing a role in facilitating this cross-chain integration. Acting as the fund administrator and custodian, BNY reportedly helped BUIDL go live on these additional blockchain platforms. Each blockchain network will host a distinct share class of the BUIDL fund with specific management fees. For instance: The new blockchains are intended to enhance the interoperability of BUIDL, potentially opening up new avenues for integration with various decentralized applications. Investors are cautioned that the fund carries various risks associated with blockchain investments, including regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. BlackRock emphasizes that BUIDL is designed for qualified investors with a high tolerance for risk, given that it operates under exemptions from U.S. securities registration requirements. The minimum investment threshold for BUIDL is set at $5 million, targeting institutional clients rather than retail investors.

Title: BlackRock Expands Crypto Reach: BUIDL Fund Goes Multi-Chain Across These 5 Blockchainsc

Crypto ETF issuer and asset manager BlackRock announced on Wednesday the expansion of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to include five new blockchain ecosystems: Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. Initially launched on the Ethereum network in March 2024, BUIDL rapidly gained traction among investors, becoming the largest tokenized fund globally regarding assets under management (AUM) within just 40 days. The expansion will allow BUIDL to interact with more blockchain-based financial products and infrastructures. BlackRock aims to enhance accessibility for investors, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital asset firms, enabling them to leverage BUIDL within the ecosystems of their choice. Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, the firm responsible for tokenizing BUIDL, emphasized the importance of this multi-chain approach in Wednesday’s press release by saying: Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do. With the addition of these blockchains, BlackRock aims to provide increased options and access for investors, allowing developers to build applications that integrate seamlessly with the BUIDL fund. BNY Mellon, which recently received a Bitcoin and crypto custody license for institutional services, will play a key role in this initiative as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL. On the crypto ETF front, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has reached a remarkable milestone, surpassing the $40 billion mark in assets under management (AUM) just two weeks after hitting $30 billion. This achievement comes in a record 211 days, shattering the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG). IBIT is now positioned in the top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at just 10 months old, it has outperformed all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, according to ETF expert Eric Balchunas. Balchunas further highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively have crossed the $90 billion asset threshold, following a significant $6 billion surge in the past few days. This increase comprises $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs indicates that they are now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. The rise in Bitcoin ETF assets has coincided with a surge in investor confidence, particularly following Donald Trump’s recent victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential elections. This political shift has positively influenced market sentiment, contributing to a broader uptick in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, in particular, has experienced a substantial rally, climbing over 24% to reach a record high of $93,000 in the past week alone.

Title: Where Will the COP29 Money Come From?
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/where-will-the-cop29-money-come-from-11731551991475.html
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:39:51Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- COP29 Daily Reports: Sign up for the Green Daily newsletter for comprehensive coverage of the climate summit right in your inbox. The COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, has been dubbed the “finance COP” because its primary objective is to come up with a new and ambitious agreement for climate-related transfers from rich countries to poor countries. But that moniker could have been given to almost any of the other recent United Nations gatherings of world leaders: the COP26 confab in Glasgow in 2021 focused on enlisting institutional investors in the fight against global warming; the crowning achievement of the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh the following year was a fund to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change; and at last year’s COP28 event, the United Arab Emirates announced a $30 billion venture to fund emissions reductions projects in partnership with BlackRock Inc., TPG Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. Whether it’s Azerbaijan’s manat, or dirhams, pounds or dollars, every climate conversation circles back to how much it will cost — and who’s going to pay. In Baku, that means fighting over a so-called collective and quantified goal for climate finance. That’s the new post-2025 ambition that’s supposed to replace a target set in 2009 for developed countries to provide $100 billion annually by 2020. The earlier goal has proven controversial since it wasn’t met until 2022, and represents just a fraction of the money needed. Even if the new target were to be set at as much as $1 trillion a year, as some of the most climate-vulnerable states have proposed, that would barely scratch the surface. New research published this week by law firm A&O Shearman details an annual $6 trillion investment gap through 2030 to decarbonize the global economy at a pace required by the Paris climate agreement, to say nothing of the cost of adapting to a warmer, more volatile world. Moving from the billions to the trillions will only be possible by involving the private sector. Yet while COP28 in Dubai drew many of Wall Street’s top leaders, from hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio to BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink, COP29 is set to be a much more low-key affair. This year, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc have sent delegations to Azerbaijan, though these typically include members of their sustainability teams as opposed to senior executives. And that might be the appropriate choice given the more technical nature of this year’s discussion, said Adair Turner, who previously ran Britain’s financial regulator and is now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. Financiers in attendance “will be those who want to interface with people actually building the new energy system, rather than people making grand statements,” he said. The biggest opportunities for Baku may not be “on these grand political statements,” Turner said. “We’re not going to get a tightening of the ‘transitioning beyond fossil fuels’ statement, but what we could get is some very concrete things about technologies,” such as commitments to scale up battery storage and grid interconnections, he said. Daniel Hanna, group head of sustainable and transition finance at Barclays, who has traveled to Baku, said he was “looking forward to talking about the progress that’s been made on climate finance, while recognizing that we need to collaborate to move faster and smarter on scaling the next wave of climate technologies, investing in adaptation and finding new public-private models to scale capital into the Global South.” For Turner, who spoke with Bloomberg Green on the first day of COP29, “the single most important thing” to secure at Baku is “a bigger role for development banks.” And right on cue, on Tuesday, the world’s largest multilateral development banks (MDB) announced a new goal to raise $120 billion in annual climate finance for developing nations by the end of the decade, a significant increase on the $75 billion gathered in 2023. MDBs can use their balance sheets to reduce the risks for private investors from allocating funds to nascent technologies and countries, where high credit risks to corruption typically result in a punitive cost of capital. “Many institutional investors are fiduciaries of retirement assets with a duty to focus on returns, and a lot of climate projects just don’t fit that profile without some risk-sharing or guarantees,” said Cara Williams, global head of ESG, climate and sustainability at Mercer. “We hope to see agreements on more public private partnerships announced at COP29 to de-risk investments and make it easier for private capital to be allocated to sustainable-finance projects.” And with many developed governments “under pressure fiscally,”making a modest contribution toward beefing up the MDBs “ought to be the easy win,” Turner said.“The amount of money that’s required to increase the capital resources of the World Bank are really relatively small compared with other things, so it ought to be the win-win here,” he said. Of course, there are very few easy wins in climate. And that’s especially so with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed climate change while promoting fossil fuels, returning to the White House. Sustainable finance in brief Speaking of which, one of the main drivers behind the right-wing campaign against environmental, social and governance strategies — other than Big Oil and its lobbyists — has been Trump himself. Now that he’s on the way back to the White House, experts expect him to try and finish off ESG. That would mean blocking Securities and Exchange Commission rules for corporate and fund disclosures, and Labor Department requirements on pension funds, according to Rob Du Boff, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The new administration also is expected to put limits on ESG-related shareholder proposals filed during proxy season, he said. “The bottom line is the Trump administration is anxious to undermine these ESG-related initiatives,” Du Boff said.
