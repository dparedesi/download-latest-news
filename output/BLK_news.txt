US stock market today tumbled sharply. The Dow dropped 504 points, the S&P 500 fell 1.3%, and the Nasdaq slid nearly 2%. Renewed U.S.-China trade tensions rattled investors. Tech and AI stocks led losses, with Nvidia, Tesla, and Oracle hitting the hardest. Rising tariffs, sanctions on Hanwha Ocean subsidiaries, and market volatility pushed investors toward safe-haven assets like gold. Wall Street now braces for further swings as Powell’s Fed speech looms.

If the company—which disclosed a record $13.46 trillion in assets under management—could move toward offering ETFs as tokens to investors, then that would broaden access to capital markets and reduce fees, he said during the firm’s third-quarter earnings broadcast. As BlackRock leans deeper into digital assets, Fink said the firm is already “having conversations with all the major platforms” in finance about how they can play a role in BlackRock’s tokenization push, within the context of digital wallets. Since Fink touted tokenization as the future of markets in 2022, he has remained as a high-profile backer of the technology on Wall Street, serving as a potential harbinger for how the most influential financial institutions could adopt digital assets over time. “It is our belief that we need to be moving rapidly,” Fink said of tokenization. “We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries.” Although BlackRock isn’t focusing on digital representations of real estate, Fink highlighted it as one area that tokenization could reduce fees. Because every intermediary involved is charging fees, Fink said tokenization could make home ownership more affordable. Tokenized assets have seen some adoption among individual investors, but Fink said “young people” are the ones that are heavily using them. Introducing them to more traditional assets sooner could allow investors to better prepare for life events like retirement, he posited. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, which debuted last year, is among the largest tokenized assets at $2.8 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. As of Tuesday, it had 89 holders, while being issued by a firm called Securitize. BlackRock led a $47 million strategic funding round in Securitize this year. BlackRock’s Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, Joseph Chalom, called the firm’s investment “another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy” at the time. BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $93 billion and $17 billion worth of assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass data. Although BlackRock is racing towards tokenized markets, Fink suggested that it might be a while before the public gets a clearer look at what the Wall Street titan has in store “I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of all assets,” he said. “We're spending a great deal of time on the tech. I'm trying to develop our own technology related to this."

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Eyes Bigger Role in Tokenization

BlackRock (BLK), the asset management giant overseeing more than $13 trillion of assets, is ramping up efforts to bring traditional finance (TradiFi) onchain, seeking a bigger role in tokenization as a way to unlock access to markets and streamline how assets are traded. Teams across the firm are exploring how to use tokenization to make markets more efficient and accessible, with leadership hinting at bigger moves ahead, CEO Larry Fink said during an earnings call following its earnings release Tuesday. "I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of our assets," Fink said. Fink said that he sees digital asset — a market currently worth over $4.5 trillion — growing "significantly" over the next few years. BlackRock was among the firsts to issue spot-based bitcoin BTC$110.662,45 and ether ETH$3.987,53 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., and are the largest products of their kind with $93 billion and $17 billion in assets under management (AUM), respectively. The asset manager is also behind the largest tokenized money market fund on the market, the $2.8 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) issued with tokenization specialist Securitize and available across various blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. BlackRock led Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year betting on tokenization gaining traction. BlackRock's AUM grew to $13.4 trillion in the third quarter of the year, up from $11.4 trillion in the previous year. The firm reported $61 million in revenue from its digital asset products, only a fraction of the company's total revenue of $6.5 billion, per the earnings release. BlackRock shares traded around 1.5% higher during morning trading on Tuesday.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. BlackRock 3.0 is starting to take shape — revenues from its private markets businesses are outpacing fees coming in from its fixed-income mainstays. Despite its world-beating iShares ETF line hitting new highs in the third quarter of 2025, managing more than $5 trillion in assets after record net inflows of more than $150 billion, it's not what the firm's leadership is excited about. Instead, CEO Larry Fink and his team are giddy about subscriptions and a business unit that represents less than 3% of its overall asset base. The firm spent more than $27 billion to acquire private-credit giant HPS, infrastructure investor Global Infrastructure Partners, and private-markets data player Preqin, with the final deal — its $12 billion, all-equity purchase of HPS — closing at the start of the third quarter. Since the GIP deal closed on October 1 of last year, revenues from private market funds and tech subscriptions, including Preqin and BlackRock's existing risk analytics platform Aladdin, have outpaced those from fixed-income funds and ETFs —once the firm's bread and butter — each quarter, and the gap is only going to grow. The firm added roughly $105 billion in private market assets last quarter, thanks to more than $100 billion from HPS. The addition of the private credit business to BlackRock's coffers has helped fuel a 136% growth in fees from private market funds through the first three quarters of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Martin Small, the firm's chief financial officer, said that even without Preqin, tech services revenue is up 12% year-over-year. "I've never been more excited about the future of BlackRock," said Fink, speaking on Tuesday's earnings call. Just as BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion in assets, rode the passive-investing wave in the 2010s to become more than a fixed-income investment manager, the firm has shifted its focus to the lucrative private markets, where fees are higher, capital is stickier, and 401(k) money may soon flood in. This isn't to say the firm has turned away from bond investing. Last quarter, fixed-income funds attracted tens of billions of new capital, and the firm has more than $3 trillion in products focused on the asset class. But BlackRock is focused on where institutional capital is flowing, and Fink and Small spoke Tuesday about the extended conversations the HPS team is having with their insurance clients. GIP raised the largest infrastructure fund ever this summer, at more than $25 billion. "The depth and breadth of BlackRock's global platform," as Fink described the firm's many offerings, is spreading even further. Your daily guide to what's moving markets — straight to your inbox.

Title: ‘Fund The AI Arms Race’—Elon Musk Is Quietly Backing Bitcoin And Issued A ‘Fake Fiat Currency’ Dollar Warning

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire who fell out with U.S. president Donald Trump over his $37 trillion debt-raising tax and spend bill, has once again quietly signaled his support of bitcoin—even as a serious bitcoin price warning light flashes red. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Bitcoin has swung wildly this week as the gold price soars and stock markets plunge on fears Trump could reignite the smoldering U.S. trade war with China, with a bitcoin price "flash crash" over the weekend sparking a serious BlackRock warning. Now, Musk, who has said his new political party would support bitcoin over the U.S. dollar, has praised bitcoin for being "based on energy" and agreed the bitcoin price has soared amid dollar "debasement" designed "to fund the AI arms race." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "AI is the new global arms race, and capex will eventually be funded by governments (U.S. and China). If you want to know why gold/silver/bitcoin is soaring, it’s the 'debasement’ to fund the AI arms race," the ZeroHedge X account posted, adding: “But you can't print energy.” Musk responded, saying: “True," and adding: "That is why bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.” In recent months, the “debasement trade” betting against traditional currencies like the dollar and betting on “hard” assets like gold, silver and bitcoin has taken off, with traders pushing gold, silver and the bitcoin price to record highs. Musk, who has said he personally holds bitcoin, ethereum and the meme-based dogecoin, also agreed with a reply to his post that said, “dogecoin is also based on energy.” Bitcoin, which is secured by a network of so-called miners who use powerful computers to validate transactions in return for newly issued bitcoin, uses as much electricity each year as some small countries, with its energy demands climbing along with its price as more miners join the network. Musk, who helped Trump back into the White House with campaign rallies and warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile that passed $37 trillion this year, dramatically fell out with Trump after he failed to rein in government spending, while Musk’s own department of government efficiency (Doge) initiative has so far failed to make the multi-trillion dollar savings it originally promised. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Musk’s support for bitcoin and crypto has waned from its Covid-era peak, though Musk has continued to give backing to bitcoin, as well as his "favorite" cryptocurrency dogecoin. Following his White House exit, Musk said his America Party would favor bitcoin over the U.S. dollar, with Musk branding the dollar and other non-asset backed currencies as “hopeless.” Disquiet over so-called fiat currencies has grow in the years following the huge 2008 financial crisis bailouts that directly led to the creation of bitcoin and then Covid lockdown stimulus measures that flooded the economy with trillions of freshly printed dollars. Government stimulus and supply chain disrupting lockdowns sparked massive global inflation, which some fear has put the U.S. dollar into "death spiral" as the Federal Reserve is forced to create more dollars to pay off interest on its existing debt.

Title: Markets Set For Lower Open As China Conflict Continues
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinebrock/2025/10/14/markets-set-for-lower-open-as-china-conflict-continues/

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. U.S. stocks rebounded Monday but poised to open lower Tuesday as the trade conflict with China continues. Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 have dipped 1%, Nasdaq 100 futures are 1.2% lower and Dow Jones futures are down 0.6%. The back-and-forth of stock prices tracks with the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs after China restricted the export of rare earth minerals last week. Trump then walked back his aggressive tone, assuring the public in a Truth Social post that the trade disagreement was resolvable. Tuesday, China sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of a South Korean shipmaker. After trade tensions flared last week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to $21.99 from $17.09. The index retreated to a still-elevated level of $19.03 before eclipsing $21 again. The VIX Index quantifies market expectations for near-term volatility, based on S&P 500 option prices. On the inflation front, a new analysis by Goldman Sachs concludes that U.S. tariffs will raise prices by year-end. According to a research note summarized by the LA Times, analysts said U.S. consumers will probably absorb 55% of tariff costs while American companies pay 22%. Only 18% of tariff costs were projected to hit foreign exporters. If the projections prove accurate, the Federal Reserve’s job of stimulating jobs while managing inflation could get complicated. Earnings season begins Tuesday with scheduled reports from JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Blackrock, and others. Third quarter reports will demonstrate how corporate profits are trending amid the unique circumstances in 2025. Themes to watch include: What is a good P/S ratio? The price-to-sales or P/S ratio is a metric investors use to evaluate a company’s stock price. It is particularly useful for companies that aren’t profitable because you can calculate it without positive earnings. Like the P/E ratio, the P/S requires context to interpret. A low P/S ratio could mean the company is undervalued or that investors are not confident in the company’s future. A high P/S indicates investors are willing to pay more for the company’s sales—which is good when the company lives into the optimism, and bad when it does not. You can calculate the P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its revenue over the last 12 months. Alternatively, you can calculate a forward P/S ratio as the company’s market capitalization divided by its expected revenue over the next 12 months. The two calculations quantify what investors are willing to pay for $1 of the company’s previous or expected sales. The P/S ratio is most valuable in comparisons. You can compare a P/S ratio to: Lower P/S ratios are generally associated with lower growth expectations, while higher P/S ratios imply more optimistic growth expectations. And this makes sense: The standard P/S calculation uses a sales figure that’s already happened, but investors make trading decisions on their future predictions. If investors expect next year’s sales to be, say, 50% higher, they’ll accept a higher stock price. Mathematically, a higher stock price increases the market capitalization which raises the P/S ratio. This is why fast-growing industries, like technology, have higher P/S ratios than more predictable industries such as utilities. Value investors prefer P/S ratios below 1 or no higher than 2, assuming the company has a fundamentally productive business model and healthy balance sheet. Growth investors tolerate or even gravitate towards higher P/S ratios because they can signal outperformance relative to peers. These P/S ratios as of Oct. 10, 2025, demonstrate how this metric can vary dramatically by business and industry. The average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is 3.17.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The veteran crypto founder Mo Shaikh isn’t afraid to be brash. When asked why his new venture capital firm was called Maximum Frequency, or MF, Ventures, he said the name was a “nice play on letters.” Which letters? The same ones for “motherf–ker,” he implied, laughing. “It kind of takes that level of grind and focus to really be a founder,” he told Fortune. In other words, to be a great founder requires “f–k you” energy. On Tuesday, Shaikh, the cofounder of the well-known blockchain development company Aptos Labs, announced that he and three former colleagues had raised $50 million for a new venture fund that will focus on crypto companies. “We want to help each founder hit their maximum frequency,” he said. Once a novelty in venture capital, crypto-focused funds are now commonplace, and Maximum Frequency will join a landscape defined by the likes of Paradigm, Dragonfly, and Haun Ventures, among others. Shaikh’s three other cofounders are Neil Harounian, the first employee Shaikh hired at Aptos Labs and the startup’s former head of ecosystem; Alexandre Tang, the former head of APAC institutions at Aptos Labs; and Jerome Ong, the former APAC ecosystem lead. While Shaikh wouldn’t disclose from whom he had raised the money, he did say the fund’s limited partners include family offices in the U.S., East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The four cofounders have also put their own money into the fund, Shaikh said, declining to specify how much. “We do have skin in the game,” he said. The new company comes amid a sluggish period for crypto venture capital. Despite soaring prices for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, venture investments in crypto dropped 55% to $6.8 billion from the first to second quarter of this year, according to data from Pitchbook. And VCs more broadly are struggling to raise new capital. The sector raised $50 billion from limited partners in the first half of 2025. That puts the venture capital industry on a much slower pace than 2024, when it raised nearly $190 billion over the entire year, per Pitchbook. Still, the four cofounders of Maximum Frequency Ventures believe they can fight the headwinds. Shaikh is a crypto and finance veteran. He started his career at financial behemoths like the accounting firm KPMG and the asset manager BlackRock. In 2020, he landed a gig at Meta to work on strategic partnerships for the social media giant’s now-scuttled blockchain project. In late 2021, shortly before Meta publicly gave up on its crypto ambitions, the Big Tech giant gave Shaikh and his colleague Avery Ching its blessing to use Meta’s proprietary software to launch a high-speed blockchain, which the two dubbed Aptos. The project was a venture darling, and the duo raised more than $400 million for their company Aptos Labs, according to data from Pitchbook. But, after about three years at the startup, Shaikh stepped down as CEO in December and Ching took his place. While Shaikh initially said he was stepping away to focus on “a new chapter,” he didn’t specify in any more detail why he was leaving. He declined to comment further to Fortune. Aptos continues to be one of the major blockchains and its cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of nearly $3 billion. Shaikh and his cofounders are now focused on building and supporting companies along with other founders. And it’s their background working at a high-profile startup they believe will separate them from other crypto VCs, said Shaikh and cofounder Neil Harounian. “There aren’t really any funds in crypto that incubate,” added Harounian. As opposed to other VCs who, they argue, passively write checks into startups, the four cofounders will actively work with founders to build out their businesses—and even start companies in house. So far, Maximum Frequency Ventures has deployed $5 million into six startups, Shaikh said. While the crypto venture firm hasn’t yet announced the deals, he said the founders they’ve backed are geographically diverse, from Texas to Abu Dhabi to South Korea. The team has specifically focused on looking for founders in Asia as opposed to only in the U.S., said Shaikh. “We’re very hands on. We’re very active,” he said. “It’s a quality game, not a quantity game.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Elizabeth Warren: Leftism for Thee But Not Me

Full Content:
When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With fellow Senate traveler Bernie Sanders, Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed Democratic Socialists such as Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals – a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism – the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the one-time presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again. Charity Doesn’t Begin at Home Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books – and even in-flight WiFi to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism – even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Fat Cat Investments Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions – Vanguard and TIAA-CREF – hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp – the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she recently said. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Exempting Some Millionaires Slamming the president’s “Big Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit (the) highest income earners.” She would know – she’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and her husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Restrictive Neighborhoods Home ownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and D.C. that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes – including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge city council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to the Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood – one of the least affordable in the state – she remains silent. Cambridge council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of D.C., which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Dubious Identity Politics Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage – even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University. “She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry.” “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Resilient consumer spending despite higher borrowing costs helped sustain the US economic momentum, fuelling gains in equity markets and prompting investors to pour money back into lower-cost index strategies. A cooling labour market and moderating inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September - its first reduction this year - while expectations of further easing later in 2025 fuelled strong inflows into BlackRock's fixed-income exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This inflow helped the firm offset softer performance fees and higher costs linked to the acquisition of alternative asset manager HPS Investment Partners. BlackRock's assets under management rose to $13.46 trillion in the quarter, up from $11.48 trillion a year earlier. Long-term net inflows totalled about $171 billion, led by continued strength in its ETF business, which remains the firm's key driver of organic growth. The world's largest asset manager reported adjusted earnings of $1.91 billion, or $11.55 per share, for the three months to September 30, up from $1.72 billion, or $11.46 per share, a year earlier.

Title: Trump’s 401(k) Bitcoin Order: What It Means For Your Retirement Portfolio

Time Published: 2025-10-14T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByTonya M. Evans, Contributor. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calls something “the domain of money launderers and thieves,” market experts pay attention. So, on Sunday, October 12, when he referred to bitcoin by telling CBS’s “60 Minutes” host, Lesley Stahl, that “markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,” the reversal was notable. Although, given Blackrock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund impressive performance data, the change of heart was also not surprising. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) became the fastest fund ever to reach $10 billion in assets after launching in January 2024. Now it holds nearly $100 billion, more than any other ETF in BlackRock's 1,000-plus fund lineup. But Fink’s new optimism about digital assets isn’t coincidental; it actually mirrors that of President Donald Trump’s August 7, 2025 executive order, which explicitly opened 401(k) plans to “holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets.” The order's logic is straightforward: wealthy Americans and government workers access alternative investments through pension plans, but 90 million Americans in employer-sponsored retirement plans don't. “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers' retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement,” the order states. The 2025 State of the Crypto Holders Report from the National Cryptocurrency Association found that 76% of users say crypto has had a positive impact on their lives, underscoring its move from niche experiment to mainstream asset class. For the 55 million Americans already using crypto, the question isn’t whether digital assets belong in portfolios, it is merely how to access these assets safely. Yet this rise in crypto adoption comes amid a systematic weakening of fiduciary-duty standards and oversight mechanisms that once protected U.S. retirement savers from high-risk products. This leaves investors to navigate a rapidly expanding market with fewer regulatory guardrails. Ironically, financial innovations like Bitcoin and blockchain technology may themselves offer some of the transparency and accountability that lawmakers and regulators have struggled to provide by law. That’s the benefit of using public, distributed ledgers. CNBC anchor and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin is deeply concerned about the too-big-to-continue climate the stock market is in. Sorkin told “60 Minutes” this week that he sees disturbing parallels of today’s market to America's worst crash. “I’m anxious we are at prices that may not feel sustainable,” Sorkin said, adding that we’re either “living through some kind of remarkable boom" or "reliving 1929.” As Sorkin explains in his book “1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How It Shattered a Nation,” Wall Street “democratized” stock investing right before the 1929 crash by letting buyers purchase with 10% down, borrowing the rest from brokers. “It was all wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,” Sorkin explained. “In good times it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook in a very bad way.” Now that the Trump administration is taking a more lenient approach to consumer protections, the parallels are stark. “There’s speculation in the market today, there’s an increasing amount of debt, and all of that’s happening against the backdrop of the guard rails coming off,” Sorkin wrote. For most Americans, those guardrails are not abstract—they protect the only wealth they have. According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finance and analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, approximately two-thirds of U.S. household wealth is concentrated in two asset categories: primary residences and employer-sponsored retirement accounts. The executive order acknowledges this tension, promising to “curb ERISA litigation that constrains fiduciaries’ ability to apply their best judgment.” Critics hear 1920s deregulation. Supporters hear removal of paternalistic barriers preventing working Americans from accessing investments available to the wealthy. Americans approaching retirement are caught in the middle—and skeptical. In fact, a recent Boldin survey of over 1,000 Americans found that nearly half oppose adding alternative assets like crypto to their 401(k)s, only about one-third support the idea, and roughly 80% say they’re unlikely to invest any portion of their retirement savings in such assets. However, there is a critical difference between 1929’s bubble and the 2025 bitcoin bull market: Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 crisis and designed to (among other things) address the same systemic vulnerabilities Sorkin fears. On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto embedded a message in the Genesis Block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” It wasn’t random, it was a timestamp and philosophical statement about why Bitcoin needed to exist. While governments rescued failing banks with taxpayer money, Nakamoto proposed an alternative: a monetary system with no central authority to bail out, no fractional reserve banking to collapse, no ‘too big to fail’ institutions. Bitcoin wasn't created to ride boom cycles. It was created to survive—and provide an alternative during—the exact breakdowns Sorkin describes. Fixed supply vs. credit expansion. The 1929 crash stemmed partly from unconstrained credit creation. Bitcoin's protocol enforces a hard cap of 21 million coins—no authority can “print” more to bail out failing entities. Transparent settlement vs. opacity. 1929 exposed massive hidden leverage and counterparty failures. Bitcoin settles transparently every ten minutes with no trading halts or ability for authorities to freeze markets during panics. Equal access vs. gatekeeping. Sorkin rightly warns about retail investors accessing opaque private equity deals. Bitcoin offers radically equal access—the same blockchain data available to BlackRock is available to every investor. No insider information. Self-custody option vs. mandatory intermediation. Unlike 1929's stock certificates held by brokers who could face insolvency, Bitcoin enables self-custody—eliminating counterparty risk entirely. The executive order’s inclusion of digital assets isn’t comparable to credit-fueled stock speculation. As head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management, Gerry O’Shea told Reuters: “Bitcoin has moved beyond its early days as a merely speculative asset and is slowly entering into many investors' long-term investment strategy. This EO will help accelerate this trend.” The industry response has been bullish. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz called the executive order's potential impact “a monster pool of capital,” telling CNBC it represents a widening of avenues “for bringing more people into the tent” of crypto adoption. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was equally emphatic, following his company’s May 2025 inclusion in the S&P 500, he told Yahoo Finance: “Crypto is here to stay. It's going to be a part of everyone's 401(k).” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse advocates for diversified crypto exposure in institutional portfolios. “I own XRP, BTC, and ETH, among a handful of others—we live in a multichain world, and I’ve advocated for a level-playing field instead of one token versus another,” Garlinghouse posted on X. His multichain philosophy aligns with emerging retirement product development. As Grayscale’s diversified crypto ETF filing demonstrates, institutional investors increasingly recognize that different digital assets serve different purposes, bitcoin as digital gold and ether for decentralized applications and smart contracts, for example. A sophisticated ecosystem is emerging that balances access with safeguards: Whether this represents breakthrough or breakdown depends on execution, not on Bitcoin’s software protocol, which has proven resilient for 17 years and counting. But whether fiduciaries implement prudent limits and regulators deliver promised clarity by early 2026. Sorkin's 1929 warning carries weight. But the opacity and leverage that fueled that collapse are precisely what Bitcoin's architecture eliminates: transparent settlement, no fractional reserves, no hidden counterparty risk. The real danger isn't Bitcoin—it's whether fiduciaries treat it as speculation rather than strategic hedge, and whether promised regulatory safeguards materialize or stall. Trump's executive order opened the door. How fiduciaries and investors walk through it will determine whether we are witnessing democratization or simply repeating 1929’s grave errors with more sophisticated technology.

NEW DELHI: Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) have begun the sale process for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)-owned Vena Global Group Pte Ltd’s Indian renewable energy platform, Vena Energy India, in a deal having an enterprise value of around $1 billion, according to two people familiar with the development. The deal comes amid a steady flow of global capital into India’s clean energy market. The sale, code-named Project Indigo, marks Global Infrastructure Partners’ full exit from its bet on Vena Energy. The sale process was formally launched this month. GIP itself was acquired by BlackRock Inc. in October last year. Vena Energy India operates 957 megawatts (MW) of renewable power assets, with another 59 MW under construction. GIP, along with CIC Capital Corp. (CIC Capital) and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), had acquired Singapore-based renewable energy developer Equis Energy for $5 billion in October 2017. The acquisition included $1.3 billion in liabilities and Equis’s Indian portfolio, which comprised green energy platforms Energon and Energon Soleq. The assets were later rebranded as Vena Energy and structured as a corporate platform in Singapore. “Vena Energy projects have a weighted average residual power purchase agreement (PPA) of 17 years, with a ₹4.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or per unit weighted average tariff," said one of the two people cited above requesting anonymity. Vena Energy has been active in India for over a decade through its earlier avatar Equis Energy. Its portfolio includes an advanced pipeline of 1.25 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind projects and 752 megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery energy storage systems (BESS). It also has 1.46 GW of early- to mid-stage solar and wind projects under development and 100 MWh of additional BESS capacity. Spokespersons for GIP and MUFG declined to comment. A PSP Investments spokesperson said in an emailed response, “Our policy is to not comment on market rumours or speculation. We will therefore not participate in the story." Queries emailed to representatives of Vena Global Group, Morgan Stanley, and CIC Capital on Sunday night went unanswered at press time. Green energy dealmaking surgesIndia’s renewable energy sector has been driving merger and acquisition activity, accounting for about $8.5 billion worth of deals, roughly 80% of all power sector transactions, in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to EY. The report noted that India now counts over 60 marquee global investors in its green energy space. “In Asia Pacific, India stands out as a dynamic market, with energy security and ambitious clean-energy targets (backed by government initiatives in renewables, battery storage and green hydrogen) creating a favourable environment for M&A activity," wrote PwC in its 2025 mid-year outlook report. “Asia Pacific continues to focus on investments to meet ambitious clean-energy targets, as well as investments in electrification and critical mineral supply chains. For example, in India, goals to hit 500 GW non-fossil fuel-based energy generation and 61 GW/336 GWh of energy storage targets by 2030 are driving M&A activity in renewables, green energy and electric vehicles," the PwC report said. The momentum is underpinned by India’s rapid capacity expansion. The country’s installed renewable energy capacity stands at 245 GW, with solar and wind contributing 116 GW and 52 GW, respectively. India aims to add 50 GW of new capacity annually to reach 500 GW by 2030, 1,800 GW by 2047, and 5,000 GW by 2070 as part of its net-zero roadmap. India accounted for 5.6% of the record 306 terawatt-hours (TWh) of global solar generation growth in the first half of 2025, which rose 31% year-on-year, according to think tank Ember. “Examples of recent notable transactions in this space include JSW Neo Energy’s acquisition of the 4.6 GW O2 portfolio and ONGC NTPC Green’s 4.1 GW Ayana platform deal," the PwC report said. Investor appetite for operational and under-construction assets is strong, with hybrid models gaining traction. Government support is expected to drive further M&A energy and infrastructure activity across the region. Two examples of this supportive policy environment include the Indian government’s initiative to integrate biogas into the national gas grid and its recent revision of the Domestic Content Requirement policy to boost domestic solar cell manufacturing, it added. Recent deal activity underscores the growing investor interest. European alternative asset manager EQT, for instance, dropped plans to sell renewable developer Zelestra’s India business, transferring it instead to its Asia-Pacific infrastructure arm led by Hong Kong-based partner Ken Wong. EQT will invest around $600 million to expand the portfolio and has appointed Parag Sharma—former CEO and founder of EQT- and Temasek-backed O2 Power—as Zelestra’s new chief executive, replacing Sajay K.V. In another deal, Nasdaq-listed ReNew Energy Global Plc agreed to sell 300 MW of solar assets to Singapore’s Sembcorp Industries Ltd, valuing the equity and enterprise at around $100 million and $190 million, respectively. Sembcorp, along with Torrent Power Ltd, Inox Green Energy Services Ltd (of the INOXGFL Group), and General Atlantic-owned Actis LLP, is also among the shortlisted bidders for Macquarie Asset Management’s Green Investment Group (GIG) platform, Vibrant Energy.

Title: BlackRock purchases $60M worth of Bitcoin

Share this article BlackRock clients purchased around $60 million worth of Bitcoin on Monday, continuing the asset management firm’s accumulation during market volatility. BlackRock, a major asset management firm, has been facilitating client investments in Bitcoin through its spot ETF products. The purchase reflects institutional resilience amid recent market dips. BlackRock has been the sole issuer adding Bitcoin to its holdings during recent periods of price volatility, positioning itself as a key player in long-term crypto adoption. The investment pattern represents a broader trend of wealth transfer from retail sellers to Wall Street accumulators. BlackRock clients, including institutional and retail investors, continue stacking Bitcoin through the firm’s products even in non-surging markets. This sustained accumulation by BlackRock clients could intensify future rallies as selling pressure from retail investors eases, according to market observers tracking institutional Bitcoin adoption patterns.

Title: World's Largest Asset Manager Believes Bitcoin "Serves Same Purpose As Gold" - Here's Why
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/worlds-largest-asset-manager-blackrock-larry-fink-believes-bitcoin-serves-same-purpose-as-gold-heres-why
Time Published: 2025-10-14T02:40:08Z

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has recently walked back on his previous claims about Bitcoin being an 'index of money laundering' and admitted that the cryptocurrency serves the same purpose as gold in one's portfolio. “I did say Bitcoin, because we were talking about Bitcoin then, was the domain of money launderers and thieves," Fink told CBS on Sunday. “But you know, the markets teach you, you have to always re-look your assumptions. There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative," he added. Fink's comments on Bitcoin come at a time when cryptocurrencies worldwide witnessed large liquidations, motivated by Donald Trump's warning to China on Friday. Most cryptocurrencies suffered a beating, with Bitcoin dropping down from $125,000 levels to $104,000. Ethereum, too, saw a massive drawdown, falling to $3,700 levels. Bitcoins has since recovered and is trading around $114,000 levels, with the entire crypto market adding $550 billion in value since Friday's close. Fink, though, asserted caution, adding that Bitcoin is not a bad asset, but it should not form a major part of your portfolio. “For those looking to diversify, it is not a bad asset, but I don’t believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio,” he said. Earlier this month, similar words were echoed by Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. In an exclusive conversation with NDTV Profit, Powell said, “Having a 2% exposure to Bitcoin could make sense. The same goes for Gold." BlackRock is the world’s largest money manager that oversees roughly $12.5 trillion in assets. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest crypto ETF with more than $93.9 billion in assets under management.

Title: Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/13/blackrock-utilities-across-america/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T22:35:32Z
Full Content:
Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda. In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.” “BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’) In an aerial view, the IAD71 Amazon Web Services data center is shown on July 17, 2024 in Ashburn, Virginia. (Photo by Nathan Howard via Getty Images) Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration. Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups. Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion. BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story. Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.” The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital. Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.” Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024. “Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.” Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.” “Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar. “What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said.

(Photo by Spencer Platt via Getty Images) University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.” Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases. “There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.” ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition. “BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.” Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.” Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May. The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

CNBC reported Monday that the bank has been developing a custody service for digital assets over the past two to three years, citing an interview with global head of partnerships and innovation Biswarup Chatterjee. Citi did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment, but Chatterjee was quoted saying that the upcoming custody service would involve Citi holding the digital coins and tokens for clients. "We're hoping that in the next few quarters, we can come to market with a credible custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients," Chatterjee told CNBC. The move would signal traditional banks pushing further into the world of digital assets. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds managed by Wall Street titans like BlackRock and Fidelity, a number of top American banks have expressed interest in moving deeper into the digital asset space. JP Morgan is advancing stablecoin development, while Morgan Stanley is working to enable customers to trade digital coins Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana via its E*Trade platform. Just last week, major banks Banco Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG Bank Ltd, TD Bank Group, and UBS announced that they were collectively exploring a "1:1 reserve-backed form of digital money"—or stablecoin. President Donald Trump campaigned on a ticket to help the crypto industry, and this year has pushed a number of crypto-friendly laws as regulatory industries have pulled back on crypto-related enforcement. Regulators under previous U.S. administrations have been more cautious and sometimes hostile towards the crypto space.

There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative,” he said. In his latest comments, however, Fink also urged caution. “For those looking to diversify, it is not a bad asset, but I don’t believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio,” he added. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, oversees roughly $12.5 trillion in assets. It launched one of the first U.S. crypto spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 following regulatory approval from the SEC. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest crypto ETF with more than $93.9 billion assets under management. Fink’s shift in tone over the years is in line with a broader softening of Wall Street’s stance on cryptocurrencies. He was part of a cohort of CEOs who once dismissed Bitcoin outright. In 2017, he called it an “index of money laundering,” while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described it as “a fraud” and said people who owned it were “stupid,” likening the asset to the Dutch tulip mania in the 1630s. Since then, the mood has changed, with Fink taking a more conciliatory tone from 2023 onwards. Major financial firms, from asset managers to investment banks, are gradually moving into the crypto sector, drawn by investor demand even as they warn of volatility and regulatory risk. In a letter to investors earlier this year, Fink himself noted that half of the demand for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has been "from retail investors, and three-quarters of those investors had never owned an iShares product before." Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Fabian Dori told Decrypt that particularly since the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump, the embrace of crypto assets has moved from institutional involvement to institutional adoption. “If there was any need for further confirmation of the increasing institutional adoption, it has probably been provided by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink flagging Bitcoin as a potential replacement of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency in case the U.S. debt situation would spiral out of control," he said. "These developments have driven Bitcoin dominance, the share of Bitcoin’s market cap relative to the total crypto asset market cap, to a level not seen for years." Leading global traditional asset managers such as BlackRock or Fidelity have already added Bitcoin to the strategic asset allocation of some of their investment products, while corporations such as Tesla, Strategy, and Metaplanet have integrated Bitcoin into their corporate strategy as a hedge against inflation. Dori added institutions are interested in three key use cases: Specific crypto assets as an alternative store of value, specific crypto assets as an alternative means of payment and specific crypto assets as a next-generation infrastructure that enables decentralized application economies. “Increased macro uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and the growing risk of currency debasement are factors that promote Bitcoin’s safe haven or store of value attributes,” he said. Still, not everyone is convinced. Last week, British investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown warned users to steer clear of Bitcoin, calling it an asset with “no intrinsic value.” In a notice to clients, the firm said crypto “shouldn’t be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals.” But firms are still feeling pressure to meet customer demand for these sorts of products. Hargreaves Lansdown itself, which manages $226.8 billion (£170 billion) in assets, nevertheless said it would still allow qualified investors to access new British crypto exchange-traded notes despite their warning. Bitcoin was trading above $115,000 on Monday, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The price recovery follows a sharp dip on Friday, when it slid from $121,000 to $109,000 within hours, triggering nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions.

Title: Women CFOs Outperform. Here’s How Humana And Merck Prove It.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecarter/2025/10/13/women-cfos-outperform-heres-how-humana-and-merck-prove-it/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T13:41:28Z
Full Content:
ByChristine Michel Carter, Senior Contributor. When companies put women in charge of the balance sheet, the numbers get better. A OneStream study titled The Glass Chair: Unlocking the value of women in finance finds that appointing a woman as CFO correlates with a 10% boost in performance for previously underperforming firms. The report also shows that companies led by women CFOs deliver stronger returns and lead in digital innovation. Proof that when women take the helm of corporate finance, results follow. Few executives illustrate that better than Celeste Mellet, CFO of Humana, and Caroline Litchfield, CFO of Merck. Both women have built careers at the intersection of finance, operations, and transformation. They’re navigating complex, regulated industries where the stakes are high and the margin for error is slim. The study reveals that women take three or more years longer than men to reach the CFO seat, often through cross-functional and global roles rather than a straight accounting track. Across Global 500 and FTSE 100 companies, women average 18 years to reach the position; in healthcare and life sciences, it can take about 21 years. Both Mellet and Litchfield exemplify that trajectory. Each built decades-long careers across multiple business functions before assuming the top finance role. This is proof that while women may take a longer route, the path often results in broader, more adaptive leadership. Humana appointed Mellet as CFO in December 2024, following her tenure as CFO at Global Infrastructure Partners (acquired by BlackRock). Before that, she held senior finance positions at Evercore, Fannie Mae, and Morgan Stanley, where she spent nearly two decades leading treasury, investor relations, and equity research. Mellet brings more than 25 years of experience across global finance and infrastructure, including nearly two decades at Global 500 companies such as Morgan Stanley and Fannie Mae. Though early in her tenure at Humana, the company’s first-quarter 2025 results exceeded analyst expectations, with adjusted EPS of $11.58, roughly 16% above consensus, according to Nasdaq. Humana reaffirmed its full-year guidance, signaling investor confidence amid industry headwinds in Medicare and healthcare services. Her disciplined approach to capital allocation and risk management positions Humana to sustain long-term performance, and aligns with the study finding that women CFOs tend to outperform in both returns and innovation. At Merck, Litchfield has led finance since April 2021, overseeing the company’s finance, procurement, and real estate functions. Over a 35-year career entirely within Merck, she has served as head of finance for global markets across Europe, Canada, and emerging economies, as well as senior vice president of treasury and global human health. Litchfield’s steady ascent reflects the “longer road” women often take, gaining operational expertise across continents before reaching the top. Under her leadership, Merck has maintained consistent revenue growth, with 2024 sales exceeding $60 billion, driven by oncology and vaccine strength, according to the company’s financial report. Her disciplined investment and focus on sustainable innovation have helped Merck balance growth with shareholder stability. Research from McKinsey and LeanIn.org shows that women make up just 29% of the entire C-suite, and even fewer are mothers. They experience heightened “onlyness,” being one of the few women in senior leadership. While Litchfield has publicly acknowledged motherhood and Mellet has not commented on family life, both represent a generation of leaders who navigate professional excellence alongside personal complexity. Women CFOs in the study also report leading on digital adoption: 83% cite AI and automation as central to efficiency and transformation. It’s a reminder that the modern CFO’s influence extends far beyond accounting. To explore what’s behind these findings, I spoke with Pam McIntyre, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller at OneStream. She explained that the results aren’t just statistical noise. “We controlled for sector and market movement so the signal we saw was real,” McIntyre said. “When a woman steps into the CFO seat, you tend to see stronger returns and faster innovation because her path there often spans strategy, operations, and transformation—not just accounting.” Boards seeking consistent returns and strategic innovation might not need to look outside the organization for their next growth driver. They may simply need to promote her. Mellet and Litchfield are part of a growing cohort of women transforming how global corporations measure performance and value creation. Their paths demonstrate that inclusion in finance leadership is a sound strategy.

According to Deloitte report there are currently 8,030 family offices worldwide, collectively managing approximately $3.1 trillion in assets. This total is projected to increase by 73 percent, reaching $5.4 trillion by 2030, which would exceed the present global hedge fund industry's assets under management ($5 trillion). The number of family offices is anticipated to rise to 10,720 by 2030. North America is the largest, wealthiest hub for family offices, Europe the oldest, and Asia Pacific the fastest growing. Family offices have traditionally been slower to adopt emerging technologies; however, the expectations of younger family members are driving demand for AI-enabled solutions that provide real-time insights and hyper personalised content. Additionally, with the growing allocation to alternative investments and the voluminous data associated with this asset class, family offices are witnessing increasing dependence on advanced technology and integration of AI powered tools. Family offices that integrate AI into their operations will achieve enhanced efficiency and deliver superior client service, whereas those that do not may face competitive disadvantages. According to Citibank’ 2025 Global Family Office Report, the top priorities for technology adoption includes investment management and data analytics platforms (50%), consolidated reporting (39%), and cybersecurity & data protection (37%). Additionally, AI & machine learning (28%) was cited ahead of the remaining priorities including accounting and document management. Apart from these Family member education tools (18%), Alternative investment management (10%) are among the other stated priorities. They key barriers to technology adoption in the family office includes lack of internal expertise (57%) as well as a lack of awareness of available options (34%). Furthermore, cybersecurity or privacy concerns (28%) and uncertainty over return on investment (25%) are also obstacles for technology adoption. Early adopters of AI are using its core capabilities to provide comprehensive portfolio insights, highly personalised market research on emerging themes and investment recommendations, as well as streamlined process automation. Select industry leading examples The following industry-leading examples illustrate approaches to serving high-net-worth individuals, and family offices will find these use cases valuable when developing their own AI strategies. AI has potential to transform the family offices by streamlining processes and automating routine tasks, AI will allow family office advisors to dedicate greater attention to strategic and value-added activities. Key considerations for AI powered solutions include, Conclusion AI is significantly advancing family office technology; nevertheless, achieving optimal results depends on strategic implementation that integrates AI's capabilities with human oversight and expert domain knowledge. AI led transformation will benefit for both single-family offices (SFOs) and multi-family offices (MFOs) including intelligent data management, automated reporting, enhanced governance, and the ability to identify new investment opportunities, leading to increased efficiency and potential returns. The AI powered solutions will allow family offices to unlock efficiencies, deepen insights, and deliver better outcomes for UHNW clients.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has rebounded from a weekend “flash crash” that caused a $500 billion crypto market meltdown and a serious BlackRock warning. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price, which briefly plunged to almost $100,000 per bitcoin from a peak of $126,000 earlier in the week, has climbed back to around $114,000 ahead of a “perfect storm” some see on the horizon. Now, amid a “cascade” bitcoin price warning, the price of gold has surged to a fresh all-time high—something that could mean further volatility for the bitcoin price and crypto market. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “Stock markets, cryptocurrencies and the oil price are all regaining some ground after Friday’s rout, but gold and silver continue to power higher, even as president Trump offers soothing words about the hoped-for summit between China and the U.S., to suggest that someone, somewhere is still feeling nervous,” AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said in emailed comments. After U.S. president Donald Trump reignited the U.S.-China trade war with threats of 100% tariffs on China’s goods coming into the U.S. on Friday, he has tried to defuse the situation, posting that Truth Social that “it will all be fine.” Trade tensions remain a focus for markets, with UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo telling Reuters that "while they have eased again between the U.S. and China, the 100% additional tariff threat remains." While bitcoin is sometimes called "digital gold" due to its limited supply, it continues to trade more like a high-growth technology stock, with traders abandoning it in favour of gold in times of uncertainty. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “Gold and silver surged to new all-time highs as investors added to their exposure,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. "The rally in both metals currently seems relentless, as recent gains have now extended over multiple sessions and show little sign of fatigue despite being considered extremely overbought. It appears that every event only increases the appeal of both gold and silver. Certainly, president Trump’s fresh tariff threat increased demand, while prices rose again after he toned down his attack over the weekend. Could this be evidence of a blow-off top? Maybe. So far there has been no significant pullback, which forces traders who feel underweight in the two metals to pay up, even as they trade at record levels." After gold hit a fresh all-time high of almost $4,100 per ounce, Bank of America raised its 2026 outlook for gold to $5,000.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT Is Nearing $100B in AUM. Everyone Else Might Be Chasing ‘Crumbs’

As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com The world’s fastest-growing ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), is nearing $100 billion in assets, less than two years after its launch. That puts it among the 20 biggest ETFs, only 18 of which are in the $100 billion-plus club. It clearly shows demand for digital assets, or at least for one product. BlackRock dominates the crypto ETF category, with the next-biggest competitor, Fidelity’s Wise Origin (FBTC), being roughly a quarter of the size. Of course, BlackRock is also the world’s biggest asset manager, at about $12.5 trillion, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. The firm, which also manages the fourth-biggest crypto ETF, the $18 billion iShares Ethereum Trust, hasn’t shown any plans to expand into other digital assets. BlackRock declined to comment, but it has not been among the issuers filing for spot-price ETFs in XRP, Solana or other categories. “The ETF game belonged to BlackRock long before crypto ETFs,” said Tyrone Ross, CEO of 401 Financial and Turnqey Labs. “Everyone else gets the crumbs, and because the market opportunity is so big, other providers can accumulate meaningful AUM with those crumbs.” The iShares ETF, which charges 0.25%, brings in revenue of about $240 million for BlackRock, Bloomberg analysts noted, making it the most profitable fund for the company. There’s a big incentive for companies to add spot-price crypto ETFs, though the Securities and Exchange Commission until recently was slow to approve many. That changed last month, when the regulator gave exemptions to the three big exchanges to use generic listing standards. The effect will be numerous new digital asset ETFs coming to market without a la carte approval by the SEC. Whether there’s investor appetite for numerous versions of Dogecoin is another matter. “Other crypto tokens don’t have the same global adoption or characteristics that make Bitcoin such a strong store of value,” said Mike Casey, president of AE Advisors, who has been recommending Bitcoin allocations since 2019. “The spot ETFs are a frictionless way to add Bitcoin exposure for clients.” While IBIT has the most liquidity and largest market cap, he said the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) are also worth a look. Some of the recent developments in crypto ETFs: Let them eat crumb cake: There are billions of dollars in investments at stake, so expect a deluge of ETFs soon, even if only a small slice gain enough assets to survive. “The door is wide open now for other types of crypto ETFs,” Ross said. “It will be interesting to see how Solana is received and whatever comes after, like a Chainlink, Ripple or Litecoin.” As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. © 2025 The Daily Upside

The path to Wall Street has always been competitive — but these days it can be brutal. Aspiring finance pros are preparing as early as their first year in college to secure the internships that open the right doors. Business Insider asked its 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street, all at the top of their game at 35 or younger, what advice they'd give students who want to follow in their footsteps. They told us that for those who dream of M&A or making big investment bets, curiosity, persistence, and mentorship can make all the difference. We broke their advice into five key themes — plus tips on how to stand out once you land the job. Networking is important to any career, but in finance, it can pay to begin early. Mohini Chakravorty, a principal at private equity behemoth Blackstone, suggested starting in college, taking advantage of free time and a built-in network of alums, clubs, and career connectors. It's "the little things you learn from those conversations and research that really do clue you in as to what you like and what you don't like," the infrastructure investor told Business Insider. "To the extent that you can, narrow down the field. It just gets you closer to where you ultimately want to be." When looking for a connection, JPMorgan's Jack Levendoski said a little creativity and hustle can go a long way. He had a college sophomore send him a handwritten note with a reference to an "overlapping experience" they had in life. "It's hard sometimes to get the attention of people in my role, given how busy things are day to day," he said. Christian Woo, a managing director at Bank of America, said students should look inward, too. "Think about what you're genuinely interested in and passionate about," Woo, a quant strategist, said. Instead of taking the same classes as peers, finance hopefuls should instead pursue the "skills you want to build and what kind of function you want to be performing on a day-to-day basis," he said. When selecting a place to cut your teeth, Sarah Naylor, who works in investment-grade bond sales at Citadel Securities, suggests progress and growth over prestige. "Make sure that you are always somewhere where you are being challenged," she said. "Especially early in your career. Things like job title and pay can seem shiny and exciting at the time, but your knowledge is your biggest asset." Finance "is really a team sport," JPMorgan's Florian Plath said, so it's important to be around colleagues you like working with. "Meet as many people as possible because that's the only way where you can double-click and find that out," the M&A banker told Business Insider. "Everyone needs to find whatever fits best to their unique personality, their interests, and their strengths." Jake Woodson, Goldman Sachs' US head of distressed trading, agrees. "To get to the next level and perform at a high level for a decade or decades is hard to fake," the managing director said. "You need to be intellectually curious and passionate about it and the people." Finding the right crowd doesn't just help you land the job — it can shape your entire trajectory. An upperclassman on Alex Park's Columbia University squash team — who was heading into investment banking — became a major influence on his career journey. "He was instrumental in my ending up being able to get a banking job my senior year," said Park, a principal at Miami-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo. That experience, he added, shaped his belief that the easiest way to grow is to find someone you admire and emulate them. "When you see somebody who is doing what you want to do, who you really respect and look up to, and you can form a real relationship with them and they're able to pour things into you," he said. Nikunj Jain believes that his persistence, tenacity, and determination are what have differentiated him on his way to becoming head of Asia research at the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. "The biggest thing that's paid off for me personally has been just picking a thing and giving it your all," he said. "That mindset served me really well," Jain said, even when things don't work out as planned. "It's underrated, the ability to just show up every single day and take another swing in life and do it with consistency." Visualizing the big picture is also key to finding focus. Blue Owl's Lamar Cardinez suggests imagining the most exciting thing you could do at the peak of your career, and "then work backwards and really ask yourself if you currently have the skillset." It's that "critical" self-assessment that helped Cardinez — who started his career in business development at the National Football League — realize he wanted to move into sports investing. He's now doing that on Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners Fund, which invests in National Basketball Association's franchises. Once you're in the door is when the real work begins. One of the most repeated pieces of advice given by the rising stars we interviewed was to "be a sponge," as Natalie Lamberton, a director at Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR, said. For Patrick Kearney, a principal at private equity giant Apollo, said he's big on keeping a "learning mentality, being curious, and, at the right times, being skeptical. That means knowing how to ask the right questions." Aman Mittal, an investment banker at Moelis & Company, and Catherine Kress, chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, suggested getting the basics down. Know "the actual content of whatever you're doing," Mittal, a managing director, said. "Make sure that you know that very in and out." "If you do the really, really little things well, people will continue to trust you with the big things," said Kress, who took her new post in September. Madelaine O'Connell, a managing director at private credit firm HPS, a part of BlackRock, encouraged fresh recruits to focus on the task at hand and try not to "look around too much." Post-college, many, especially in investment banking, are already looking for the next job. This is especially common for those trying to get into private equity. "There's a lot within the four walls of investment banking or an asset manager, and a lot of mobility opportunities that if you work hard, you excel, you can do everything."

Title: Call for clarity on Ireland's data centre policy

Adam Maguire Business Journalist Tens of billions of euro of investment is being diverted to other countries due to uncertainty around Ireland's data centre policy, according to Digital Infrastructure Ireland. There has been an effective moratorium on new data centre connections since late 2021, while the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities is currently reviewing its policy on large energy users. DII has called for a firm timeline from the CRU on the publication of that policy - and says a fresh wave of investment is now at stake. "You cannot get a connection off the grid now from either ESB Networks, Eirgrid or Gas Networks Ireland," said Maurice Mortell, chairman of Digital Infrastructure Ireland. "We're still waiting for the CRU policy decision on large energy users to come out - we're four years now in a defacto moratorium on any new investments." As part of the National Development Plan, the Government committed €3.5 billion to upgrading and securing the energy network - key to addressing the current bottleneck in the system. Mr Mortell welcomed this, but said this did not resolve the uncertainty that persists. "I think it's welcome... I think the reality is, though, that's going to take time to deliver," he said. "If you look at the level of investment that we've lost over the past 12 months - billions of dollars of AI has gone into the UK, the Nordics, central Europe, the Mediteranian. "They're 10 year investments - we won't see that again for a while."

Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences Mr Mortell said that he accepted there were a number of factors that had to be considered - including the enviromental impact data centres have - but the lack of a clear policy was not benefitting anyone. "In order to look at a long-term strategy for Ireland, we need to have clarity around what is Ireland's renewable energy timeframe, what capacity are you going to bring onto the grid and how can our industry continue to develop and grow in Ireland," he said. A recent report by Blackrock said that data centre investment in Ireland had peaked, and was now growing at a faster pace in other countries. Ireland was an early leader in the area of data centres, but despite that Mr Mortell said it was not inevitable that it would eventually start to fall behind others. "Dublin wasn't the only big metro - there was Amsterdam, there was Paris, there was Frankfurt, there was London and they all went through similar growth to ours," he said. "It wasn't always that we were going to peak and then stop - we just didn't invest in the grid and the capacity at the right time. "All of the things that are coming through now was planned 10 years ago - it wasn't news to EirGrid or ESB Networks that there was going to be new capacity coming online."
