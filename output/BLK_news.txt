The cryptocurrency market in November 2024 showcased significant milestones, regulatory shifts, and industry trends. Here are the key takeaways: November 2024 marked a historic moment in the cryptocurrency market, driven by the increasing influence of U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). With inflows reaching $6.2 billion this month alone, these ETFs have significantly transformed Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. The shift from futures-based ETFs to spot ETFs signals greater confidence among institutional investors and provides a regulated, accessible pathway for traditional finance to engage with Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the cryptocurrency’s market price directly, eliminating inefficiencies caused by contango or backwardation in futures markets. The inflow of institutional funds has reshaped Bitcoin’s market dynamics: Source: Santiment Source: Farside Investors Source: Glassnode Bitcoin’s performance in November 2024 reflects the combined impact of macroeconomic forces and on-chain dynamics. With institutional confidence growing and on-chain activity reaching new heights, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency landscape. However, cautious optimism is advised as the market approaches the critical $100,000 milestone. November 2024 has been a month of technical milestones for Bitcoin, with bullish patterns forming on the charts. A key highlight is Bitcoin’s breakout from a multi-month ascending triangle, signaling strong upward momentum. This section analyzes the technical indicators that defined Bitcoin’s trajectory this month and explores potential scenarios for December. Whale accumulation: Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s technical performance in November underscores its bullish trajectory, with strong patterns and indicators supporting further upward movement. While challenges remain at critical resistance levels, the outlook for December remains optimistic, driven by both technical and on-chain factors. Ethereum has maintained its position as a leading blockchain network in November 2024, driven by record-high staking participation, significant contributions to the DeFi sector, and anticipation for its next major upgrade. These developments underscore Ethereum’s resilience and adaptability in a competitive crypto landscape. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) continues to strengthen, with staking metrics reaching new milestones: Source: Dune Analytics Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem, contributing to its robust performance: Source: DefiLlama Ethereum’s development roadmap remains a critical driver of its market sentiment: Ethereum’s price movements mirrored its strong fundamentals: Ethereum’s achievements in November 2024 highlight its leadership in staking, DeFi, and network development. With record-high staking participation, growing Layer 2 adoption, and a major upgrade on the horizon, Ethereum is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the blockchain ecosystem. November 2024 marked a defining moment for Solana (SOL), as it solidified its position as a leading altcoin through groundbreaking performance and ecosystem growth. With its price reaching an all-time high of $264, significant institutional interest, and surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency landscape. Source: DefiLlama Solana’s breakout performance in November 2024 underscores its potential as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. With record highs in price, trading volume, and ecosystem adoption, Solana is poised to redefine its role in the blockchain space. For market participants, aligning with its growth trajectory could yield substantial rewards in the months to come. Donald Trump’s re-election in 2024 has ushered in a pro-crypto agenda aimed at fostering innovation and regulatory clarity. This shift has bolstered the cryptocurrency market, driving institutional participation and expanding the scope of digital asset investment vehicles. A key development has been the wave of spot Bitcoin and Solana ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting the growing interest in regulated crypto products. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto governance is shaping the U.S. cryptocurrency market by fostering innovation, attracting institutional capital, and expanding investment opportunities. The influx of ETF filings, including those for Solana and Bitcoin, highlights the evolving landscape. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, the U.S. is poised to solidify its position as a global leader in digital assets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. In November 2024, AI-focused tokens surged in popularity, driven by partnerships, real-world applications, and increasing institutional interest. These tokens are bridging the gap between blockchain technology and AI, positioning themselves as key players in the Web3 landscape. Risk management: AI tokens are reshaping the Web3 narrative by bringing real-world utility to blockchain technology. As adoption grows across industries, these tokens have the potential to redefine how decentralized ecosystems interact with AI. For traders and investors, the focus should remain on projects with strong partnerships, innovative applications, and a clear regulatory roadmap. Blockchain gaming continues to solidify its role in the Web3 ecosystem, addressing criticisms of prioritizing profits over playability. November 2024 witnessed notable advancements as projects focused on enhancing gameplay experiences, while adoption metrics highlighted the sector’s resilience. This section explores key trends, case studies, and market performance within the blockchain gaming landscape. Blockchain gaming is undergoing a transformative phase, balancing profitability with meaningful player experiences. As projects innovate to address accessibility and retention, the sector’s potential to drive Web3 adoption becomes increasingly apparent. For market participants, staying aligned with evolving player preferences and technological advancements will be crucial. Blockchain is pushing the boundaries of what Play-to-Earn (P2E) models can achieve. In November 2024, AMBCrypto conducted an exclusive survey involving over 5,000 participants, shedding light on key challenges and opportunities in this growing sector. The findings reveal a shift in player priorities, with an increasing emphasis on playability and sustainable ecosystems. The NFT market in November 2024 continued its transformation from a speculation-driven space to one emphasizing real-world utility and innovation. While trading volumes declined by 15% MoM, projects focusing on functional NFTs gained traction, highlighting a shift in market priorities. Source: NFTGo The NFT market in November 2024 reflects a critical pivot toward sustainability and utility. As speculative interest wanes, projects delivering real-world benefits are poised to lead the next phase of growth. For investors and participants, focusing on functional NFTs and cross-chain innovations will be key to staying ahead in this evolving landscape.

UPDATED 10:16 EST / NOVEMBER 29 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof It’s time to get ready for Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, starting Monday in Las Vegas — the biggest cloud computing conference of the year. To prepare, check out our new Special Report: AI and the Cloud, with exclusive features, interviews and analysis, and all the important news starting next week. We take a deep dive into AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation, and also analyze the prospects for AI’s hottest new thing: agents, as well as the considerable challenges to their roll-out. In addition, theCUBE Research analyst John Furrier interviewed top AWS executives ahead of re:Invent, including AI and data chief Swami Sivasubramanian, enterprise solutions head Colleen Aubrey, developer experience VP Deepak Singh, and Dilip Kumar, head of Q for Business. We’ll have all the news next week from re:Invent keynotes and interviews, along with analysis from theCUBE Research and interviews on theCUBE. In other news this past week, big money continued to roll into cybersecurity as Halcyon raised $100 million and N-able acquired Adlumin for $266 million. TheCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante assessed his 2024 predictions. ChatGPT gave him an A-, but he gave himself a B. This week saw a mixed bag of earnings reports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but some significant guidance disappointments from Dell, HP, CrowdStrike and Workday weighed on stocks. Meantime, Pony AI’s IPO disappointed as well. Lots of earnings reports are coming next week too, among them Hewlett Packard Enterprise, UiPath, Salesforce and Zscaler. Here’s the news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Check out our newest special report on the intersection of cloud and AI, ahead of AWS’ annual re:Invent conference Dec. 2-6 in Las Vegas. As at just about every tech conference these days, AI will be the star. We’ll have all the news from re:Invent, plus exclusive interviews from theCUBE and analysis from theCUBE Research. First up is our deep dive into Annapurna Labs, Amazon’s accelerator chip operation in Austin, Texas: Amazon’s secretive AI weapon: An exclusive look inside AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation We took a deep dive into the promises and perils of agentic AI, which will be a prime topic at re:Invent — and just about every tech conference after that: Safety and reliability concerns temper agentic AI mania And a closer look at the challenges underneath the hype: AI agents are practical. Reliability is another matter John Furrier also interviewed the exec driving AWS into enterprise applications: Colleen Aubrey: Leading AWS’ bold path into enterprise solutions as well as VP of AI and Data Swami Sivasubramanian: Inside the AI revolution: Swami Sivasubramanian on generative AI, agentic systems and AWS’ vision. He also interviewed Deepak Singh, VP of Next Generation Developer Experience at AWS: Revolutionizing software development: Deepak Singh on gen AI, AWS Q Developer and the future of coding and Q chief Dilip Kumar on the coming golden age of business productivity: Transforming how business works: Dilip Kumar on Q for Business, gen AI and AWS’ vision for productivity Furrier will have more posts on his exclusive interviews with AWS execs ahead of re:Invent, in particular Sunday evening with AWS CEO Matt Garman.

Title: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Gains Momentum as Bank of America Raises Price Target to $75

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive “critical shock” for the country’s fiscal health. READ NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings The Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years. “The use of AI presents the rare — possibly unique — opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system”. While adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists’ outlook on AI and healthcare is “a mix of enthusiasm and despair”. “Enthusiasm because there’s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. … But there’s friction due to regulation, due to incentives — because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things — and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities”. In other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of AI systems. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is one of 2024’s best-performing AI stocks. On November 26, the company began trading on the NASDAQ exchange, reinforcing the company’s image as a strong force in the AI industry. This is because the NASDAQ is mostly affiliated with the tech sector. Following the shift, Bank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora has raised the price target for the AI darling from $50 to a street-high of $75 and maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock. Overall PLTR ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Exclusive | Jamie Dimon has been secretly communicating with Donald Trump on White House agenda for months: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/business/jamie-dimon-has-been-secretly-communicating-with-donald-trump-on-white-house-agenda-for-months-sources/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T14:24:18Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been communicating with Donald Trump in recent months through secret back channels, helping the president-elect hammer out a policy agenda before and since his decisive White House victory, The Post has learned. The 68-year-old Wall Street titan — who, like 78-year-old Trump, grew up in Queens in New York City — has acted as “a sounding board” for the incoming commander-in-chief’s economic manifesto, four sources close to Trump’s transition team said. One GOP insider said the president-elect’s inner circle held a series of “no-holds-barred conversations” with Dimon — who at the time was rumored to be eyeing a government job himself. “They have been speaking regularly for months,” said another GOP source briefed on the situation. Three of the sources close to Trump said the secret back channel focused on plans for cutting government spending, banking regulation, taxes and trade. A company insider added that Trump’s top aides set up the calls, which continued after the election, to “create a bit of daylight” between the two men and stop details of the exchanges leaking. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokesman also declined to comment. The quietly cozy relationship between Trump and Dimon has flourished despite the banker’s cryptic and tight-lipped tendencies when it comes to politics. Trump had floated Dimon’s name as a possible Treasury secretary pick in June and later claimed he had won his White House endorsement — despite a lack of any public statement from Dimon to that effect. Trump and Dimon also have continued to talk despite bouts of tension, including on Nov. 14 when the president-elect declared on Truth Social that Dimon ”will not be invited” to join his Cabinet. The banker promptly shot back: “I haven’t had a boss in 25 years and I’m not about ready to start.” The JPMorgan CEO, a registered Democrat who declined to back either candidate in the White House race, had even reportedly toyed with the idea of joining a Kamala Harris administration but then ruled himself out of leaving the Wall Street giant when her poll numbers tanked, The Post previously reported. On Nov. 22, The Post broke the news that Trump was also consulting with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, a major Dem donor, on policy issues. Nevertheless, the former” Apprentice” star’s admiration of Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase for nearly two decades and has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $2.6 billion, was described by one source as “a man crush.” Another individual close to the president-elect said Trump “greatly appreciated” it when Dimon, an avid reader of the New York Post, told CNBC in January the eventual election winner was “kind of right” to criticize illegal immigration and weak defense spending by America’s NATO allies. Dimon’s comments angered left-wingers within the Biden administration who then blacklisted Dimon from the White House in a fit of pique, as The Post exclusively reported. Two weeks ago, the JPMorgan boss said Trump’s threat of slapping tariffs on Uncle Sam’s major trading partners “will bring people to the table” if “done wisely.” Dimon, a vocal critic of current US banking rules, recently slammed the ‘onslaught’ of red tape drafted by Dem-backed regulators, launching a foul-mouthed tirade over a list of his most-hated pieces of legislation at a recent conference in New York, “It’s time to fight back…I’ve had it with this s–t,” Dimon told the stunned audience. The JPMorgan boss singled out regulations aimed at keeping banks resistant to financial storms by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets. The proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%. “Things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,” Dimon said on Oct. 28. Dimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million last year, urged the US government in his annual letter to shareholders last May to deliver “effective policy-making” issuing a warning that “a politician’s dream is a businessman’s nightmare.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said Trump’s second term as president will present “the biggest inflection point for banking regulation in three decades.” “This is Jamie’s vindication,” Mayo told The Post. “He is looking at all the bureaucracy and red tape and saying enough of the regulatory theater. It’s like banking with one hand tied behind your back” Mayo added that Trump potentially taking an ax to stringent banking rules “should mean borrowers get better rates for their loans and better services for customers.” The top analyst said: “It would be foolhardy for any administration not to hear Jamie Dimon out. Everyone should at least be consulting him for ideas.” The revelations that Trump has sought advice from a “kitchen cabinet” of Wall Street bigwigs comes after his appointment of staunch loyalist and hedge fund mogul Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. He has been hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach building his team for his new administration. Trump’s move to seek informal counsel from titans of American finance, who are outside his MAGA inner circle, could provide further reassurance to investors ahead of his second term in the White House that kicks off on Jan. 20.

Mountain View By James Franey, Charles Gasparino, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been communicating with Donald Trump in recent months through secret back channels, helping the president-elect hammer out a policy agenda before and since his decisive White House victory, The Post has learned. The 68-year-old Wall Street titan — who, like 78-year-old Trump, grew up in Queens in New York City — has acted as “a sounding board” for the incoming commander-in-chief’s economic manifesto , four sources close to Trump’s transition team said. One GOP insider said the president-elect’s inner circle held a series of “no-holds-barred conversations” with Dimon — who at the time was rumored to be eyeing a government job himself. “They have been speaking regularly for months,” said another GOP source briefed on the situation. Three of the sources close to Trump said the secret back channel focused on plans for cutting government spending, banking regulation, taxes and trade. A company insider added that Trump’s top aides set up the calls, which continued after the election, to “create a bit of daylight” between the two men and stop details of the exchanges leaking. Citigroup slashes banker promotions in cost-cutting drive: report A spokesperson for the Trump transition team declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokesman also declined to comment. The quietly cozy relationship between Trump and Dimon has flourished despite the banker’s cryptic and tight-lipped tendencies when it comes to politics. Trump had floated Dimon’s name as a possible Treasury secretary pick in June and later claimed he had won his White House endorsement — despite a lack of any public statement from Dimon to that effect. Trump and Dimon also have continued to talk despite bouts of tension, including on Nov. 14 when the president-elect declared on Truth Social that Dimon ”will not be invited” to join his Cabinet. The banker promptly shot back: “I haven’t had a boss in 25 years and I’m not about ready to start.” The JPMorgan CEO, a registered Democrat who declined to back either candidate in the White House race, had even reportedly toyed with the idea of joining a Kamala Harris administration but then ruled himself out of leaving the Wall Street giant when her poll numbers tanked , The Post previously reported. On Nov. 22, The Post broke the news that Trump was also consulting with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, a major Dem donor, on policy issues. Nevertheless, the former” Apprentice” star’s admiration of Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase for nearly two decades and has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $2.6 billion, was described by one source as “a man crush.” Fat cat Wall Street bankers set for bonus bonanza for first time in three years: study Another individual close to the president-elect said Trump “greatly appreciated” it when Dimon, an avid reader of the New York Post , told CNBC in January the eventual election winner was “kind of right” to criticize illegal immigration and weak defense spending by America’s NATO allies. Dimon’s comments angered left-wingers within the Biden administration who then blacklisted Dimon from the White House in a fit of pique, as The Post exclusively reported. Two weeks ago, the JPMorgan boss said Trump’s threat of slapping tariffs on Uncle Sam’s major trading partners “will bring people to the table” if “done wisely.” Dimon, a vocal critic of current US banking rules, recently slammed the ‘onslaught’ of red tape drafted by Dem-backed regulators, launching a foul-mouthed tirade over a list of his most-hated pieces of legislation at a recent conference in New York, “It’s time to fight back…I’ve had it with this s–t,” Dimon told the stunned audience. The JPMorgan boss singled out regulations aimed at keeping banks resistant to financial storms by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets. The proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER “Things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,” Dimon said on Oct. 28. Dimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million last year, urged the US government in his annual letter to shareholders last May to deliver “effective policy-making” issuing a warning that “a politician’s dream is a businessman’s nightmare.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said Trump’s second term as president will present “the biggest inflection point for banking regulation in three decades.” “This is Jamie’s vindication,” Mayo told The Post. “He is looking at all the bureaucracy and red tape and saying enough of the regulatory theater. It’s like banking with one hand tied behind your back” Mayo added that Trump potentially taking an ax to stringent banking rules “should mean borrowers get better rates for their loans and better services for customers.” The top analyst said: “It would be foolhardy for any administration not to hear Jamie Dimon out. Everyone should at least be consulting him for ideas.” The revelations that Trump has sought advice from a “kitchen cabinet” of Wall Street bigwigs comes after his appointment of staunch loyalist and hedge fund mogul Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. He has been hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach building his team for his new administration. Trump’s move to seek informal counsel from titans of American finance, who are outside his MAGA inner circle, could provide further reassurance to investors ahead of his second term in the White House that kicks off on Jan. 20.

Title: ‘Very Promising Start’: Top Analyst Says Ethereum Headed Higher Against Bitcoin – Here Are His Targets

A top analyst who accurately called the end of the 2022 crypto bull market thinks Ethereum (ETH) is poised to rally in both its Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) and US dollar pairs. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 826,200 followers on the social media platform X that ETH/BTC looks good after respecting its support at 0.30 BTC. According to the crypto strategist, ETH/BTC may bounce to as high as 0.4597 BTC. “Very promising start. Let’s see if we can get to the target.” At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0373 BTC worth $3,563. As for Ethereum against the dollar, Pentoshi thinks it is within the realm of possibility for ETH to surge above $4,000. “No reason this doesn’t challenge this year’s highs, or higher in my opinion. Which likely has confluence with the ETH/BTC target posted.” He also thinks that the rally will be driven by investors allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in capital to ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Starting to become more consistent for ETH. We could see a few $250-$500 million days at some point too in the near future for this [BlackRock ETH] ETF. Had a $91 million day just in the last week. Probability of that you have to assume is very high and not far stretched at all.” Pentoshi is also keeping a close watch on the native asset of the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network Render (RENDER). The analyst says RENDER looks bullish after flipping a key resistance level at $8.10 as support. “Was a very short wait, RENDER flipped it, retested, and confirmed on the four-hour [chart]. Structurally a great looking chart.” At time of writing, RENDER is worth $8.61, up over 8% in the past day.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him.

Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them! The picture was most probably generated. Even the HTTP link looks like a prompt: “a-butterfly-with-orange-and-black-wings-on-a-beige-background”. Looks like a photo of a gift shop trinket.

A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada.

Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W).

See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity.

Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Is there any evidence for that belief? “Xi sits in Beijing. In Moscow, Putin. In Washington, Trump is on the way. You can call them crazy guys. They don’t want good. Hope lies with von der Leyen in Brussels.” Absurd and offensive.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based. On checking novel’s origin , some stats in storyline: Set in mid 1999-New Years day 2000, World population ~7B (seemingly indicative of extreme overpopulation!) and NYC 34M. Food shortage driven by resource hoarding by rich is a major factor in social upheaval . Euthanasia becomes a protein source… Never gonna Happen! Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions. By Stephen Castle [ Seemingly explaining why Labour has shown no legislative interest in strengthening the public health service. No wonder why Jeremy Corbyn had to be expelled from Labour. ] It seems that rational people with increasingly painful, progressive and handicapping chronic illnesses which are not in themselves terminal will still be forced to commit suicide without the support of friends or family. Seems that Parliament is addicted to short measure The British legislation may be a first step. In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday.

A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

Title: Andy Farrell hoping Ireland have kept their best performance until last against Australia
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/29/andy-farrell-hoping-ireland-have-kept-their-best-performance-until-last-against-australia/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Whether the provinces see it this way or not is a moot point, but Ireland are in bonus territory this weekend with the addition of a fourth Autumn Nations Series game against Australia, or at any rate it will be very much a bonus if they keep their best performance until last against Joe Schmidt’s team. That is what Andy Farrell most wants before heading off on his sabbatical with the British & Irish Lions. “Our best performance of the autumn and maybe more, hopefully,” said the Irish head coach after announcing a side which sees the return of Hugo Keenan, James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park, Ronan Kelleher and James Ryan, as well as the retention of Sam Prendergast at outhalf. “That’s what you’re always wishing for, isn’t it, to progress? Australia are certainly progressing. We feel that the occasion, the importance of it, everything that we put on, trying to kick on in any type of series, is enough for us to see the best of ourselves.” Farrell loves maximising landmarks and there’ll be no shortage of them on Saturday at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm), what with Cian Healy reaching the Irish record of 134 caps off the bench and this game part of the IRFU’s 150th anniversary celebrations. “It’s huge, it’s a huge privilege for us all. We’ve Ollie Campbell coming in this evening (Thursday) presenting the one-off jerseys we’re going to use. They’re beautiful jerseys, aren’t they? Very nice,” added Farrell dutifully of the retro commemorative jerseys which went on sale this week and will be worn against the Wallabies. Campbell is the perfect fit, not only as a top bloke and great player, but he captained the Belvedere College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1972, while Healy was part of the 2005 Belvedere team which beat Blackrock to bridge a 33-year gap. “It’s a privilege for us because we talk about our history a lot in this type of position when it comes around on our shift. The 150th anniversary is a special place for us, and then you combine it with what’s happening there with Cian. “What a story, playing his debut 15 years ago against Australia,” said Farrell in reference to Healy’s debut in a 20-20 draw against Australia at Croke Park in November 2009. “It’s fitting for both the union and for Cian and his family. So (it is) a privileged-type situation for us all to be involved.” While the return of five frontliners was significant the retention of the 21-year-old Prendergast for a second successive start is the headline selection ahead of Jack Crowley, who has to be content with a return to the bench after starting all nine post-World Cup Tests prior to last week’s win over Fiji. Gus McCarthy has been preferred on the bench to Rob Herring, as is Craig Casey ahead of Conor Murray, while Peter O’Mahony and Garry Ringrose return to complete the ‘23′. While Prendergast’s selection was perhaps a less risky punt in the final game of a November window, Farrell saw this as a decision based on merit in the here and now. “This isn’t just throwing someone in and hoping to get the best out of it. I think he’s deserved it a little bit but also there’s obviously an eye on (the future). I suppose with the two young lads, this game won’t define them. It’ll be a good part of their development, and that’s what you’re hoping for.” Though one suspects both men are probably a tad weary of the narrative and line of questioning, Farrell said he welcomed the storyline of Schmidt returning to these shores for the first time as an opposing head coach. Praising what Schmidt achieved with Leinster and Ireland as “phenomenal”, Farrell added: “He’s the most successful coach in Irish rugby when you look at his time overall in Dublin. We’ve got a lot to thank him about, and I think it’s a nice story that we get to celebrate this game alongside him.” Farrell thanked Schmidt and David Nucifora for first hiring him as defence coach after the 2016 Six Nations and for the “privilege” of working with him. He also admitted that Schmidt’s “DNA was all over” the All Blacks’ World Cup quarter-final win when their assistant coach. “We’ve been here a little bit before, but when he comes back to these shores he should be celebrated for everything that he’s done for Irish rugby.” Farrell also spoke of cementing the foundations left by Schmidt and adding to them. “Whatever is good we keep cultivating that and keep allowing that to grow, and then I suppose you deal with things in a way that’s true to yourself, the direction of the game that you want to play, and the personnel that you’ve got to play it.” Farrell will miss next year’s Six Nations as well as a three-game summer tour to Georgia, Portugal and one more, but has compartmentalised both roles. “The only thing that drives me on is planning for the future of this team and that’s only been at the forefront of my mind, certainly over the last six months anyway.” Regardless of the result against Australia, Ireland will still be seeking to become the first country to win three Six Nations’ titles in a row next year, and Farrell understandably believes that passing the baton to Simon Easterby will ensure the smoothest transition. “We’ve been working together long enough now to agree on how this team needs to be driven forward. All our ideas over the years, that will continue. Simon is unbelievably diligent and the right man for the role in leading from the front. We’ve had the experience there and we’ve seen the credentials there, and we know it’s going to be a seamless one.” Ireland: Hugo Keenan; Mack Hansen, Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki, James Lowe; Sam Prendergast, Jamison Gibson-Park; Andrew Porter, Rónan Kelleher, Finlay Bealham, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris. Replacements: Gus McCarthy, Cian Healy, Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Peter O’Mahony, Craig Casey, Jack Crowley, Garry Ringrose. Australia: T Wright, A Kellaway, J Suaalii, L Ikitau, M Jorgensen; N Lolesio, J Gordon; J Slipper, B Paenga-Amosa, T Tupou; N Frost, J Williams; R Valetini, F McReight, H Wilson (capt). Replacements: B Pollard, A Bell, A Alaalatoa, L Salakaia-Loto L Gleeson, T McDermott, T Edmed, H Potter.

Title: Bitcoin surpasses 2015-2018 cycle – Is $100K ATH next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-surpasses-2015-2018-cycle-is-100k-ath-next/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T03:00:18Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has surpassed the 2015-2018 cycle, sparking more discussion about the potential for $100K. Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past a critical price milestone — surpassing key resistance levels that previously defined its cyclical behavior during the 2015-2018 bull market. This latest breakout highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing maturity in a market that has evolved significantly since its early speculative days. Unlike the dramatic peaks and valleys of the 2015-2018 cycle, Bitcoin’s current trajectory appears more measured, underpinned by stronger fundamentals and broader adoption. With its price now exceeding levels that many believed would act as insurmountable resistance, questions arise about whether this surge marks the beginning of a new bull cycle — or even a run toward a six-figure valuation. Bitcoin’s current cycle is progressing faster than its 2015-2018 counterpart. After peaking at $20,000 in 2017, Bitcoin took nearly three years to recover, consolidating at lower levels before its next bull run. In contrast, the 2022 bottom has been followed by a much quicker rebound, with Bitcoin surpassing $50,000 within two years — nearly a year faster than the previous recovery. Source: TradingView The chart shows Bitcoin maintaining momentum, with monthly RSI readings above 75 signaling strong bullish conditions. Trading volumes have also exceeded those from the earlier cycle, reflecting increased market participation. This milestone represents an 80% recovery from 2022 lows, supported by long-term holder accumulation and reduced exchange balances. These on-chain shifts highlight stronger fundamentals compared to prior cycles, suggesting less speculative activity and more sustained growth. Bitcoin’s accelerated recovery sets it apart from historical patterns. Two key factors define this cycle: institutional adoption and macroeconomic tailwinds. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pushing for Bitcoin ETFs, signaling mainstream acceptance and driving capital inflows. Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures has surged, reflecting heightened institutional activity. On the macroeconomic front, persistent inflation, geopolitical instability, and de-dollarization trends are bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge. Additionally, advancements like the Lightning Network have improved scalability, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility. These dynamics, absent in earlier cycles, are fueling stronger and more sustainable demand, positioning Bitcoin as a maturing asset in both retail and institutional markets. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s recent price movement, coupled with strong on-chain fundamentals, makes $100K a real possibility. Bitcoin surged past $90K in November, with a notable increase in trading volume and RSI hitting 75, suggesting robust bullish momentum. The correction that followed has seen Bitcoin hold steady around $95K, maintaining a healthy RSI of 65, indicating that the market is not yet overbought. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The ongoing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation concerns and growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, further support the bullish outlook. With supply constraints post-halving, Bitcoin’s path to $100K remains credible, though broader market volatility could still introduce risks.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Government on the hook for $115m, Nicola Willis seeks urgent advice

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The Government has $115 million at risk from the collapse of SolarZero. Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she was seeking urgent advice on the SolarZero situation. She had no further comment. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Société Générale. This morning, NZGF said: “A total of $365m from all lenders was available, but this was not fully drawn down at the point of SolarZero’s liquidation - and some had been repaid. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract. It quoted $177 for a four-person household. United States private equity giant BlackRock bought SolarZero from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price was not disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. At the time it went into liquidation, it had 15,000 customers (which it framed as 40% of NZ solar installations) and 160 staff. The debt facilities organised by NZGIF were designed to “allow SolarZero’s residential solar portfolio to increase to 20,000+ owner-occupied homes”. Meanwhile, a SolarZero staffer, who confirmed his identity and role to the Herald, says he asked management for figures on the amount owing to staff. He said 160 staff were told they had been terminated at a 4pm meeting on Tuesday, with no notice period or holiday pay offered. He said he had been told by a member of SolarZero’s executive team that about $1.4m was owing in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000. “Some of them are small operators and this could cause them to fold.” He described the sums involved - about $3.7m - as “chump change for a company like BlackRock”. He was planning to join a staff protest outside BlackRock’s Auckland office this afternoon - although he said he had fears for the turnout, given a number of those involved were on work visas. He said they feared being caught on camera by Immigration. The Herald put the staffer’s numbers to one of the liquidators, who did not immediately respond. The liquidators - Stephen Keen and Russell Moore of Grant Thornton - earlier indicated they would not comment until their first report, which is expected within five working days. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” NZGIF said in a statement on Tuesday that “NZGIF was informed today that SolarZero’s sole shareholder BlackRock has placed the company into voluntary liquidation”. This morning it added in a statement: “The liquidator’s initial report is due in the next few days. However, it may take some time to understand the final financial implications under a range of scenarios”. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category. Special meetings of unitholders of the Funds will be held on or about January 30, 2025, at which unitholders of record as at December 23, 2024 will be asked to approve the revisions. Further details of the meeting, including the proposed changes to the investment objectives and strategies, will be provided in an information circular to be distributed to unitholders of the Funds in advance of the special meeting. If approved, changes will be reflected in the Prospectus renewal filing of the Funds, which is expected to occur in late March 2025.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Uber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Over the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology. AI systems in these vehicles process data from LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to navigate roads, identify objects, and make decisions in real time.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

On November 27, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a post on publishing platform Medium that the tech industry was focusing on NVIDIA’s AI server and RTX 50 series supply chain. Per the analyst, Vishay, a semiconductor manufacturing firm, was the hidden winner of the focus. The analyst further added that Vishay had secured better-than-expected orders for NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers and RTX 50 series graphics cards. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his views on the future of the natural gas and oil sectors under President-elect Donald Trump's administration, alongside a majority Republican Congress. Cramer expressed his belief that companies involved in the natural gas ecosystem will thrive as a result of this new political landscape. He pointed out that the United States is rich in natural gas resources, which can be produced cheaply. While some may believe the country’s position in terms of natural gas production is lower than expected, Cramer noted that, due to the Biden administration’s unfriendly stance toward fossil fuels and a weaker global economy, the natural gas industry had underperformed for much of the year. However, Cramer is optimistic that this trend will soon shift. He emphasized that although the U.S. has vast natural gas reserves, there has been a lack of infrastructure to effectively transport the resource, a problem exacerbated by the Biden administration's resistance to new pipelines. This, according to Cramer, has hindered the industry. He specifically criticized the pause on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export authorizations, calling it a stunning setback for one of the country’s strongest sectors, which provides thousands of high-paying jobs. He went on to say: “The betting is that Trump's going to undo that on day one, giving new life to all these LNG projects that really have been stuck in limbo.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 13 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight Since the election, natural gas prices have surged more than 70%, although Cramer noted that this increase was partly driven by a cold snap after a warm fall and the delayed start to winter. “Seasonally, this is a good time for the commodity but I also think there’s some optimism about the future of the industry driving this move.” Cramer then shared his broader outlook, saying: “But here's the bottom line: We’re hearing about all sorts of Trump trades right now, and many of these things have made insane moves in less than three weeks, to the point where, actually, they’re feeling precarious to me.” He went on to recommend natural gas as a more sustainable investment, emphasizing that while many sectors have already surged in the wake of the election, natural gas stands out as an industry with long-term potential. Cramer believes that with the incoming administration’s supportive stance toward the fossil fuel sector, the natural gas ecosystem will continue to thrive for years to come. He suggested that investors should look to buy into producers, pipeline companies, and LNG export stocks, all of which he believes have further upside potential now that the regulatory environment has shifted. “I bet they keep running for the next couple of years, not months. They have all moved but they're nowhere versus where they could go now that Biden's anti-fossil fuel team has been broomed for one that is totally supportive of this industry.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during a recent episode of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of an oil and gas pipeline, spanning vast landscapes. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Cramer suggested that pipelines could be a strong investment for those anticipating a natural gas boom under Trump, including Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI), “Other than the producers, what works if you're betting on a natural gas renaissance under Trump… How about a pure play on pipelines? Much easier to build these under a Republican administration. There are plenty of good options here. I've been consistently bullish on Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan, they yield 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively.” Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is an energy infrastructure company, focusing on the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, petroleum products, and other commodities, along with CO2 production and related facilities. The company operates one of the largest natural gas transmission networks in the United States, holding an interest in or managing approximately 79,000 miles of pipelines and 139 terminals. It also oversees 702 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas storage capacity and generates about 6.1 Bcf of renewable natural gas annually, with another 0.8 Bcf in development. Additionally, the company transports more than 40% of the country’s natural gas production. The company has a strong project pipeline, with a backlog valued at $5.1 billion. According to Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) management, there are considerable growth opportunities in natural gas, particularly in areas such as LNG exports, cross-border exports to Mexico, power generation, and industrial demand. The company is currently involved in discussions about power opportunities that could exceed 5 Bcf a day, and its internal projections suggest an overall growth of approximately 25 Bcf a day in the natural gas market over the next five years. Overall KMI ranks 3rd on Jim Cramer's list of energy stocks for the Trump trade. While we acknowledge the potential of KMI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KMI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

It's always a good time to buy dividend stocks, but when the market is volatile, it's even more important.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks. Power needs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are expanding so rapidly that some data center campuses may use more electricity than entire cities, or even states, CNBC reports. Here is what Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers had to say about technology companies: "Technology companies are in a “race of a lifetime to global dominance” in artificial intelligence. It’s frankly about national security and economic security. They’re going to keep spending because there’s no more profitable place to deploy capital”. READ NOW: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News As such, it is important to note that renewable energy isn’t going to be enough to meet their power needs. According to developers, natural gas will also have to play a role. In turn, this need will slow down the progress towards meeting carbon dioxide emission targets. Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure, and power resources for such facilities, further reveals how data center companies have already begun operating at a scale where they have started “tapping out against the existing utility infrastructure”. In other news, Uber is reportedly building a fleet of gig workers for labeling data for AI models. The new data labeling division, known as Scaled Solutions, will have workers complete projects for the company's internal business units as well as serve outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to a report from Bloomberg. The ride-hailing company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the U.S., Canada, and India, among others.

Title: Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Fund Achieves 131,000% Lifetime Return
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/pantera-capitals-bitcoin-fund-achieves-131000-lifetime-return/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T15:16:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has revealed in a new post that its Patnera Bitcoin Fund’s lifetime return has recently topped 131,000% net of fees and expenses after the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged to near $100,000 after the US elections. In the post, Pantera Capital’s CEO Dan Morehead shared an email forecasting back in July 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at $65, that the “bitcoin washout happened” and predicting the price of the cryptocurrency would surge over time. The email notes he was going to “buy 30,000 bitcoins” with his own personal money at a time in which the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $740 million. Given the small size of the cryptocurrency market at the time, Morehead noted that in 2013-15, the fund “bought 2% of the world’s bitcoins.” To Morehead, buying Bitcoin at the time was like “buying gold in 1000 B.C.” as then “99% of the financial wealth has yet to address bitcoin.” He noted that the industry has made progress and now believes 95% of the financial wealth “has yet to put their full-sized position on.” The CEO added that the catalyst for the figure to keep on dropping has “just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States” at a time in which massive “institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. “ As a result, he predicted the price of Bitcoin will move to $740,000 per coin, up from its current level around $95,000. The surge would see Bitcoin’s total market capitalization hit $15 trillion, which to Morehead isn’t an inconceivable number relative to the $500 trillion in financial assets. Per his words if Bitcoin’s price growth were to continue it would hit the $740,000 mark in April 2028. Featured image via Unsplash.

Title: Bitcoin Well On Track To Hit $740,000 By April 2028 — Pantera CEO
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-well-on-track-to-hit-740000-by-april-2028-pantera-ceo/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T13:10:51Z
Full Content:
Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital — the first crypto fund in the United States — is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin could smash $700,000 in 2028, roughly a week after the flagship crypto rocketed toward a six-digit price. Despite Bitcoin’s astronomical growth in recent months, Morehead thinks it’s “still early” for BTC and that the cryptocurrency’s bull market has yet to run. Dan Morehead noted in a Nov. 26 blog post that 5% of financial wealth is now exposed to Bitcoin. Yet, that figure is set to increase with more regulatory clarity in the U.S. as pro-blockchain president-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House. This would result in faster institutionalization of Bitcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started a “massive transformation,” posited Morehead. “It’s [Bitcoin] already done three orders of magnitude,” Morehead wrote. He revealed that his investment company’s crypto-focused Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which was launched in 2013, has notched an over 131,000% lifetime return on its first Bitcoin purchase at $7. “Another one seems plausible.” Per the Pantera CEO, Bitcoin has been on a trendline that will push its value to roughly $740,000 by April 2028 (a nearly 670% growth from the current price point) if it continues its growth pattern. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was trading for about 2.3% higher at around $95,294 at publication time. “I just can’t help thinking that we still have many more years of very compelling returns.” $740,000 is “not an inconceivable number, relative to $500 trillion in financial assets,” he explained. At this price, Bitcoin would boast a market capitalization of a whopping $15 trillion. “I can imagine an investor thinking: ‘Bitcoin has doubled this year. Well, I guess I missed it,’” Morehead said. “That’s the wrong mindset.” Furthermore, Morehead told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Nov. 27 that he doesn’t think Bitcoin could ever crash to zero now as it has reached “escape velocity” with 300 million investors around the world owning it.

Status: Brought to market in April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €3.6 million. It was sold in September for €3.2 million, according to the Property Price Register (PPR). Architectural gems are my thing, and houses right beside the sea would also (imaginary budget allowing) most definitely be my thing. The Lake House in Howth is a place of absolute wonder, hemmed between its own lake and the endless stretch of Burrow Beach, which overlooks Ireland’s Eye. The back garden is knitted into the dunes, with specific decks on which to enjoy a tipple of your choice. It also has an outdoor terrace at the end of the extensive living area that faced west to catch sunsets; the roof of the terrace was carved in the shape of a keel, to honour the owner’s legacy of sailing. Inside, the living areas are well considered, with a long sittingroom graduating into a Snaidero kitchen. The house splits into two levels, with a study set between them on the landing. The views from The Lake House over the sea were staggering, and it was clear that the previous owner had loved every minute of living there. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: Listed in June 2024 at €1.75 million through Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes & Sherry FitzGerald Radford. Achieved in excess of its asking price, according to selling agent John Radford. It appears on the Property Price Register as having sold for €1.35 million in October 2024, which accounts for the house on one acre. The remainder of land, almost 27 acres, was sold separately. Situated along Wexford’s historic Norman Way, this Georgian residence dates all the way back to 1801. Though described on the National Built Heritage website as “a farmhouse”, the five-bedroom pile extends to a considerable 483sq m (5,198sq ft). Lying on almost 30 acres, the grounds have two paddocks, four stables and a hay barn likely to have attracted those who wish to entertain equestrian pursuits. In addition to its pristine condition, as owners who had lived there since 1997 had restored it fully to its former glory, there is a restored coach house, offering a large livingroom and games room. Add to this a 13m swimming pool and its proximity to a number of beaches and golf courses, along with access to fresh fish at nearby Kilmore Quay, and you can understand why it was on the market for such a short time. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: On the market through Sherry FitzGerald Catherine O’Reilly since October, seeking €695,000. Lynam Cottage has been my favourite house reviewed by The Irish Times this year, not just for its postcard-perfect exterior, light-filled interior and stunning surroundings, but for the fact that it introduced me to the story of its namesake – the author, journalist, linguist and administrator Joan (Shevawn) Lynam. Elizabeth Birdthistle’s research into Lynam, who bought and refurbished the cottage in the 1960s, painted a portrait of a fascinating woman who worked for Alfred Hitchcock, worked and wrote for various media outlets, and who was passionate about Basque independence and found herself banned from Spain for a time because of it. She put her knowledge of the region into a novel, The Spirit and the Clay, which she set during the Spanish Civil War. Lynam wrote her second book, Humanity Dick – a biography of eccentric TD Richard Martin – no doubt surrounded by the rolling Wicklow hills at the cottage. And today, following a thorough renovation by its current owners, Lynam Cottage is an idyllic retreat – the envy of writers and artists alike. It also incorporates some of my favourite interior features, such as a checkerboard floor at its entrance, skylights in the living areas and a window seat overlooking the countryside. Read our full review here. – Jessica Doyle Status: Brought to the market by Sherry FitzGerald seeking €10 million in September, and went sale-agreed that month, according to the selling agent. The selling price has yet to be confirmed, and it has yet to appear on the Property Price Register. Hidden away down a long driveway off Sandycove Avenue East, this very private period home on three-quarters of an acre of gardens that run down to the sea is a few minutes’ walk from the Forty Foot and Joyce Tower. The 594sq m (6,394sq ft) five-bedroom villa-style detached house, built in 1840, was effectively rebuilt and completely modernised over the past 24 years. Inside, it’s all bright, modern and warm (it has a B3 Ber), with rooms opening on to terraces that look over the formal gardens to the sea. A separate two-storey studio mews is accessed from Sandycove Lane.

It may seem obvious to choose a very large period property in Rathmines as the home that stood out for me in 2024, but it wasn’t the sheer size of it or the Dublin 6 address that impressed me most, it was how the house was lived in. This six-bedroom home, measuring 410sq m (4,413sq ft), is set out over three floors, with every corner in use. For the last 22 years it has worked around family life, so there were no rooms that were kept out of bounds for visitors’ eyes only. The ground-floor level adapted to every stage, from toddlers to teenagers. The reception rooms are both refined and relaxed, with the shuttered sash windows facing out to Brookfield Tennis Club. And the beauty of it all is that number 5 has not lost an ounce of its period charm along the way. Here’s hoping it goes to another family that will fill each room with life and love.

This semidetached end-terrace house was one of three Regency-style houses inspired by the developer Gerry Walsh’s love of the musical Oliver! and the famous Who Will Buy scene, set at a Regency terrace in Bath. To him, it symbolised beauty and harmony, and he sought to recreate homes with the same style and flair, taking years to assemble plots of land until he could build the terrace. Every corner, every space, every window and door was drawn and redrawn up to 200 times, and the meticulous attention to detail means every room, lobby and hallway works. The garden received the same exigent level of oversight, with each limestone slab on the patio individually chosen, pleached pear trees, and every bit of outside hardware, such as the downpipes, are of the highest quality. Walsh installed a Snaidero kitchen not just on the ground level, which has an open-plan kitchen, living and dining area and a pretty sittingroom to the front, but also in the utility room in the basement, along with a gym and home cinema. I particularly love the elegance of the stairs and its long mahogany banister running continuously over the house’s three floors.

Imagine the perfect weekend: your best friends are in Dublin to watch Ireland beat the All Blacks at the Aviva Stadium in Ballsbridge. After the match you repair to Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip’s pub The Bridge 1859 for a few celebratory scoops, followed by a steak dinner in Roly’s Bistro. Then it’s all back to your new abode at number 23 Elgin Road, where the party really gets started. This four-bed Victorian home in the heart of Dublin’s embassy belt, and done up to the nines by interior designer Jane Gilloway, is the perfect place for entertaining guests in style. You can put your friends and their families up in two luxury bedroom suites in the side extension, and in the two substantial detached modern mews houses at the end of the back garden. Gilloway has added plenty of showstopping touches to the elegant period home, including antique cast-iron radiators, Jacobean stained-timber floors and, in the kitchen/breakfastroom, Paonazzo honed marble worktops. With a spacious media room, pool table, fully equipped bar, wine room and integrated sound system, it offers all the ingredients for a marvellous party – and a luxurious lifestyle. Read our full review here. – Kevin Courtney Status: Brought to market by Sherry FitzGerald in June seeking €2.45 million. It went sale-agreed for over the asking price in August, says Michael Grehan of Sherry FitzGerald. An end-of-terrace Victorian five-bed with a pale pink exterior in an enclave of otherwise mostly redbrick homes off Rock Road, opposite Blackrock College, was at various times a school “for the education of young ladies”, a Protestant boarding house and also the home of a famous Irish bell-maker. It sold relatively quickly – overlooking Blackrock Park, the Dart line and the sea, its location was likely a strong selling point. Built in 1844, but Georgian in style, with bow windows and nearly floor-to-ceiling multi-paned new sash windows, Montereau had been modernised, with smart new bathrooms and kitchen – but there was still room to revamp the basement and a garage beside the house. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: Brought to the market in February 2024 with an asking price of €1.75 million. It was later listed at €1.5 million for auction, where it sold for €1.675 million according to selling agent Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty. This lovely two-storey, four-bay 260sq m (2,800sq ft) Victorian structure dates from 1895 and lies along one of the quietest roads in Sutton. It retains some unusual decorative embellishments of Indian accent, such as it ogee-headed arches to the veranda, as described on Fingal County Council’s record of protected structures. While its architectural origins have been lost to the annals of time, its Indian connection was presumed to be due to the fact that its first resident was a Dutch sea captain, with links to the Dutch East Indies and the East India Trading Company. And, although it would benefit from some upgrading, it has spectacular details such as elaborate window mouldings and striking cornicing. But what impressed most was its location, overlooking the sea with super views from rooms to the front. In addition, its southwesterly aspect allows for spectacular sunsets from these rooms, as the property is angled to maximise its expanse of views across Dublin Bay. It had been home to the Beshoff fish and chip family since 1978, until it sold earlier this year. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: For sale through Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since August, seeking €7.5 million. If you want to be lord of the manor in your own big estate, you usually have to head out to the countryside, but Tinnahinch is a classic country pile transplanted into the south Dublin suburb of Foxrock. This expansive Georgian-style home is built to the highest standards, with period features including Flemish bond facade, Portland stone sills and bespoke oak joinery. There’s a grand entrance hall and gallery landing, richly appointed reception rooms, spacious kitchen/diningroom and luxurious bedrooms. What really completes the idyllic picture is the 1.7 acres of lush gardens landscaped in the style of 19th-century Irish gardener William Robinson, who pioneered the move away from formal gardens to a wilder, more naturalistic style. The gardens are a magical mix of native and exotic plants, with winding paths, wooden bridges, tumbling waterfalls and serene lily ponds, with numerous spots to relax, read a book or dine al fresco.

Title: Crypto Oversight May Shift To CFTC Under Trump Administration: Report
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-oversight-may-shift-to-cftc-under-trump-administration-report/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T04:30:29Z
Full Content:
According to a report by Fox Business, citing sources familiar with the matter, the incoming Donald Trump administration may empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate certain crypto assets. With nearly two months remaining before Trump assumes the US presidency, the incoming Republican administration is already making strides toward fulfilling campaign promises, including creating a favorable regulatory framework for digital assets. The Trump administration is expected to significantly expand the CFTC’s role in overseeing the $3 trillion digital assets industry. This move could potentially scale back the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often faced criticism for stifling the growth of the digital asset sector by classifying most cryptocurrencies – apart from Bitcoin (BTC) – as securities. The SEC’s controversial “regulation-by-enforcement” approach has made the agency unpopular among US crypto industry participants. With the Biden administration ending, pro-crypto Trump’s incoming presidency signals a possible shift in Washington’s stance on digital assets. A recent ruling from a Texas court dealt a blow to the SEC by overturning its contentious broker-dealer rule. Sources suggest that the CFTC’s expanded role may include regulating digital asset exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies classified as commodities, such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, commenting on the matter, said: With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency. It is worth highlighting that Giancarlo is being considered for the nebulous “crypto czar” position under the Trump administration. According to the report, the new role is expected to “help execute crypto policy and potentially oversee an industry-led advisory council.” Beyond issues like immigration and trade tariffs, Trump’s campaign also focused on positioning the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” To support this vision, the president-elect is appointing regulators with moderate to positive views on digital assets. Asset managers like Bitwise and WisdomTree are optimistic that renewed interest in the digital asset industry could lead to the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for virtual assets such as XRP and Solana (SOL). Recent reports suggest that Trump’s transition team may create a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to tackle inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties. The idea has gained support from asset managers like BlackRock. Interestingly, similar efforts are underway globally. Brazilian federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced a bill to establish a national BTC reserve, aimed at diversifying the country’s treasury holdings. BTC trades at $94,784 at press time, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock in preliminary deal to buy private credit group HPS for $12 bln- FT

Investing.com-- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has entered a preliminary deal to buy HPS Investment Partners as the world’s largest asset manager looks to further grow its scope, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. BlackRock has a “handshake deal” with the firm, FT reported, with general terms of the deal to be announced after the Thanksgiving Holiday. A final price will be around $12 billion. HPS was considering an initial public offering that would have valued the firm at around $10 billion. The firm is one of the biggest private credit managers on Wall Street, and was founded by former Goldman Sachs employees in 2007. Wednesday’s report comes after BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion buyout of Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this year, the company had acquired UK data firm Preqin for around $3.2 billion. The asset manager is seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing private credit sector, given that alternative assets offer much more lucrative fees than traditional markets.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/27/2024 3:24:51 PM PST by george76 Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and Vanguard Group, three of the largest institutional investors in the world, for conspiring to artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices. Over several years, the three asset managers acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States, thereby gaining the power to control the policies of the coal companies. Using their combined influence over the coal market, the investment cartel collectively announced in 2021 their commitment to weaponize their shares to pressure the coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals. To achieve this, the investment companies pushed to reduce coal output by more than half by 2030. Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street utilized the Climate Action 100 and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative to signal their mutual intent to reduce the output of thermal coal, which predictably increased the cost of electricity for Americans across the United States. These firms also deceived thousands of investors who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits. Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” A coalition of 10 other States joined Attorney General Paxton on the lawsuit. The Buzbee Law Firm and Cooper & Kirk are serving as outside counsel.

These firms also deceived thousands of investors who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits. Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.

Crypto isn’t in the depths of a bear market, and your cousin doesn’t think you’re a crook anymore. Now crypto is ascending again—and everyone wants financial advice, just like Thanksgiving from three years ago. Below is a compiled list of handy talking points for your crypto-curious relatives, covering the industry’s most significant, recent developments. Stick to the facts, avoid shilling meme coins to the elderly, and you’ll be cruising to pie in no time. Bitcoin came within a few hundred bucks of the vaunted $100,000 milestone last week, and while the price has retreated a bit recently, it returned above $97,000 earlier Wednesday. What’s driving the demand that’s pushed Bitcoin’s price record in recent weeks? Institutional and retail investors have expressed optimism that there will soon be a more favorable regulatory climate for digital assets in the U.S. That’s thanks to the victory of self-proclaimed crypto enthusiast Donald Trump, along with the election of the most pro-crypto Congress to date. Meanwhile, institutional investors’ forays into spot Bitcoin ETFs have also given traders reason to be optimistic, pumping up the price of Bitcoin over the year. In short, Bitcoin is more “legit” than ever in the eyes of Wall Street and politicians. Your folks may have heard that BlackRock and Fidelity—which may be managing their pensions—are now involved in Bitcoin. What are these two Wall Street giants doing with crypto? Well, you can explain: They swallowed the orange pill. OK, so you probably don’t need to use Crypto Twitter jargon. Still, you can tell them that traditional finance bigwigs now offer exposure to the two largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Thanks to long-awaited SEC approvals this year, top fund managers who manage different ETFs now let ordinary investors buy shares that track the price of the two via brokerage accounts. Even your technophobic aunt can down the orange pill with a couple of taps on her phone. On the campaign trail this year, Trump made lots of promises about lots of things, including crypto. And while it remains to be seen whether he will live up to many of those commitments, signals are already indicating that he may be holding up the crypto end of the bargain—which could be a massive development for the industry. First things first: last week, the president-elect nominated Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary. Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has indicated he’d back Trump’s proposal to establish a Bitcoin federal reserve. The plan would see the U.S. buy billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to diversify its reserves. Think of it this way: If your uncle says Bitcoin has no real value, you might soon be able to tell him the U.S. government backs the asset. Pair that with Trump’s plans to unwind the SEC’s aggressive crypto crackdown completely, plus his oath to get the Republican-controlled House and Senate to approve laws that would firmly legalize most crypto activity swiftly, and it’s no wonder crypto has exploded in recent weeks. Experts say the market still has much, much higher to climb in the coming months, too. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, now has a role in Trump’s government: The Tesla CEO will lead the Department of Governmental Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) with billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to supposedly clear up the bureaucracy. What’s that got to do with crypto, though? Well, the new department’s acronym matches the ticker of Dogecoin, the original and most meme coin. That’s probably not a coincidence. Elon Musk has for years spoken—and tweeted—about how it’s his favorite coin. This earned him the “Dogefather” title on Twitter, now called X, after he acquired the platform. While we can’t be 100% sure of the naming origins, Trump is selling a DOGE-themed t-shirt featuring himself, Musk, and a Shiba Inu—the mascot of Dogecoin. Don’t want to decide between Bitcoin or Ethereum? If you’d instead launch your own token, you can now do it much more efficiently than ever. One of the most significant innovations from the most recent crypto cycle has been the creation of token launchpads, or platforms that allow anyone to near-instantly create a token with a few clicks and for a few cents worth of crypto. The most notable launchpad, Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform, has given rise to some of the most memorable tokens from this cycle. Nearly four million tokens have been created on Pump.fun this year, ranging from animal tokens that have provided early traders with significant riches to those launched by crypto-curious celebrities like musician Iggy Azalea. Crypto’s adoption barriers keep getting knocked down. Consumers now have a wide breadth of mobile app options to buy, sell, and interact with a variety of platforms. Plus, the rise in smart wallets, which drastically simplify the onboarding process, is making it easier to get those previously intimidated by the technical complexities of crypto to participate on-chain. With the launch of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, those looking to gain crypto exposure have more traditional financial options. That option didn’t exist in the U.S. last Thanksgiving. Are you looking to dive head-first into crypto? Not so fast—you’ll first want to get your sea legs. The crypto industry is rife with scams, and a seemingly innocuous link to an airdrop could lead you to a wallet drainer: Say goodbye to all your coins! Even if you manage to keep your crypto out of scammers' grips, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to keep your holdings from going to zero. Not many people make money trading crypto, and much fewer are getting rich off of it. Up to 80% of day traders lose money over time, according to a report published in The Journal of Finance. It’s still incredibly easy to lose your shirt in crypto, whether by clicking a malicious link or betting on highly volatile coins. For newcomers, you’re probably best suited to sticking to the most significant coins via apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, Cash App, or buying into ETFs. Want to go deeper? Be very careful—you’ll be thankful in the long run.

Title: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): Hedge Funds Boost Holdings Despite Nasdaq Delisting Risk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Should Not Ignore. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other AI stocks. Even as the United States pursues a tougher trade policy towards China, the latest indication being the tightening of export restrictions on advanced AI chips, companies from the Asian country continue to debut on the US stock market with elevated investor interest. For example, Pony AI, a China-based autonomous vehicle technology company, recently held an initial public offering that saw shares jump 15% in the market debut, pushing the valuation of the firm to more than $5.25 billion. News agency Reuters reports that the successful debut also suggested a positive investor approach to China-based firms.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Semiconductor Penny Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) stands against the other semiconductor penny stocks. With the age of artificial intelligence having made an indelible mark on the stock market, semiconductor stocks have been thrust into the spotlight. While it's typically the stocks at the top of the semiconductor food chain, such as the AI GPU designer whose shares are up 740% since ChatGPT was made public or the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer responsible for making AI GPUs or processors for Apple, that catch the media and public attention, the semiconductor industry is made of a plethora of other firms as well. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry comprises firms upstream and downstream of the chip supply chain. Starting from the former category, these semiconductor stocks start from those that provide design intellectual properties and hardware used to manufacture chips. Moving further downstream, semiconductor fabrication firms such as the Taiwanese firm whose American Depository Receipts (ADRs) have gained 133% since ChatGPT's public unveiling started to play a role. Finally, the downstream chip supply chain is made of designers who sell the products and others who assemble chips into the hardware needed for their proper functioning. To invest in semiconductor stocks, an investor needs to know which supply chain category a stock belongs to. This is because industry dynamics often have a varying effect on stocks at different rungs of the supply chain. Additionally, when we talk about downstream stocks, then the markets that they cater to also play a role in the share price performance. Stocks that are upstream are affected by broader industry trends and find it difficult to benefit from sector-specific tailwinds such as artificial intelligence. As an illustration, consider the performance of three upstream semiconductor stocks. The first stock ranks 7th on the list of 15 AI stocks shaping Wall Street, the second is 19th on Goldman Sachs' list of top growth investors, while the third ranked 12th and was losing popularity among institutional investors according to Bank of America. The first two stocks are up 16% and 4% over the past twelve months while the third is up by a more modest 1%. Compared to the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index, a widely followed industry benchmark that has gained 32.2% over the same period, all three semiconductor stocks have underperformed. A brief look at the three stocks' business model sheds light on the reasons behind their lackluster performance. Starting from the worst stock whose shares are up by 1%. The firm provides semiconductor manufacturing equipment such as those used in wafer cleaning, etching, and film deposition. This means that it has exposure to the broader and non-AI sectors of the downstream semiconductor industry as well. Additionally, during its fiscal year 2024, 42% of the firm's revenue came from the memory industry. These chips run parallel with integrated circuits in computers, and their demand has been depressed recently and only started to recover in mid-2024. It also has exposure to China, and semiconductor tensions between the US and China haven't boded well for the stock either. Similarly, the semiconductor stock that is up 16% over the past year also has notable exposure to China. During the nine months ending in July 2024, 40% of its revenue came from China. Yet, for the three months ending in July, this percentage dropped to 32% as US government restrictions against American chip firms from supplying products to China continued to affect it. This semiconductor firm provides products such as plasma abatement systems, epitaxy systems, film deposition systems, and etching masks. As a result, even if there are no US-Chinese tensions, the fact that China's economy and industrial production have slowed naturally reduces the demand for its products. On the downstream end of the semiconductor supply chain, there is a clear bifurcation between AI and non-AI stocks, or those with exposure to integrated circuits and GPUs, and those with no exposure. To understand how to consider two stocks of firms that manufacture semiconductors. The first is the Taiwanese firm which we've mentioned above. Its ADRs are up 87.2% year-to-date. The second ranks 16th on our BofA list shared above, and its shares are down 14.5% year-to-date. Starting from the former, during the third quarter, 51% of the firm's revenue came from high-performance computing (HPC) products. These chips are involved in data centers, enterprise computing, and other workloads, and they also have wide exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. This firm also manufactures AI GPUs for Wall Street's favorite GPU designer, and the culmination of its end markets coupled with the fact that its 3-nanometer manufacturing process is an industry leader has seen investor optimism surge surrounding its fortunes. On the flip side, the semiconductor stock whose shares are down 14.5% has little exposure to HPC and AI chips. As of H1 2024, 53% of the firm's $3.7 billion revenue came through products that it sold to the automotive industry. This firm is known for selling chips manufactured through silicon carbide. These chips are used to manage power in electric vehicles, and as EV demand has slowed down in 2024, investors have fled the stock in response. The semiconductor stock hasn't been helped by the fact that slowing industrial activity led to a 21% industrial revenue drop during H1. As should be clear by now, semiconductor stocks come in all flavors. One such flavor, when analyzing them through share prices, is the penny stock segment. These stocks belong to smaller companies that do not have sizable revenue to power their valuation. Yet, penny stocks, when prudently considered, also often have the chance for stronger returns due to their low prices. On the flip side, these stocks are prone to market manipulation, and since they're not as frequently covered by analysts or the media, understanding the fundamental drivers of their share price is complex. With these details in mind, let's take a look at some semiconductor penny stocks. Our Methodology To make our list of the best semiconductor penny stocks, we ranked semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks under $5 by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a technician's hands working on an advanced semiconductor substrate. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 10 AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is an upstream semiconductor firm that primarily makes and sells substrates. These products are used to manufacture chips on them, and AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s substrates revolve around communications, solar, robotics, and other associated applications. The stock has been on quite a ride this year. It fell by 37% in April after a research report alleged that the firm was facing tight financial conditions. AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s shares continued their downward momentum in November, as they fell by another 18% following a third-quarter revenue miss. While the firm raked in $23.6 million in revenue during Q3, analysts had expected it to bring in $25.5 million. Even though AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) is based in California, 99% of the firm's long-term assets are in China. Additionally, 50.6% of the firm's H1 2024 revenue came from the East Asian country, which creates a double-edged sword. While AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI) can benefit from renewed Chinese focus on its domestic industry, the firm might also be caught in the crosshairs of geopolitical tensions between the US and China. AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXTI)'s management shared details about the state of its Chinese market during the Q3 2024 earnings call: "Overall, the market recovery is somewhat lumpy, particularly given the weak economic conditions in China. But new fiscal stimulus in China announced in September could provide a catalyst for a truly market environment. This will benefit demand across a broad based of applications, including power amplifiers, HPT applications for wireless switches, high-speed power industrial labels, and LEDs. We continue to be encouraged by our relatively new traction in HPT applications by bringing the learning from our product that’s advancing in our 8-inch gallium arsenide development to our 6-inch gallium arsenide wafer production." Overall AXTI ranks 5th on our list of the semiconductor penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AXTI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

More Info The FBI has been investigating a longtime Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) consultant over the contractor's alleged role in a hack-and-leak operation that targeted emails by environmentalists critical of Exxon Mobil’s role in climate change, Reuters has reported exclusively. The multi-year operation involved hackers who breached email accounts of environmental activists and others. The scheme allegedly began in late 2015, when U.S. authorities contended that the names of the hacking targets were compiled by the DCI Group, a public affairs and lobbying company working for Exxon at the time. For years, Exxon Mobil has been a target for climate activists. Two years ago, the company lost three board seats to Engine No. 1, an activist hedge, in a stunning proxy campaign. Engine No. 1 demanded that Exxon needs to cut fossil fuel production for the company to position itself for long-term success. "What we're saying is, plan for a world where maybe the world doesn't need your barrels," Engine No.1 leader Charlie Penner told the Financial Times. Engine No. 1 enjoyed a stunning victory thanks to support from BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and State Street who all voted against Exxon’s leadership. However, the backlash against Big Oil has faded in recent years even as the countries everywhere rush to beef up their energy security. In 2022, Exxon recorded a major victory after its shareholders supported the company's energy transition strategy at the annual general meeting. Only 28% of the participants backed a resolution filed by the Follow This activist group urging faster action to battle climate change; a proposal calling for a report on low carbon business planning received just 10.5% support while a report on plastic production garnered a 37% favorable vote. Following in the footsteps of its larger peer, Chevron Corp.(NYSE:CVX) shareholders likewise voted against a resolution asking the company to adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, indicating support for the steps the company already has taken to address climate change. Just 33% of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal, according to preliminary figures disclosed by the company, a sharp turnaround from last year when 61% of shareholders voted to support a similar proposal.

Title: Gensler Exit Signals End To Climate Reporting Rule And ESG In The SEC
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2024/11/27/gensler-exit-signals-end-to-climate-reporting-rule-and-esg-in-the-sec/
Time Published: 2024-11-27T19:19:11Z
Full Content:
Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following a Financial ... [+] Stability Oversight Council meeting at the Treasury Department in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, May 10, 2024. Photographer: Samuel Corum/Bloomberg Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saw a wave of regulatory and enforcement actions relating to environmental, social, and governance; sustainability; and climate change. Gensler’s resignation as Chair of the Commission not only signals a new direction for the agency but will most likely result in many green initiatives being rolled back. The result will frustrate climate activists but may give U.S. businesses a strategic advantage in the global market. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions. On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. A series of companion rules and initiatives were also implemented during the same period. The SEC created a Climate and ESG Enforcement Task Force in March 2021 to “develop initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct.” The SEC quietly disbanded the Task Force in September 2024. In April 2021, the SEC Division of Examinations issued a Risk Alert relating to ESG. The Division conducts exams, their terminology for reviews of SEC filings of publicly traded companies and investment funds for compliance with regulations. They also issue periodic Risk Alerts making companies aware of areas of focus and concern. The April 2021 alert showed a new focus on ESG and stayed an annual priority until 2023, when it was quietly omitted. It returned in a November 4 Risk Alert that addressed ESG claims made by funds. This aligns with the Names Rule, amended in September 2023, to take into consideration ESG. Under the rule, funds with phrases related to environmental, social, or governance factors, including climate and sustainability, will be forced to align 80% of the investment with those names. This is most likely the reason why ESG was removed from priorities in 2023 and is now reemerging, as it gave funds time to adjust to the new rule. In 2024, the SEC penalized a number of high-profile funds for failure to comply with the rule. Under Gensler, the SEC has also introduced other initiatives relating to ESG, including a focus on the composure of boards and internal policies. The future of these initiatives is in question with Gensler’s exit. Traditionally, the Chair of the SEC tenders their resignation following a presidential election, even when they have time left in their term. This allows the incoming administration the ability to make their own selection for the role. As expected, Gensler, a Democrat that served under Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Biden, submitted his resignation on November 21, effective the end of Biden’s term. With Gensler’s exit, there will be a notable shift in priorities for the incoming chair. At the Workiva Amplify Conference in September, David Peavler, a former attorney for the SEC and current partner at Jones Day, addressed the impacts of the then potential change. He stated he believes that the Trump Administration will either drop or repeal the climate rules. Looking at the overall direction of the SEC, he believes there will be shift away from new initiatives and rulemaking, as has been the case under Gensler, and a refocus on enforcement. While ESG was a still relatively unknown concept during Trump’s first term, the Department of Labor did take action to limit its impact. In 2019, the DOL issued a rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that found the consideration of ESG by fund managers was a violation of their fiduciary duty. The Biden Administration partially reversed the DOL ERISA opinion in 2021, stating that ESG may be considered as a factor, but only as a tiebreaker if both investment opportunities offer identical returns. Expect a similar approach under the next Trump Administration. The next SEC chair will most likely methodically undo the ESG and climate related reporting standards imposed under Biden and Gensler. The SEC will refocus on traditional financial consideration, effectively killing ESG at the national level. Although, companies will still have to comply with international regulations and state level requirements. This may give U.S. businesses a strategic advantage in the global market. Concerns have been rising in the European Union that their corporate sustainability reporting requirements are harming the EU economy. Following the June 2024 Parliament elections, the incoming leadership has stated their intent to reduce the “regulatory burden” on businesses, including consolidating three key pieces of climate related regulations. Other jurisdictions have imposed costly reporting requirements under the IFRS Sustainability Standards. Climate activists argue the the costs are not only worth it, but are necessary to reduce the impacts of climate change in a shift towards a “climate economy.” However, the Trump administration has stated clear opposition to the concept and business as usual. The removal of the SEC sustainability/ ESG focus will allow U.S. businesses to continue to focus entirely on profits, giving them a competitive edge, at least in the short term. One Community.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/27/2024 10:29:08 AM PST by DFG A groundbreaking lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accuses financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street of colluding to manipulate the U.S. coal market. The case, spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and supported by 10 other state attorneys general, alleges that these firms have used their substantial ownership stakes in major coal producers to suppress competition and artificially raise energy prices. The states listed as plaintiffs are” Texas Alabama Arkansas Indiana Iowa Kansas Missouri Montana Nebraska West Virginia Wyoming According to the 108-page complaint, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street collectively hold controlling stakes in multiple coal companies, including Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, which account for significant portions of U.S. coal production. The suit alleges that these firms formed an “output-reduction syndicate,” leveraging their shareholder influence to force coal companies to cut production, ostensibly in alignment with environmental goals like the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. The complaint details how these firms’ actions have allegedly suppressed coal supply despite rising demand for electricity. The result? Skyrocketing coal prices and increased costs for consumers at a time when many are already grappling with inflation. (Excerpt) Read more at thegatewaypundit.com ...

Title: BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard sued by GOP states over ESG goals
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/business/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-sued-by-gop-states-over-esg-goals/
Time Published: 2024-11-27T17:10:55Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard have been sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that resulted in reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. Wednesday’s complaint filed in the federal court in Tyler, Texas, is among the highest profile lawsuits targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals, or ESG. The defendants were accused of exploiting their market power and involvement in climate advocacy groups to pressure coal companies to slash output and reduce carbon emissions from coal by more than 50% by 2030, driving up consumers’ utility bills. “Competitive markets — not the dictates of far-flung asset managers — should determine the price Americans pay for electricity,” the states said in the complaint. Larry Fink’s BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard together have more than $26 trillion of assets under management. None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment. The 11 states also include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. Republicans have long explored using US antitrust laws to target alleged collusion among large fund managers to advance climate-related goals. Climate advocates, in contrast, view assessing environmental risks as essential to assessing what investments are worth. The states objected to BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard allegedly pressuring coal companies for change starting in 2021. They also criticized the defendants’ membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which says members are committed to complying with all antitrust laws, and BlackRock’s and State Street’s membership in Climate Action 100+. Vanguard left the Net Zero initiative in 2022, while BlackRock and State Street left Climate Action 100+ in February. But the states said the withdrawals did not negate the “ongoing and future threat” of continued pressure. It cited the defendants’ investments in nine coal companies, including combined respective stakes of 34.2% and 30.4% in Arch Resources and Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded UuS coal producers. BlackRock was also accused in the lawsuit of “actively deceiving” investors about its non-ESG funds by promising to dedicate them to enhance shareholder value, when it allegedly used all its holdings to advance its climate goals. The lawsuit seeks to block BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard from using their investments to vote on shareholder resolutions and take other steps that could undermine coal output and limit market competition. It also seeks civil fines for violating federal antitrust and Texas consumer protection laws.

Hou is also suing TuSimple and his former co-founder Mo Chen, the company’s chief producer and director, to confirm that a 2022 voting agreement granting Chen control over TuSimple expired in November 2024, which Hou says would revert his voting rights back to him. Hou has even created a website, SaveTuSimple.com, to raise awareness about his campaign to liquidate TuSimple and return cash to shareholders — which include Traton Group, BlackRock, and Vanguard. The site states that as of November 26, TuSimple’s stock trades at $0.24 per share, while holding $1.93 per share in cash alone. It advertises that through liquidation, TuSimple shareholders “can immediately realize this 700%+ premium to current market price.” The letter, lawsuit, and campaign are the latest flare-ups in an ongoing fight between TuSimple and some of its shareholders, which include Hou, over the company’s attempts to send its remaining assets to China. Before shuttering its U.S. operations and delisting from the stock market earlier this year, TuSimple was a pre-revenue company, so any cash it has today would have come from investors. Hou and other shareholders have accused TuSimple’s leaders of diverting assets toward animation and gaming businesses linked to Chen, framing it as a business pivot. After shareholders raised concerns of self-dealing in an August letter to the board, TuSimple surprised many by unveiling a new AI-generated animation and gaming unit. Earlier this month, Hou urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order on TuSimple to stop the company from transferring U.S. assets to China as part of an existing shareholder lawsuit. Hou said he was galvanized to action after noticing filings that he says signaled TuSimple was preparing to transfer large sums of money to China. TuSimple has fought back against Hou, bringing up its own litigation alleging trade secrets theft after Hou launched his autonomous trucking startup, Bot Auto, in Texas last month. “As a founder who invested seven years building TuSimple Holdings Inc. and its largest shareholder, it has been disappointing to watch shareholders’ collective investment value plummet by over 91% in less than two years under the leadership of Mo Chen … and Chairman and CEO Cheng Lu,” Hou wrote in the letter, which he sent to the board on Monday. Hou filed suit against TuSimple and Chen last week in the Delaware Chancery Court, which is known to be friendly to shareholder rights. In the filing, he also asked the court to postpone TuSimple’s upcoming annual shareholder meeting, which is currently scheduled for December 20, to “prevent the implementation of proposed significant governance changes before the voting rights dispute is resolved.” Sources familiar with the matter say Hou wants time to solicit proxies to get more investors on his side. Aside from Hou and Chen, TuSimple’s largest shareholder, with an 11.8% stake, is Sun Dream, an affiliate of Chinese conglomerate Sina Corporation, an investment that brought scrutiny from federal regulators. The remaining large shareholders are Logistics giant Traton (7.6% stake); Vanguard Group (6.1% stake); BlackRock (5.6% stake); and Camac Partners (5.5% stake). Camac has also written to urge the board to keep TuSimple’s funds in the U.S. The other three investors did not respond in time to TechCrunch to comment. But before Hou can convince shareholders to back him, he’ll need to get control over his own shares, which are the subject of his lawsuit. In the fall of 2022, a probe from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States led TuSimple to reveal that its employees spent paid hours in 2021 working for Hydron — Chen’s hydrogen trucking startup based in China — and shared confidential information with the company. As a result, Hou was ousted from his posts as CEO, president, and CTO, and from his position as chairman of the board, though he retained a seat on the board. Hou has maintained that the firing was done without just cause. He and Chen were concerned that the board was engaged in a power grab that wasn’t in TuSimple’s best interest, so they discussed combining their voting powers to reinstate Chen on the board and bring Hou back as CTO after an internal investigation about the Hydron allegations. (Hou never got his CTO post back.) On November 9, Hou signed an agreement with Chen that would give the latter “irrevocable proxy and power of attorney” over Hou’s shares in TuSimple: Around 13.4 million shares of Class A common stock, and 12 million shares of Class B common stock. Put together, Hou’s shares would account for 29.7% of TuSimple’s total voting power. The agreement, which TechCrunch has viewed, expired after two years. Hou says this means the shares should revert back to him. But Chen has other ideas. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated November 9, 2024, Chen reaffirmed his claim to Hou’s shares, stating that he controls 57.9% of the company’s voting power. The filing also states that while the irrevocable proxy indeed terminated, “the voting agreement, and the voting arrangement thereunder, remain in full force and effect.” In other words, while Hou may be in possession of the shares, he still needs to vote as Chen directs. (It’s worth noting that since voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January, TuSimple has failed to file quarterly updates, which are required for a company that is still registered with the SEC. TuSimple is also attempting to deregister from the SEC.) TuSimple included similar language around the deal with Hou in its proxy statement to shareholders ahead of the upcoming annual meeting, during which they will vote on renewing the six current directors and whether to create a classified board, or a staggered board. Half of the board’s current makeup is TuSimple executives: Chen; TuSimple CEO Cheng Lu; and TuSimple COO Jianan Hao. The other three — James Lu, Zhen Tao, and Albert Schultz — are meant to be independent directors. If the second proposal were to pass, it would prevent shareholders from replacing the entire board in a single vote and it could entrench control with Chen, who would effectively be ensuring his preferred directors stay in place for the long term. A hearing to expedite the review of Hou’s complaint and to decide on his request to postpone TuSimple’s annual meeting is scheduled for December 2. TuSimple did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Title: Blackrock, State Street, Vanguard sued by Republican states over climate accords

By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) -BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) have been sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. Wednesday's complaint filed in the federal court in Tyler, Texas, is among the highest profile lawsuits targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals, or ESG. The defendants were accused of exploiting their market power and involvement in climate advocacy groups to pressure coal companies to slash output and reduce carbon emissions from coal by more than 50% by 2030, driving up consumers' utility bills. "Competitive markets -- not the dictates of far-flung asset managers -- should determine the price Americans pay for electricity," the states said in the complaint. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street together have more than $26 trillion of assets under management. In a statement, BlackRock said any suggestion it invested in coal producers to harm them was "baseless and defies common sense. This lawsuit undermines Texas' pro-business reputation and discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." Vanguard and State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The 11 states also include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. Republicans have long explored using U.S. antitrust laws to target alleged collusion among investment managers to advance climate-related goals. Climate advocates, in contrast, view assessing environmental risks as essential to determining what investments are worth. BIG STAKES IN COAL COMPANIES The states objected to BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street allegedly pressuring coal companies for change starting in 2021. They also criticized the defendants' membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which says members are committed to complying with all antitrust laws, and BlackRock's and State Street's membership in Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+. Vanguard left the Net Zero initiative in 2022, while BlackRock and State Street left Climate Action 100+ in February. But the states said the withdrawals did not negate the "ongoing and future threat" of continued pressure. It cited the defendants' investments in nine coal companies, including combined respective stakes of 34.2% and 30.4% in Arch Resources and Peabody Energy, the largest publicly traded U.S. coal producers. BlackRock was also accused in the lawsuit of "actively deceiving" investors about its non-ESG funds by promising to dedicate them to enhance shareholder value, when it allegedly used all its holdings to advance its climate goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office filed the lawsuit, in a statement accused the defendants of promoting an "illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized 'environmental' agenda." The lawsuit seeks to block the defendants from using their investments to vote on shareholder resolutions and take other steps that could undermine coal output and limit market competition. It also seeks civil fines for violating federal antitrust and Texas consumer protection laws. The case is Texas et al v BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 24-00437.
