Chalom, who helped launch BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, led the financial giant’s strategy on digital assets as the managing director and head of strategic ecosystem partnerships. “After 20 years at BlackRock and helping to lead its digital asset strategy, I’m beginning a new chapter: I’ve joined SharpLink Gaming as co-CEO,” he posted on X. He added that SharpLink is “built on a clear belief: that Ethereum is becoming the foundation of global finance. And I couldn’t agree more.” With Chalom’s addition, current SharpLink CEO Rob Phythian will begin transitioning into the role of president. After 20 years at BlackRock and helping to lead its digital asset strategy, I’m beginning a new chapter: I’ve joined @SharpLinkGaming as Co-CEO. Here’s why. At BlackRock, I helped launch: - IBIT — world’s largest Bitcoin ETP- ETHA — world’s largest Ethereum ETP- BUIDL —… — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) July 25, 2025 “Few executives in the world have had the kind of impact Joseph has had in unlocking institutional adoption of digital assets, having pioneered BlackRock’s strategic entry into the space,” SharpLink Chairman and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin said in a statement. “His decision to join SharpLink is a resounding validation of our ETH treasury strategy and vision for Ethereum to drive profound, transformative change across the global digital economy.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) With Chalom in tow, SharpLink will continue its mission of adding shareholder value long-term, utilizing Ethereum as a productive asset via staking, restaking, and other yield-bearing strategies to do so. The firm, which holds more than 360,000 ETH valued at more than $1.3 billion, acquired nearly 80,000 ETH in the last week as it builds its treasury. It recently detailed plans to raise up to $6 billion via a stock sale, with proceeds intended to fuel more ETH purchases. “We’re building a bridge between institutional capital and Ethereum-native yield, packaged in a single public equity,” posted Chalom. “The asset is ETH, the ticker is SBET.” Shares of SharpLink Gaming are down over 6% today to $21.89, extending its losses to more than 31% in the last 5 days of trading according to Google Finance.

Title: Goldman Sachs hungry for acquisitions — but not for the targets you think

Yes – Goldman Sachs is on the prowl for acquisitions, and it isn’t alone on Wall Street – but they may not be the deals you’ve been reading about. The speculation about Goldman buying Northern Trust (yes, I have been reporting it for years) is, at this point, likely nothing more than that, sources told On The Money. Northern Trust shares are up 20% on the chatter, but its CEO has been dismissive – and so are the people at Goldman, I am told. For one, Goldman CEO David Solomon doesn’t like overpaying, which is exactly what he’d have to do at this point to get Northern Trust to sell. I’ve also been told Goldman’s culture is too weirdly unique for it to combine with another same-sized bank. On that latter note: Solomon also isn’t looking to be the CEO who will cede control to a bigger player. Other deals, however, will happen at Goldman and elsewhere in banking. That’s right: Wall Street is rife with high-level bank merger discussions. They may or may not lead to a transaction, but the talks have officially begun, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The reason is a lighter regulatory approach by the Federal Reserve prodded by the more deal-friendly Trump administration that will allow large to mid-sized banks – stymied for years by post-financial crisis guardrails – to expand. True, you probably won’t see two large “systemically important” banks like Jamie Dimon’s JP Morgan buying up Goldman. But both JPMorgan and Goldman will be able to do significant, albeit smaller deals, my banking sources say. “Because of the Fed’s supervisory relaxation big bank deals are going to happen,” said one financial-service chief executive who asked not to be named. “Everyone is talking.” As I have reported, Solomon knows he needs to grow his smallish, but powerful investment house. Its market cap is $221 billion compared to more than $830 billion at JPMorgan. It could use heft and scale if it wants to remain relevant well into the future. One possible target for Goldman: State Street Corp., a mid-sized bank with around $30 billion in market value. It’s digestible and it is strong where many of the bigger players would like to be, like custodian services and various types of investment services (A State Street spokesman had no immediate comment). Another potential target for Goldman: the mid-sized BNY, formerly known as Bank of New York Mellon. Both companies have already announced a joint venture to offer “tokenized” money market funds, a precursor to a true merger later. People close to Goldman tell me a more immediate deal could be in the private credit or non-bank lenders space. BlackRock dived head first into private credit, snapping up HPS Investment Partners in 2024. CEO Larry Fink sees private credit booming and will soon offer retail investors products where they can get such exposure in their 401(k)s. A Goldman spokesman had no comment. A BNY rep declined comment. Meanwhile, Citigroup, after years of turmoil following its near demise during the 2008 financial crisis, is ripe to do a deal. Finally, its balance sheet has improved enough to give the Fed some assurance it has the capital to digest dealmaking.

Never miss a story. CEO Jane Fraser is impressing investors with her turnaround of the nation’s third largest bank (based on assets) and she now has the resources to combine with possibly a European bank that could enhance Citi’s strong point, which has always been its international footprint. (A Citi rep also declined to comment.) The giant Swiss bank UBS is also said to be on the prowl for US bank assets, On The Money has learned. This comes after its 2024 forced merger of the beleaguered Credit Suisse that Swiss banking regulators believed was needed to prevent a collapse of CS. “UBS is very aggressive to do a US deal to reduce its Swiss exposure,” my CEO source said. A UBS rep had no immediate comment. This is far from an exhaustive list and combos are all subject to change. But deal-making is in the air. Advertisement

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun HONG KONG, July 25 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison’s plan to sell most of its $22.8 billion ports business is unlikely to be finalized anytime soon, with political brinkmanship set to continue, and sources saying that a Sunday deadline for exclusive talks was likely to be extended. The Hong Kong conglomerate’s plan to sell the business, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping company MSC, has become politicized amid an escalating China-U.S. trade war. Negotiations for the deal, which covers 43 ports in 23 countries, are on an exclusive basis between CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, and the consortium for 145 days until Sunday, as per the terms announced in March. The deal talks, however, are unlikely to collapse if the two parties do not ink a pact by Sunday, with three people close to the ports-to-telecoms conglomerate saying the parties could extend the deadline to continue exclusive negotiations. The first part of the deal – definitive documentation to sell two port operations near the Panama Canal – was also not signed by an April 2 deadline set in the sales announcement. The people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. BlackRock declined to comment. CK Hutchison and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, which CK Hutchison said in May was the main investor in the consortium, did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the deal as “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, after his administration previously called for the removal of what it said was Chinese ownership of the ports near the canal. But in April, China’s top market regulator said that it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. Beijing’s stance on the planned deal was made public after pro-China media launched a stinging criticism, saying China had significant national interests in the transaction and it would be a betrayal of the country. “I think at this moment it’s not very optimistic that they can directly sell the ports to the consortium,” said Jackson Chan, global fixed income senior manager at FSMOne Hong Kong, which has clients holding CK Hutchison bonds. “The market has already digested the news, even if it announces next week that it won’t sell anymore, I don’t think it’ll be a shock because the market understands it wouldn’t have a large impact on its operations.” CK Hutchison shares, which jumped 33% the following two days after the deal was announced in early March, erased all of the gains by mid-April. But since then it regained lost ground along with the rise in the broader Hong Kong market index. The outlook for the deal has been clouded further in recent days, with a separate source telling Reuters that Chinese ports operator China Cosco Shipping Corp (COSCO) was also looking to join the consortium to buy the ports business. COSCO is requesting veto rights or equivalent power in the entity that will take over 43 ports from CK Hutchison, Bloomberg News reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter. COSCO did not respond to a request for comment. The existing consortium would likely allow COSCO into the deal, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “The bigger risk to the deal being consummated, in my opinion, is likely the Trump administration, which is likely to block a deal that would include China,” said the New Jersey-based analyst who tracks BlackRock. Ballingal Investment Advisors strategist David Blennerhassett, who publishes on the independent online research platform Smartkarma, said the addition of COSCO in the consortium was likely to enrage Trump. “Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, would be incandescent,” he said.

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) just hit a whopping $10B in assets in only 251 days, making it the third-fastest ETF to hit that milestone. Such a surge signals massive institutional interest in Ethereum, fueled by price gains, US regulatory clarity, and growing stablecoin adoption. It also drives fresh demand for all projects building on the Ethereum network, including high-utility ERC-20 tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT). The rise in BlackRock’s ETHA is happening in tandem with a dramatic rally in $ETH’s price. Just days ago, it hit $3.7K, a price not reached since January 2025. It’s now valued at just over $3.6K, up by nearly double compared to just last month. While the relationship between ETF inflows and $ETH’s price movement is complex, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas says that ‘They feed off each other, but it’s not one for one. It’s a chicken or egg question.’ And Ethereum ETFs are taking off. Between July 7 and July 24, 2025, US-listed Ethereum ETFs saw a total of $9.9B in net inflows, according to Farside Investors. The surge was driven by strong demand for low-fee offerings from BlackRock and Fidelity, which generated $8.9B and $2.3B, respectively. The broader environment is also boosting interest in $ETH, with the passing of the stablecoin bill (GENIUS Act) significantly boosting Web3’s overall outlook. Ethereum stands to benefit the most. This is because it dominates all other networks when it comes to stablecoin activity, and with a whopping $80.958B total value locked (TVL), it holds 59.65% of the total market share. It’s supported by a massive $131.42B stablecoin market cap and $USDT (an Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the US dollar), which makes up 50.96% of the market. In comparison, Solana – the second-largest – has $9.739B in TVL, highlighting that no other network come close to Ethereum’s usage, engagement, and financial throughput. As institutional capital flows into $ETH and Ethereum continues to lead in TVL, stablecoin dominance, and on-chain activity, the demand for tools that simplify and speed up on-chain trading is bound to explode. This is precisely the moment that $SNORT’s Telegram trading assistant – Snorter Bot – was built for. Imagine being able to trade, snipe, and manage $ETH among other tokens directly on the world’s fourth-largest messaging app with no browser or extensions needed. Well, that’s precisely what Snorter Bot promises to deliver in Q3 2025. Once live, you’ll be able to buy and sell tokens instantly, set stop-losses, track portfolio performance, and mirror trades in one user-friendly interface. Built for speed and cost-efficiency, it aims to outperform competitors with the fastest execution on Solana and ultra-low fees of just 0.85% for token holders. This percentage is significantly lower than bots like Maestro, BonkBot, and Trojan, which typically charge 1% or more. Initially, it’ll launch on Solana, with integration on Ethereum and BNB Chain already in the final stages of development. Then, it’ll expand to other EVM-compatible chains – including Polygon and Base – as part of its ongoing, ambitious roadmap. And it will all be achieved while maintaining top-tier security. Snorter Bot is being built with a private RPC infrastructure, MEV protection, and scam-detection tools, including honeypot and rug pull filters. Such security protocols have never been more critical. Rug pulls alone made up 68% of all crypto-related scams in Q1 2025. $SNORT is the gateway to maximizing the ecosystem’s benefits. It removes sniping limits, offers access to advanced analytics and tools, and will grant voting rights in its upcoming DAO. It’s staking friendly, too. After buying the coin, you can stake it at a sizable 173% APY. The sooner you do so, the more you’ll earn, as this rate will drop as more users enter the pool. It’s no wonder that $SNORT has already surpassed $2.3M on presale, backed by major whale investors who have contributed $40K, $10.8K, and $10K. BlackRock’s $10B Ethereum ETF shows just how strong institutional interest in Ethereum has become. As $ETH continues to skyrocket and Ethereum network activity surges, the desire for fast and secure trading tools is rising just as quickly. This is precisely where Snorter Bot comes into its own. Not only will it track $ETH’s future trajectory in real-time, but also other major coins. By doing so, it’ll give you a leg up in the trading arena while the market continues to boom.

Title: Washington and Beijing’s Mexican Standoff

As Trump’s bumbling threats continue to alienate the US in Latin America, China is increasingly determined to hold its ground in the US’ so-called “backyard”. Just over a week ago, the embassies of the world’s two apex economic superpowers, the US and China, clashed in Mexico. The spark was a speech given by US Ambassador (and former CIA agent and Green Beret) Ronald Johnson at a gathering of a gala dinner of the American Society of Mexico (AMSOC) sponsored by the billionaire tycoon Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who is seeking to position himself as a populist Milei-type figure in Mexican politics. In what can only be described as a severe case of projection, Johnson accused “countries like China of trying to impose their financial control and greater economic and supply chain dependence on some places in our own Western Hemisphere”. The words represented the latest escalation in the battle for economic power and influence in Latin America between the US and China. It is a battle that the US is handily losing, as we have reported for the past four years and as even the FT conceded last year. China is already South America’s largest trade partner. As Reuters reported in 2022, if you take Mexico’s huge trade partnership with the US out of the equation, which Trump seems determined to torpedo, China has already overtaken the US as Latin America’s largest trade partner. Even a fanatically US-aligned government like Milei’s is strengthening its ties with China, much to Washington’s chagrin, while the Petro government of traditional US vassal state Colombia has joined the BRICS bank and is talking about cancelling its NATO global partnership due to the military alliance’s support of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Colombia’s🇨🇴 President Gustavo Petro says Colombia will LEAVE partnership with NATO over the Gaza genocide: ‘How can we stand with armies that drop bombs on children? Those armies are not armies of freedom, those are armies of darkness. We have to leave, there’s no other way.’ pic.twitter.com/yZyTX1G0un — Going Underground (@GUnderground_TV) July 17, 2025 As is becoming increasingly clear, China is determined to hold its ground in the US’ so-called “backyard”. As the American Quarterly notes, the recent China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) summit underscored the striking contrast between the two countries’ approaches: Xi Jinping appears to be aligning more closely than ever with the region as the Trump administration pushes an agenda focused on migration, tariffs, and even expansionist ambitions… By announcing a $9 billion yuan-denominated credit line and fresh infrastructure investment for the region, Xi not only reasserted China’s role as a development financier but also positioned the yuan as an alternative to the dollar-dominated monetary logic—a strategy aligned with the country’s long-term efforts to internationalize its currency. “There are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars. Bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation,” Xi said in his inaugural speech. In September last year, Beijing urged the US to give up the antiquated Monroe Doctrine as Washington intensified its meddling in Mexico, Venezuela and Honduras. The Chinese government also continues to block a corporate deal that would transfer ownership of more than 40 sea ports, including two crucial terminals on the Panama canal, to a Western BlackRock-led consortium, again much to the chagrin of Washington. Now, Mexico finds itself on the frontlines of this escalating tussle between the world’s two apex economic superpowers. In response to Ambassador Johnson’s remarks, the Chinese embassy in Mexico posted a tweet accusing the US of spreading “lies full of ideological prejudices and cold war thinking”: The “theory of China’s threat”, hysterically propagated by the United States, is nothing more than an excuse to maintain its own hegemony. From imposing arbitrary restrictions and erecting commercial barriers, to mistreating foreign immigrants and trafficking in illegal weapons, as well as inventing false positions to sanction financial institutions from other countries, a country like the United States is shamelessly killing the region of the Western Hemisphere. The United States seeks everywhere and in every way to set traps and attach labels to China, forgetting that it is [the US itself] that constitutes the true regional destabilizer, economic-commercial threat and saboteur of development. Justice lives in the hearts of the people, the United States’ defamation of China is destined to fail. It would be advisable for the Ambassador of the United States in Mexico to dedicate more energy to promoting friendship with the country in which he believes, instead of inventing things out of nothing and confusing white with black, to avoid a total loss of credibility. US Losing Credibility So far, the tweet has had almost half a million views. One point it raises that is undeniable is that the US is rapidly losing credibility in Mexico. With his unilateral aggressions against the country, Trump has already caused a dramatic a shift in public opinion… towards China. One recent Pew Research survey found that 45% of Mexicans consider China to be the largest economy in the world, up from 33% two years ago. Crucially, 45% of respondents said they want the relationship with China to be prioritised over that of the United States while 44% would prefer relations with the US to be prioritised. This places Mexico among the most polarised countries on the issue of US/China relations. Interestingly, Mexico was one of only five of the 24 (Western or Western-aligned) countries surveyed by Pew Research that wanted its government to prioritise relations with China, albeit by a wafer-thin margin. Perhaps most importantly, more than two-thirds of Mexican respondents (68%) considered the United States to be the greatest threat to the country, compared to 5% for China. That is well above the levels of distrust for the US registered among Indonesians (40 percent vs. 19 percent), South Africans (35 percent vs. 13 percent), Turks (30 percent vs. 2 percent), Brazilians (29 percent vs. 15 percent) and Argentines (24 percent vs. 13 percent). This last result is perhaps unsurprising given that members of the Trump administration have been debating to what extent, not whether, the US should “invade” Mexico, and have been issuing threats on a more or less constant basis. That this is intensifying anti-US sentiment in a country that has already suffered at least 10 military interventions from its northern neighbour in its 204 years of independence from Spain is hardly surprising. There is a clear shift in public opinion taking place in Mexico, and it is one that is likely to intensify as long as Trump continues to treat the country as his piñata. Here is a quick recap of some of the provocative threats and actions the Trump administration has launched against Mexico, the US’ largest trade partner, over the past eight months: As El País notes, one of the main reasons why Trump is constantly attacking the US’ North American trade partners, Mexico and Canada, is to gain leverage in the coming renegotiation of the USMCA. Sheinbaum’s position since Trump’s trade war began has been to preserve the USMCA; however, the neighbouring country to the North and main buyer of Mexican exports, advocates a “renegotiation” of the trade agreement. “President Trump is definitely going to renegotiate the USMCA, but that will be within a year. He wants to protect American jobs, he doesn’t want cars to be made in Canada or Mexico when they could be manufactured in Michigan and Ohio,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this weekend in local media. The problem for Mexico is that a renegotiated USMCA deal is likely to be even more prejudicial than the current one, especially if Trump carries through on his threat to close down automotive plants in Mexico and Canada. Then there’s the simple fact that the US’ word means nada. Trump may end up signing a new deal only to violate it or renege on it days later. The constant threats of intervention will also no doubt continue, and may even be acted upon. China: A Realistic Alternative? In other words, the world’s largest trade partnership will almost certainly continue to sour as Mexico’s deeply asymmetrical relationship with its biggest trade partner becomes more and more abusive. An early example of blowback from Trump’s tariffs and remittance tax was a 10% fall in Coca Cola’s sales volumes in Mexico, one of its most important markets in the second quarter. As readers may recall, Coca Cola was the target of a consumer boycott in the early days of Trump 2.0. But does China represent an economic alternative? The current answer is: definitely not. Although trade between the two countries has ballooned in recent years, it is almost all going in one direction: from China to Mexico, and in many cases onwards to the US. In 2024, Mexico’s exports to China represented just 1.5% of its total exports while its imports from China represented just over 20% of the total. Contrast that with Mexico-US trade: Mexico’s exports to the US last year represented 83% of all its exports while its imports represented just over 40% of the total. Which begs the question: given the vast gulf between their respective trade volumes, why is the US even worried about Mexico-China relations? The answer is simple: it is the trend that matters. As Enrique Dussel, the director of the UNAM’s Center for China-Mexico Studies (Cechimex), explains to El País, Mexico’s trade with China increased from 1% of the total in 2000 to 11% China in 2022, while its trade with the US fell from 81% of the total to 62% in the same period, mainly due to the rise in Mexican imports of Chinese goods: This U.S. is Mexico’s first trade partner with a downward trend, China is the second with an upward trend. What is happening in Mexico is also happening in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile: the productive apparatus is replacing imports that were historically American with Chinese ones. The products affected include electronics, auto parts, telecommunications and automotive. It is not a one-to-one correspondence, but there is a strong association of substitution through imports. Within this reality, the trilateral relationship between China, Mexico and the US is unique, as we noted in a post last September, just two months before Trump’s re-election: The US and Mexico share the world’s most frequently crossed border and after 30 years of NAFTA and USMCA, their economies are tightly coupled. China and Mexico are not just trade partners but direct competitors vying for the custom of the world’s largest consumer market, which is trying to wean itself off Chinese products. Mexico has so far emerged as the largest beneficiary of the US’ nearshoring strategy, but the more it exports to the US, the more it needs to import from China. And that is the last thing the US wants. Over the past year, the US has escalated its war of words against both China and Mexico over the illicit fentanyl trade that is killing tens of thousands of US citizens a year. But as AMLO [and now Sheinbaum have] repeatedly argued, the US government has spectacularly failed to address the root causes of drug addiction within its borders. Instead, some US lawmakers and pundits have proposed using military force on Mexico’s sovereign territory, with or without Mexico’s permission, to combat drug cartels. That was the situation before Trump’s arrival. The situation today is far worse. On the one hand, Trump 2.0 is intent on undoing many of the nearshoring processes Trump 1.0 unleashed by targeting China with tariffs. On the other hand, Mexico is arguably as dependent as ever on the US even though its trade with the US as a proportion of the total has fallen somewhat. Mexico sources around half its food from the US and more than 70% of its natural gas. Mexico’s sheer level of dependence on the US — no comparably sized economy in the world sends more than 80% of its exports to one destination — and the constant threats of military or financial intervention emanating Washington, Mexico suffers from a structural vulnerability that limits the sovereign capacity of the Mexican State to make long-term strategic decisions. The Mexican economist Mario Campa notes that one of the two main stumbling blocks preventing closer ties between Mexico and China is the huge — and growing — trade deficit between the two countries, which he claims could be somewhat rectified through trade negotiations. The other, of course, is Washington. Regardless of who occupies the White House, the US government and its myriad agencies will not look kindly upon Mexico further deepening its trade relations with China, or the BRICS as a whole. But what alternative will Mexico have? To stay trapped in an increasingly dysfunctional relationship with a country whose government keeps threatening to invade? While many of the relative benefits of USMCA are whittled away next year by Trump’s protectionist demands? The Sheinbaum government’s response so far has been to launch Plan Mexico, an ambitious national industrial policy whose main objective is to reposition Mexico as a global hub for advanced manufacturing, technological innovation, attracting foreign direct investment and relocating production chains, with an emphasis on key sectors such as automotive, electronics, aerospace, pharmaceuticals and information technologies. The question is: whose market(s) will it serve if the USMCA unravels? For geographic reasons and given the unparalleled size of its consumer market, the US makes the most sense. Even without a North American trade deal and with Trump’s tariffs, the US will struggle to find a cheaper, more reliable manufacturing hub literally on its doorstep. Meanwhile, China is at the core of the Asia-Pacific region, which has been the main engine of global economic growth so far in the twenty-first century. If it can, Mexico should expand its exposure to that region. One way of doing that will be by completing the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT), which could help establish Mexico as a global logistics hub. This huge infrastructure project is scheduled to be fully operational in the first half of next year. Once completed, it will link up four key ports — Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Dos Bocas, Tabasco, and Puerto Chiapas — via 1,200 kms of railway lines, integrating 10 industrial and development poles. CIIT is arguably Mexico’s most ambitious infrastructure project of this still rather young century and its timing could not be better, coming as the Panama Canal’s logistics remain at the mercy of the weather and climate. There is also the ongoing tussle between the US and China over who owns the company operating the two ports at each end of the canal, which recently escalated into a war of words between the US and Chinese embassies in Panama. As I noted in my article last week on Trump’s tomato tariffs, if there’s one thing that can push Mexico closer to the BRICS, and by extension China, it is Trump himself. Without his constant bullying, Mexico may not have agreed to participate in the recent BRICS summit, for the first time ever. Mexico and founding BRICS member Brazil, Latin America’s two largest economies, are now fast-tracking negotiations for an expanded trade agreement as both countries brace for hefty US tariffs, set to take effect on August 1. This would probably not have happened, at least not this quickly, if it weren’t for Trump’s accidental matchmaking. Also this week, a Department of Homeland Security official warned that Mexican drug cartels could soon deploy weaponised drones at the border. I maybe wrong but i think these people will be CIA assets to escalate the situation Mexico is not in a good place but I do not see them having much choice than to start re-orientating their market away from the US and more to China and the BRICS to balance out trade more. And the reason is simple. Trump. As he is going to be President for the next three and a half years Mexico has to think about what that will mean for Mexican – US relations between now and 2028. And the truth of the matter is that Trump will keep on coming back to Mexico again and again so long as he thinks that there is money and concessions on the table to be had. And on any single day Trump could wake up and decide to put 50% tariffs on Mexico unless they changed a law or maybe their constitution or freed some prisoner or maybe even halt construction of the CIIT as it being unfair to American commerce or something. If it has the ability to compete with the Panama Canal then absolutely he will target it. And maybe there will be some US strike in Mexico on a suspected Cartel house or something. It would be crazy reckless but as the Neocons are running his government right now, it may only be a matter of time. Tough times for Mexico ahead. Turn’s out that Trump and Co are fools after all. If there was any hope left that Trump was “crazy like a fox”, it’s long since gone. If Trump and Co had any brains, they should have realised that in a post-globalised world, the highly integrated economies of the three big North American economies Canada, USA, and Mexico are the future for any hope of a MAGA future. But as befits halfwits and semi educated morons, they miss the bigger picture and at the same time they alienate their closest neighbours and most strategic allies. Trump is a real estate developer way out of his depth whose ideas of “negotiation” owe more to thuggery than any geo strategic and economic insight. Do you know why soccer isn’t as popular as baseball in the United States? It’s because they always score own goals! It’s because you can’t put many commercial breaks in a continuous gameplay. “Mexico is not in a good place…” I’m not so so sure, the economy is booming, the MxPeso is soaring, and. at least in this town and state (Querétaro) there is an amazing level of confidence and optimism and calm. It is somewhat inexplicable to me, but there you have it: Mexicans are tough and this is not their first rodeo. Big difference between here and Canada, which is angry and defiant, but cowering. Maybe it is explained by Mexico’s level of industrialization: they actually make things here. Thanks, Don, you raise a key point. Mexico actually makes things, and Queretero is right at the beating heart of its ongoing transformation. Maybe, just maybe, Plan Mexico could work, especially if the country is able to continue diversifying its economy away from the US. Forging closer trade ties with Brazil should help in that regard.

Ethereum's market cap representation in ETFs jumps to 5%, signaling its status as a prime investment. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are recording a remarkable surge in investor interest, consistently outperforming their Bitcoin counterparts throughout the past week. SoSo Value data shows that spot ETH ETFs attracted $231.23 million in new capital on July 24, edging past the $226.61 million net inflows recorded by spot Bitcoin ETFs. When the timeline is extended to the past six trading days, spot ETH ETFs have received nearly $2.4 billion in net inflows, almost triple the $827.6 million logged by Bitcoin ETFs in the same period. This trend reflects a broader shift in institutional investor sentiment, with attention moving increasingly toward Ethereum-based products. Speaking on the milestone, crypto analyst Bec said: “This is the first time in ETF history that Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin in daily inflows across multiple trading sessions. It’s clear ETH is officially regarded as a institutional grade asset.” The inflow momentum has propelled Ethereum ETF holdings to new record heights. In July 2025 alone, ETH ETFs have absorbed more than $4.4 billion in inflows, exceeding the total inflows from the entire previous 12-month period, which stood at $4.2 billion. As a result, the total amount of ETH held by ETFs has jumped by nearly 50% in just two months, rising from 3.5 million ETH on May 1 to 5.6 million ETH as of July 24, according to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve. Their holdings now represent roughly 5% of ETH’s market capitalization. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has played a critical role in this run. Since July 1, ETHA has added over 1 million ETH to its portfolio, growing its holdings to 2.8 million ETH, valued at approximately $10.22 billion. This rapid accumulation helped ETHA become the third-fastest ETF in history to hit $10 billion in assets under management. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the speed of ETHA’s growth, noting it went from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days, which is “the ETF equivalent of a God candle.” Despite the funds’ strong performance, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes Ethereum is still underrepresented in ETF portfolios. According to Hougan, investors would need to allocate an additional $7–8 billion to bring ETH exposure in line with market weight, assuming Bitcoin ETF flows remain flat.

Title: BlackRock’s ETH ETF hits $10B milestone in record time! – Details

There was a spike in profit-taking, but ETH’s speculative froth was not dangerously elevated yet. BlackRock ETH ETF, ETHA, hit $10 billion, making it the third-fastest growing product to hit the milestone after two spot BTC ETFs. Will ETH push higher or cool off? U.S. spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a tear recently. In particular, BlackRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, saw massive inflows and hit $10 billion milestone in assets under management (AUM). This feat has even rivaled some traditional products, noted Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, adding that, “$ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after two Bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC.” Source: X BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETFs were the 1st and 2nd to hit the milestone, followed by ETHA. But ETHA’s inflows streak was unique in one aspect; it doubled from $5 billion AUM to $10 billion in the past two weeks of trading, a move Balchunas called a ‘God candle.’ The spot ETH ETF products have seen positive inflows for 11 weeks straight. On the 24th of July, they saw a daily net inflow of $231 million, setting the 15th consecutive day of net inflows. Source: Soso Value Notably, the renewed surge in daily net inflows from early July rallied ETH from $2.4K to $3.8K, posting a 45% monthly gain. But the rally, also backed by massive demand from ETH treasury firms, has attracted significant selling. In fact, mid-July saw ETH profit-taking hit $1.4 billion per day on average, mirroring the levels seen during past local peaks in 2024. Source: Glassnode At press time, ETH traded at $3.6K, down 6% from the recent high of $3.8K amid a sharp BTC drop to $115K. This could be a healthy retreat before taking a stab at $4K since the Open Interest was at record highs of $57 billion, underscoring high speculative interest and liquidation risk. Source: CryptoQuant Even so, the speculative market was still ‘neutral’ as there was no extreme retail FOMO on the Futures market, per CryptoQuant data. This further suggested that ETH could still have room for growth before topping out or hitting a local top. Even so, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen warned that ETH may need to cool off, citing the overbought condition of ETH’s daily RSI. “ETH Daily RSI rejected at around 88. I would not suggest using RSI to identify when larger trends are over, but it can be good for sometimes guessing when the market needs to cool off.” Source: X Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

CK Hutchison's $22.8 billion ports business sale to a BlackRock-led consortium faces delays amid political tensions and regulatory scrutiny. The deal, encompassing 43 ports including those near the Panama Canal, is complicated by China-U.S. trade war dynamics and potential antitrust concerns. While the exclusive negotiation deadline may extend, the addition of COSCO to the consortium could further inflame U.S. opposition.

ETHA needed just 251 days to reach this threshold, less time than all but the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fundspot Bitcoin funds, which needed just 34 days and 53 days, respectively. The fund doubled in size over 10 days ending Wednesday, adding $5 billion in assets to become the shortest period ever for a fund to grow from that mark to $10 billion, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "That five to $10 billion move, most of that's the price, although the flows were really robust too," Balchunas said. "So it was a nice combination of both. But I don't think I've ever seen an ETF grow that quickly. "This is very weird stuff," he added. The inflow surge has been closely intertwined with a dramatic spike in the asset, which on Monday approached $3,850, its highest point since December. It is currently trading about 3.5% below that at $3,710, according to CoinGecko data. Analysts have attributed the increase, along with the rise of ETH treasuries, to growing interest in the funds, although Balchunas said the cause and effect was unclear. "Flows in the price are like tangoing," he said. "I don't think the flows make the price go up. I don't think the price makes the flows go up 100%. They feed off each other, but it's not one for one. It's a chicken or egg question." LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC. Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W. Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 After starting tepidly a year ago by the lofty standards of the spot Bitcoin funds that preceded it, Ethereum exchange-traded funds started to accelerate amid a friendlier environment for digital assets under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, including the recent passage of the GENIUS Act. The legislation is expected to benefit Ethereum, the dominant platform for stablecoin transactions. The nine U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs generated more than $1.1 billion in inflows just over the first three days of this week alone, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Still, the funds' performance falls well short of the dramatic success of the 12 Bitcoin products that now hold more than $140 billion in AUM, led by IBIT, which now manages more than $70 billion in assets. Those funds have also benefited from the surge in crypto markets and contributed to it. In a text to Decrypt. ETF.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy wrote that he was surprised at how long it took for ETF investors "to come around," particularly after Bitcoin funds' fast start. "That all changed over the past few weeks as the mania over stablecoins and Ethereum Treasury companies gave the asset a shot in the arm," he wrote. "We'll see if this is the catalyst that finally breaks Ethereum prices out of their trading range—it may or may not be," he added. "Regardless, it signals that the demand for Ethereum ETFs has finally arrived."

Title: Tether Investments Extend Beyond Bitcoin Amid Record Profits — Details
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/tether-usdt/tether-investments-extend/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T19:00:25Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has disclosed a portion of its investment portfolio, revealing an involvement in cryptocurrencies that extend beyond Bitcoin (BTC). The announcement comes as Tether reports record profits in 2024, which have been used to fund these strategic investments in more than 120 companies across multiple sectors. Tether has unveiled a glimpse into its expansive investment portfolio, marking a significant pivot in its capital allocation strategy beyond just Bitcoin. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, confirmed in an X social media post that the stablecoin firm has invested in over 120 companies as part of its Tether Investment division. He added that this number is expected to grow in the coming months and years. Notably, Ardoino disclosed that these investments are funded exclusively through the company’s record profits from 2024, which total $13.7 billion. He emphasized that none of the funds were obtained from reserves backing Tether’s stablecoin. Interestingly, Tether’s profits, generated from yield on its holdings of over $130 billion in US Treasuries, are now being directed into transformative industries through some of the most prominent companies. Its venture arm has expanded its focus past Bitcoin, now investing in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, privacy infrastructure, tokenization, agriculture, and others. When asked by Crypto Tale how this diverse portfolio supports USDT’s position amid an increasingly stringent global regulatory environment, Ardoino underscored its strategic importance. On the question of USDT’s future in Europe under the continent’s new MiCA regulations, the Tether CEO stated that the stablecoin company would only consider re-entry once the regulatory landscape offers stronger protections for both consumers and stablecoin issuers. On its official website, Tether shared a partial list of some of the companies among the 120 it has invested in. These range from blockchain infrastructure platforms like Synonym and Holepunch, to AI-focused firms like Crystal Intelligence, and payment technology providers such as CityPay.io and Sorted Wallet. The presence of companies like Blackrock Neurotech and Adecoagro reflects a commitment to broader technological and environmental impact, reaching into neuroscience and agriculture, respectively. Tether’s investment narrative is framed not solely in financial terms but as a deliberate push toward catalyzing decentralization and empowering individuals. The stablecoin firm declared its capital as a “catalyst for change,” invested in projects that reduce reliance on centralized systems and promote global equity. This mission-driven approach is visible across its portfolio, which also includes companies involved in data sovereignty like Northern Data, cross-border financial solutions such as Quantoz and OrionX, and privacy-first communication platforms. Mansa, a DeFi fintech venture, and Oobit, a global crypto payment platform, have also joined Tether’s investment portfolio, marking another step toward the company’s push toward real-world crypto adoption. Both firms expressed appreciation for the support, aligning with Tether’s broader vision to integrate stablecoins into everyday payment systems.

Title: Did Bitcoin Turn Pretty? Why Summer 2025 Is For The Girls

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 16: (L-R) Gavin Casalegno, Lola Tung and Christopher Briney attend "The ... More Summer I Turned Pretty" Season Three Launch Party on July 16, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Valerie Terranova/Getty Images for Prime Video) Summer 2025 may go down in history as the season when Bitcoin stopped being the outsider and became the main character. What began as an experimental digital currency traded on obscure forums has, fifteen years later, matured into a global asset at the center of Washington policy, Wall Street portfolios, and mortgage approvals. This summer didn’t just mark Bitcoin’s hottest days. It marked its arrival. Between a record-breaking price surge, landmark legislation, and unprecedented mainstream financial integration, Bitcoin has moved past the era of ideological fringe to claim a front-row seat in global finance. Here are three reasons why Summer 2025 is a Bitcoin summer. On July 14, 2025, Bitcoin reached $123,091.61, its highest price ever recorded, capping off a nearly 30% surge since January. The milestone followed a wave of renewed institutional investment, with ETF inflows at record levels and retail interest returning amid growing policy clarity. The rally felt different this time. Less like the speculative manias of 2017 or 2021, and more like a reflection of Bitcoin’s position in the financial mainstream. ETF flows from providers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton have helped push Bitcoin into retirement accounts and brokerage portfolios. In previous cycles, price booms were often dismissed as driven by hype, memes, and momentum. But today, Bitcoin is being discussed not just in Telegram chats but in earnings calls, investment committees, and Capitol Hill hearings. For years, Bitcoin has carried a reputation, fair or not, as a cause embraced primarily by libertarians, tech bros, and more recently, the MAGA-aligned wing of the Republican party. However, that perception began to shift significantly this summer with the passage of the GENIUS Act, the first federal law to establish a clear framework for stablecoin regulation. Signed into law on July 18, 2025, the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and signals a broader institutional embrace of digital assets, including Bitcoin. While the GENIUS Act focuses on dollar-backed stablecoins, its impact reaches far beyond. By providing regulatory clarity and standards for digital asset issuers, custodians, and reserve management, the law creates an environment where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can grow within the bounds of established financial norms. It also helps distance the space from its earlier associations with regulatory gray areas and political extremism. This shift is particularly significant for groups that have been historically underrepresented in the crypto world. Statistically, women are less likely to invest in digital assets and more likely to vote for candidates outside the Republican party. A regulatory framework that emphasizes transparency, compliance, and consumer protection makes the industry more accessible to broader demographics, including women who may have been wary of crypto’s Wild West past. The passage of the GENIUS Act marks a turning point. No longer defined by slogans or partisan divides, digital assets are moving into a phase of maturity. For Bitcoin, the law brings more than legal recognition. It brings the promise of new participants, new voices, and a more diverse future. From memes to mortgages, Bitcoin has entered the mainstream in ways that once seemed improbable. This summer, the Federal Housing Finance Agency officially issued guidance allowing cryptocurrency to count as a reserve asset when underwriting mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That means Bitcoin, under the right conditions, can now help homebuyers qualify for a loan backed by the U.S. government. The move is part of a broader normalization of Bitcoin in traditional finance. ETFs have opened new on-ramps for both retail and institutional investors, and more banks are exploring Bitcoin custody, payments integration, and even stablecoin issuance. Bitcoin is being discussed not just as a speculative asset, but also as a component of diversified portfolios, financial planning strategies, and corporate treasuries. Culturally, too, Bitcoin’s image is shifting. What was once the domain of libertarians and crypto-anarchists has expanded to include professional athletes, pension funds, and suburban homeowners. Even traditionally cautious sectors like healthcare and higher education have begun experimenting with Bitcoin adoption, either on their balance sheets or through philanthropic arms. The idea of Bitcoin as “fringe” no longer holds. It has outgrown its early identity crisis and settled into something both more complex and more accepted. It’s not about overthrowing the system anymore, it’s becoming part of it. This summer didn’t just bring beach days and blockbuster headlines, it brought a narrative shift. Bitcoin has had its moments before, but never quite like this. The convergence of policy clarity, market highs, and real-world utility suggests not just a seasonal high but a turning point in long-term adoption. There are still challenges ahead. Regulatory uncertainty remains for some aspects of crypto. Energy debates, custody risks, and international competition continue to swirl. But the foundation laid in Summer 2025 points to a future where Bitcoin isn’t just surviving, it’s thriving. In the end, it may not be the flashiest headlines that mark Bitcoin’s breakthrough, but the quieter signs of permanence. Mortgages. Laws. Retirement accounts. Public trust. These are the slow, steady victories that define maturity.

Title: When Politics and Finance Merge, Truth Surpasses Fiction

Full Content:
In 1601, Robert Devereux, the 2nd Earl of Essex, asked Shakespeare’s company, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, to stage the play Richard II at the Globe Theatre. This was done in the wake of an attempted coup against Queen Elizabeth. The intent was to stir anti-monarchical sentiment by depicting the overthrow of a weak king. The rebellion, however, did not succeed, and Devereux was executed. House of Cards, the series starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, is a brilliant depiction of power-hungry politicians at the helm of the White House and their maneuvers to stay in power. Borgen, the Danish series, is a masterpiece of political intrigue and the backstage machinations of decision-making. Political fiction is a powerful tool to evoke ideas—which is probably why it is often one of the first things to disappear when politicians begin to wield power beyond party politics. It’s difficult to imagine these series being produced today in China, Russia, or Turkey, for example. They show a side of politics that is too real—of course dramatized, but still a representation of the inner workings of politics that most people only glimpse through news coverage. Russia has Roman Bolyaev, who produced The Last Minister but left the country when the war in Ukraine started. Türkiye produced the series Valley of the Wolves, which, although it makes references to Turkish politics and corruption, does so by blaming a powerful mafia that infiltrated the state—rather than the state itself. Of course, that is not to say there are no Chinese, Russian, or Turkish political dramas—there might be—but to my knowledge, none depict the current political climate as a ruthless set of ambitious individuals willing to do almost anything to stay in power. Such portrayals would not reflect well on the current governments. Let’s propose a few loglines for future productions: An ex-KGB agent rises to power, promising to fight the mafia that has taken over the state, but ends up creating his own to maintain control. A Communist Party leader takes over a developing economy and pushes it to become the world’s largest, while he becomes its de facto king. An idealistic young politician rises to power and changes a country, but in the process, compromises the ideals he started with. I think these loglines would make for pretty good series that will never be made—at least not in the countries where they are set. The reason I believe they will not be made is not just because censorship exists in these countries and not in liberal democracies. Censorship exists everywhere, one way or another. The reason is that in these countries, politics—not party politics—matters far more than in Western liberal democracies. Governments hold more power than their liberal counterparts, and I believe this is because there is no true division of powers in these countries. I am not speaking about the theoretical division of power into three branches—the judiciary, the legislative, and the executive—which constitutions establish. This division, though ideal on paper, is difficult to maintain in reality, and most authoritarian regimes claim to uphold it. I am speaking about the division between political power and financial power. If we leave ideology aside (with perhaps a few exceptions), this is the main difference between governments today. When financial and political power are unified, the state’s reach becomes far more extensive. Trump knows this—or at least his team does—which is why he has been campaigning against Jerome Powell to try to remove him. The issue isn’t just that the Fed’s policies don’t align with his own—it’s about who controls financial power and economic policy. Varoufakis describes it like this: In the United States, there’s a war happening—not just a class war but also an intra-capitalist war between the cloud capital owners of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Wall Street will never allow people like Zuckerberg, Musk, or Apple to steal their financial rents—they’d “nuke” them if necessary. That’s why there’s no app like WeChat in the West. It’s not because the West can’t develop a free payment system like WeChat, but because Wall Street wouldn’t allow it, and Wall Street controls the central bank. This isn’t the case in China. What Varoufakis is pointing out is that in the US, Europe, England, Canada, and the West in general, banking and financial power are separate from political power. In China, this is different. The central bank is government-controlled, not independent. The country’s largest banks are state-owned. The state directly invests in private projects. There are private banks and financiers, but they don’t control the system. In the US, the Federal Reserve resists political pressure, but its leadership seems to have been cognitively captured by the banking industry. In Europe and the UK, central banks operate independently of the government. The ECB, which rules over them, is, to all intents and purposes, an independent entity free from political control. The largest banks and investment funds (e.g., JPMorgan, BlackRock) are private. Financial power and financial policymaking are not in politicians’ hands. As Varoufakis continues: Smart people in Washington DC realize China has a fantastic advantage because of this merger of cloud capital and finance—what I call “cloud finance,” which can’t happen in the US due to the war between financial and cloud capital. China’s political economy allows seamless integration. “China’s political economy allows seamless integration” because politics and finance are already merged, unlike in the West. The mantra there is “laissez-faire,” which is very good—except when the one saying it holds the unique privilege of creating money out of nothing. And everyone wants that privilege. Then it can turn a bit sour. The conflict Varoufakis mentions isn’t new either. It could be argued that it was among the key motives behind most revolutions, including France’s Revolution in 1789: when a new wealthy class becomes conscious of its power, it seeks to reshape the established order. That’s why Silicon Valley aligns with the Trump administration and why Trump is trying to influence Fed policy. Silicon Valley wants its seat at the table, and Trump’s administration wants control—at least a degree of it—over finance. China’s real advantage over the US—and what others (like Russia, with more success than Turkey) try to imitate—is the merger of political and financial power. This gives the state unprecedented influence over its citizens, and when combined with technological advancements, it creates a Leviathan unlike anything we have seen before. That’s why series like House of Cards or Borgen—which offer an uncanny look at politics—won’t be made in countries where financial and political power have merged. In those places, politics matters too much, and the reality of it surpasses fiction. Politicians are addicts and nothing is more corrosive to the soul or more addictive than power. Sorry, I have to disagree, and as an explanation, offer this paraphrase; The real disadvantage the US has, when compared to China, is the fact that our government has been coopted, and rendered relatively powerless when faced with any choice that might conflict with the interests of our financial elites. The neutering of our government’s ability to regulate finance has been under constant attack since at least the publishing of the Powell memo in 1971; The memo was a call to arms for corporate America to use its economic power to push back against the left, with particular emphasis on the importance of gaining sway over the courts, the academy, and the media. In reality, over the last 5 decades, corporate America, and finance has been allowed much too much influence in ‘the West’, and that is our disadvantage. And China’s government has so far managed to avoid many of the problems we face as a nation because in China, corporations, and finance, of whatever flavor, have not been allowed to purchase control of the government. Very interesting thesis, Curro. So are we changing from a system in the USA where finance and cloud compete to control the state to one where cloud and finance merge into the state? I’m not sure the state has that much power in the USA after working for finance all these years. It seems to me that American politicians have played the role of salesman for finance for so long that they’re incapable of thinking or speaking for themselves. It’s undeniable, though, that the Chinese and Russian systems are working much better than what’s been installed in the EU and USA. Here’s the missing link; Powell memo info I think this article makes a pretty good case for an independent central bank. If power is centralized, and concentrated, it becomes easier to corrupt. The US, like Germany, has a strong and well distributed regional banks, which serve as local power nodes in the banking system. (Although in both countries the State level regional banks are under attack from monopolists). The Canadian banking system is much more concentrated with less than ten big players, but it is competitive and there are solid cultural factors which make the central bank amenable to political influence to the benefit of citizens. The prospect of China-level centralization of power over all aspects of society I find scary. Although the Chinese have been running their show this way for three thousand years…..mostly successfully. I admit the concept of banking as a public utility has great appeal. How to govern it is the 64 trillion dollar question. I think the exercise of power in all of the countries mentioned involves balancing competition among powerful factions. Putin and Xi both command the ship of their respective states, but I think it a mistake to think that either leader operates without answering to powerful groups. So too here in the US. My understanding of arguments presented in the Federalist Papers was the need for a system to maintain a balance among factions, largely regional in nature, to prevent any one interest from seizing control. The recipe for a successful oligarchy to prevent a monarchy. The US had some experience with a national bank early in its history. It was not universally loved, as many believed that too much financial power was concentrating in the hands of an elite few. An early case of the 1% fearing the formation of the 0.01%? China has modernized most recently, has a large population that was recently rural, and has not devoted much wealth to projecting power outside the country. They have a culture that emphasizes education and the lessons of Europe and US development to learn from. Their particular formula has raised the standard of living of hundreds of millions. Their future may be bright for years to come. But I do not think they have achieved the end of history. Yes, USians are very proud of their constitution’s ‘balance of powers’ amongst the executive, the legislature, and the courts. As readers of NC well know, they conveniently forgot the banks. ‘They’, the sacrosanct Founders. Yes, but banks didn’t have the power that they have now and the threat of national banks or finance taking political power would not be evident for some decades. The Founders were concerned with more obvious problems that had been evident for centuries. Maybe they should have since the problems with bankers having too much influence had been noted or seen before. Just a recognition that the founders saw challenges in their time to maintaining effective governance. What was enacted was a result of argument and compromise and done with the expectation that further work would be needed over time. There were also many arguments over the role of finance and the lessons of the failed first attempt of the articles of confederation. China has found an approach that has worked well so far given where they began. Whether they will adjust effectively as circumstances change is an open question. yeah, ahem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation per Prof Hudson, that right there is the problem,lol. allowing private banks to create money out of nothing. freedumb, and all. China will last longer than us because they kept money creation/destruction in-house. the story i told my boys when they were little, but big enough to ask about where money comes from: welp…you go into the bank, sit down in front of Thom(we all know Thom), present yer bidness plan, etc and he goes into the Inner Sanctum, and waves those documents in front of the stone idol of the Grasshopper God(a computer terminal)…if the Effigy makes the appropriate noises, you are Approved!…and money is soon created from nothing and deposited in your account. when/if you pay it all back, plus interest(of course), that money vanishes from the world. both of them…in their time, and to their credit…came back later, after ruminating…and said something to the effect of:”that sounds a whole lot like what the priest does in church with that cracker”. and i considered the lesson complete, both times. they are both Catholic…which i supported, throughout…but i was allowed my say on things, also throughout. so, likely by my unintended influence/honesty when pressed….neither of them are on board with literal Transubstantiation….Cracker becomes dead god’s flesh for reals. so i doubt that this method would work in more literal and serious christian familas. Indeed, anyone can create money as it is merely an IOU. And as Minsky said, the problem you have is getting it universally accepted. However, private banks are licensees/franchisees of the state with a permit to create money in the currency of the state and not merely in their own unique monetary denomination. So we have, in our western financialised capitalism, the private banks deciding where their credit advances are to be spent. Will that be for risky and difficult to assess productive activities that add to GDP or for asset purchases in the Ponzi marketplace of real estate, stocks and shares? Without any macroprudential regulations mandating where loans are to be made then gambling on assets is the easy short term win for loan managers compensated on loan book size. Structure determines behaviour. “per Prof Hudson, that right there is the problem, lol. allowing private banks to create money out of nothing.” From a different perspective, allowing a multiplicity of small, local banks to create money might just be a pragmatic solution to economic growth provided the type of money locally lent/created is not for asset speculation. China moved from basically one bank to more than 5000 in a short period of time. Thus, the decision of how much money was going to be created and for what purposes was not left to a handful (say 5) bureaucrats at the central bank but, instead, an army of loan officers at the thousands of small local banks. If every bank has 30 branches and each branch employees 35 loan officers, then an army of more than 5 million on the ground experts would decide which company would obtain what amount of money and for what purpose (see writings of Richard A. Werner). its my understanding that that’s pretty much what the New Deal banking regs did….but that no longer obtains, and the banks own the gooberment, now, anyways. and if you were able to gather enough capital and set up a bank, (ie:if They’d let you)…if you started doing populist stuff like making rational loans, the big Banks would soon be upon you, first setting their Regulators on ya, then gobbling you up outright. whole thing needs to burn to the ground…and lamp posts and even guillotines will hafta be used, ere these greedy bastids get the way of the world right. This gives the Marxist state unprecedented influence over its citizens control over the capitalists it permits to exist and whose drive to accumulate it puts to use in selected areas of the productive economy… There, fixed it for you. I think the most accurate portrayal of politics was Veep There ya go. Of course both Veep and House of Cards had British DNA. And Mafia might better describe what is going on in America right now than Putin whose nationalism seems genuine, even if he’s no boy scout. Personally I have my doubts about how serious a threat Silicon Valley is. That was a show too, on HBO. My vote is for “The Candidate” and “Parallax View” for realism and the basis for liberalism. Dollars are private money; yuan is a public money — that’s all there is to this. Can you explain further? There is a lot of confusion about this. The US Congress, which is the representative of the American people (the public), can not issue dollars, it can obtain them through taxation (and the like) or borrow from the private individuals (including foreign). The dollars are made by the private consortium that exists in itself and for itself and is independent from the Congress/President/public. Dollars are made when this consortium lends to outsiders and to itself (e.g., when the FED purchases paper from its member banks; this paper can be anything, including useless mortgage-backed securities). This consortium owns the right to issue dollars and can never go bankrupt in dollar terms — it can always ‘disappear’ bad debt and make new money. Musk and the like borrow money from the consortium (and other sources) like the US government and the rest of us and derives income from selling things (real like cars and not so much like carbon credits), while the Wall Street is part of the consortium and derives their income fully from money mechanics (i.e., interest on debt and probably just money creation disguised as financial engineering). Currently, FED pays interest on bank excess reserves, which is really pure money creation. The FED is not a central bank (as in public), it is the money consortium self-regulation body. The US does not have a central bank. Jerome Powell is the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. From my understanding, China has a public central bank that issues yuan. The Chinese government direct the Central bank to fund the projects of interest and does not need to borrow yuan from private individuals (although it can). From what I understand, Jack Ma attempted to introduce private yuan creation and was shut down. The yuan system can not go bankrupt in yuan terms either. Currency mismanagement whether dollars or yuan will be manifested in low quality of life. The private dollar and the public yuan systems do not mix well and their properties have huge effects on the corresponding economies, whether good or bad. More on this: Public versus Private Sector Money Creation: Society Enhancing Monetary Reform Frank Dixon Fellow, World Academy of Art and Science; Sustainability and System Change Consultant, USA; Author, Global System Change series of books Abstract Nearly all money in the US, UK and many other countries is created by the private sector through lending. Private sector money creation provides many benefits, but also imposes large costs on society. It’s been a long while, but is Victoria describing the private vs public moneys? If you have time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx5Sc3vWefE Yes, although she needs to make a clearer distinction between the two. The US had public money during the New Deal. The last public bank that could issue money closed its doors under Eisenhower. The New Deal had the Pecora Commission, while the 2008 had nothing of the sort. Branco Milanovic recently argued that what is evolving in the U.S. is a new type of capitalism in which the traditional capitalist is being challenged by new households made up of both the labor rich as well as the capital-rich. He argues that this growing cohort is an elite that is resistant to shocks in both labor and capital markets and thus able to maintain their respective positions. They are highly skilled individuals who have attended the best schools and probably feel that they deserve their superior positions. He maintains that many conveniently forget the capital part of their income and focus solely on the labor part for which they studied hard and worked hard. He links three items–ownership of lots of capital, high level of education, and a highly paid job. Thus, instead of a class-based society of the old capitalism, we now have an elite-ruled society that seems to transcend the contradiction between capital and labor and this is the new type of elite in most advanced economies, that now sits at the very top. (His stats on this are amazing.) uhm, labor is what cooks that elite’s food, does his laundry, pilots his private jet, hooks up that IV and nurses him when he’s sick, maybe even guides the robot that’s doing the surgery on his body. And oh yeah, stands guard with automatic weapons outside his house and his place of business. That elite schmuck ain’t laboring. Your mum does the washing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS9Bc_GQBEs&list=RDPS9Bc_GQBEs&start_radio=1 ‘They are highly skilled individuals who have attended the best schools and probably feel that they deserve their superior positions.’ Wasn’t there a report a few months ago of how the top corporations in America are veering away from hiring these very sort as being far too high-maintenance and lazy? And that they get better hires from cow colleges? “It is an elite, resistant to macroeconomic shocks, composed of highly-skilled people who have attended the best schools and probably feel to have deserved their superior position.” https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/new-capitalism-in-america Milanovic also warns that the danger is that this new class in the US will attempt to cement its advantages and turn itself into a de facto hereditary aristocracy. In his Capitalism Alone he points out that both China and the US face this same problem of preventing the emergence of hereditary aristocracy. ‘An ex-KGB agent rises to power, promising to fight the mafia that has taken over the state, but ends up creating his own to maintain control.’ I have a better and more accurate narrative- ‘An ex-KGB agent rises to power, sees that his country is being destroyed by within and without and will soon collapse and break up so decides to play the only way that he can – the Chicago Way.’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjOPLTTjnwc (44 secs) Perfect. And accurate. He didn’t mention all the US operatives assigned desks in various Russian ministries as “advisors”… “An ex-KGB agent rises to power, promising to fight the mafia that has taken over the state, but ends up creating his own to maintain control.” I realise we’re speaking in the abstract, but I don’t remember the prototype promising any such thing. IIRC the story was more like “the mafia that has taken over the state gets its man in the FSB to become their new figurehead, only for him to actually take over and make them play by new rules”. And I haven’t kept up with TV in ages so I may well have missed it but indeed I don’t think there was any show to this effect and it seems unlikely to appear soon. It did show up in fiction literature (Latynina, Pelevin, more obliquely Boris Strugatsky, surely others too), but that’s obviously much safer and less impactful now. I think we did have something like that Turkish show you describe, though. Corruption was and is a popular theme in our television (popular enough that even I would notice there’s a lot of it, I mean). It’s a staple of our numerous cop shows and some other genres too, but I believe it is shown as something that stops at least a little short of the top. Which in a sense is fair, as that is also true for most actual corruption, at least in Russia but probably elsehwere as well; it is a highly decentralised and multipolar world. The power to mint money is and should be the sole prerogative of the sovereign. If it isn’t he and the land he rules over is not sovereign, it is a colony. In the case of US a self – colonized as they haven’t ever known anything else. A Colony is a place where you can exploit the land and people to destruction and then move somewhere else for a new opportunity. I had this revelation (it is rather trivial I agree) when I read Count Potocki’s Saragossa Manuscript a couple of years ago as a new translation had been published. There was a passage there that the Catholic King abolished slavery in The Crown but made an exception for colonies. That’s the origin story of US. An Exception. Nota bene, Potocki had extensive ties to Russian Empire and was an official at the Imperial Court and an envoy to China but this fact is totally absent in Polish Wikipedia entry which I imagine is a recent modification. It can’t be found in the English Wikipedia either, although it does at least mention that he died in the Russian Empire. The Russian Wikipedia does mention his Russian connections and diplomatic employment, though. He was far from alone among prominent Poles who had high standing in Russia, only for this to be downplayed by other Poles later. So it goes. 2D thinking. Geography is strategy. China has more than 100 languages, ethnic minorities and cultures. Truth? What is that? Who observes it? Reification destroys analysis. Interesting that the author makes no mention of Zelensky, who actually was an actor/comedian playing the part of taking over the reins of power in Ukraine in a TV production to fight corruption etc. He then gets elected in real life by an electorate yearning for peace and an end to civil war and fighting Russia who somehow believe he genuinely is the TV character he played. Only once in power, Zelensk goes all in on corruptly enriching himself and his cronies, banning the Russian language and intensifying the civil war and leading to the utter destruction of Ukraine and its population, now either dead, maimed or having fled the country. Given the alternative between the charade of “independent” central banks (which are, by design, aristocratic institutions inimical to labour) and a return to the consolidated treasury answerable directly to my elected representatives, I’ll take the latter, thanks. I realize that this poses a new challenge — forcing our elected representatives to accept the mechanisms and consequences of democratic accountability. But I prefer that fight to the radical centrist neoliberal technocracy we’ve been enduring for far too long now … The US operates under a liberal political philosophy and neoliberal economic philosophy, and China does not. Our liberal ideology values individual rights of the select few over the well being of society as a whole. Government has the role of protecting the individual rights of the select few, which means that government also needs to greatly limit the individual rights of everyone else at the same time. And the neoliberal ideology values the economic well being of those select few over the economic well being of society as a whole. Government has the role of creating the rules for the neoliberal economic system to make this possible. Real political and economic power in the US, even though it resides in only about 0.01% of the US population, is still diffused to over 30,000 individuals, plus their surrogates. That adds up to a whole lot of potential disagreement and division, and that we have in abundance. China is not liberal or neoliberal and therefore is not burdened with the level of disagreement and division that the US has. China’s political system is much more centralized, and in those instances where centralized control and unity are important, they will outperform the US every time. Liberalism has its limits, as it is impossible for everyone to have the superior set of inalienable individual rights that the elite want for themselves. Neoliberal economics has pushed the limits of liberalism far beyond where they have ever been, where the economic well being of 0.01% of the world’s population transcends the overall well being of the remaining 99.99%.

Title: TikTok Will Be Banned in September If China Doesn’t Approve U.S. App Sale, Trump Official Warns

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Howard Lutnick, President Trump’s Commerce Secretary, said TikTok will go dark for the video app’s millions of American users unless China agrees by a Sept. 17 deadline to a deal that will give the U.S. owners majority control over the app. “We’ve made the decision. You can’t have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,” Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” If China doesn’t approve the deal, “then TikTok is going to go dark.” “Basically, Americans will have control” of TikTok in the U.S., Lutnick said. “Americans will own the technology. Americans will control the algorithm. That’s something Donald Trump is willing to do.” Popular on Variety Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. Trump last month issued his third executive order delaying enforcement of the law until Sept. 17 while members of his administration attempt to hammer out a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law — while also being an arrangement the Chinese government will approve. In an interview with Fox News that aired June 29, Trump claimed his administration has identified a group of “very, very wealthy people” who will buy TikTok in the U.S. “I think I’ll need, probably, China’s approval, and I think President Xi [Jinping] will probably do it,” he said in the interview. However, Trump did not reveal who the purported buyers are. Trump told host Maria Bartiromo he would say “in about two weeks” who the buyers are, but to this point there have been such announcements. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. At a congressional hearing in March 2023, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said, “ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and said there is an “inaccurate belief that TikTok’s corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Where to invest $10,000 right now, according to 6 Wall Street heavyweights

If you have $10,000 in cash waiting to be invested, you probably wish you had shoveled that money into the stock market in mid-April. But you're not the first, and won't be the last, investor who missed a good entry point into the market. Even with the market at all-time highs since hitting a bottom in April, that doesn't mean it's a bad time to jump in. Six Wall Street veterans told Business Insider that there are still plenty of pockets of opportunity. Some, for example, still like tech stocks as AI investment booms. Some of those same people also think it's smart to hedge and diversify right now amid the hype and lofty valuations. They recommend allocating some money to areas like value or international stocks. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. Figuring out where to put your money depends on your individual circumstances, like your investment timeline and risk tolerance. For this hypothetical thought exercise, we asked our sources where they themselves would invest the money if they suddenly came into $10,000. Santos said that if she were gifted $10,000 right now, she would invest $7,000 in developed-market ex-US stocks and the remaining $3,000 in emerging-market stocks. "After 15 years of disappointment, it's really been all about international equities this year — huge outperformance, and something we see as just the beginning," Santos said. Santos is still bullish on US stocks, but said that international stocks are primed for relative outperformance given how high valuations are on US stocks. Historically, US stocks have traded at a 15% premium to international stocks, but now trade at a 35% premium. Plus, the value of the US dollar has fallen in recent months, and demand for ex-US assets has risen. "For someone, maybe like me, who's been too concentrated just on the US equity story, I think we've really seen a huge turning point to put some of that money to work overseas finally," she said. Two examples of exchange-traded funds that offer exposure to these areas include the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). Year-to-date, the funds are up 19.7% and 18.6%, respectively. Bannister identified three baskets of opportunities: value stocks, small-caps, and international stocks. For value stocks, he said to go with a large-cap value fund like the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV). For small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) works well for its broad-based nature having exposure to the growth and value factors, Bannister said. And for international stocks, Bannister like the iShares MSCI ACWI ex US ETF (ACWX). These trades provide diversification from a tech-concentrated market, Bannister said. "Right now the market's obsessively focused on tech. But it's hard to run an economy on seven stocks," Bannister said, referring to the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Bannister said he recently put long-term bets on these trades himself. "I actually put a third, a third, a third, into small-cap, international, and value on some money that came in in May that I got, and we'll see how it works out for 10 years," he said. Normally, Smith would simply recommend a broad market index so that your money is well diversified. There's only one problem with that: most main indexes aren't all that diversified at the moment, with the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks making up almost a third of the S&P 500. So Smith has an easy fix: Put 50-60% of the money into an equal-weight S&P 500 fund, like the Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight ETF (RSP), rather than the more widely followed market cap-weighted index. The equal-weight product gives you the same exposure to all 500 companies in the index instead of adjusting for exposure by company size. The equal-weight index has generally underperformed over the last five years, but it would hypothetically suffer less downside in a tech sell-off. The remaining 40-50% of the money can go into a more concentrated cap-weighted index like the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, Smith said. That way, you don't miss out too much if the tech rally keeps ripping. "Now you get all your top tech holdings that are driving this market," he said. Smith's suggestions assume at least a five-year timeline. Unlike Santos, Kantrowitz is still bullish on the American exceptionalism theme and would continue to bet on the US stock market for the next few years. Kantrowitz doesn't have a specific sector slant — he recommends investing in large-cap profitable leaders within their industries. "The earnings backdrop is going to be very bifurcated, and interest rates are going to remain elevated," Kantrowitz said of the next few years. With this backdrop, existing large-cap winners will continue to perform and have better earnings revisions than their peers. Kantrowitz would avoid passive sector indexes like a broad tech ETF, as those often don't accurately reflect the performance of the underlying basket of stocks due to weighting criteria. Instead, he recommends a more active stock-picking approach. The largest names that are screening well in Piper Sandler's models include Big Tech names — unsurprisingly, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta make the list — and companies like Oracle, Costco, Johnson & Johnson, and Home Depot. DeSpirito, who manages several funds with a focus on combining value and quality, would split his investment between large-cap growth companies, dividend stocks, and value stocks. His guiding principle is building a well-diversified portfolio that can weather market volatility, given tariff headlines. The S&P 500 has undoubtedly become more expensive and growth-oriented thanks to the dominance of tech, but it's still a good idea to maintain exposure to Big Tech, according to DeSprito. "I'm not negative on the Mag Seven," DeSpirito said. "Many of them have really good growth and really good free cash flow. That's an incredibly powerful combination, and so they earn the multiples that they're trading at." For diversification, dividend stocks tend to be more resilient during downturns and provide a steady stream of income. DeSpirito is also on the hunt for unloved stocks that are trading cheaply. Healthcare companies are an especially compelling opportunity at the intersection of value and quality, according to DeSpirito. This area of the market has been largely ignored by investors, with the S&P 500 healthcare sector down 2% year-to-date. DeSpirito likes medical device companies, as these trade at mid-teens earnings ratios with good growth prospects. However, some large-cap pharmaceutical companies could be value traps, as their earnings are heavily dependent on patents, DeSpirito warned. For investors with a longer timeline and a higher risk tolerance, Castleton suggested a three-pronged approach in equities. First, plug around 60% of your funds into large-cap stocks with a bias toward tech. Despite its comeback rally after a sharp dip earlier this year, tech is "still one of the areas and sectors that's going to dominate the markets for the next 10 years" given the innovation coming out of the sector, Castleton said. There are multiple ways to get exposure to the tech theme, but some general example funds might include the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). Second, put about 20% of the fund into ex-US stocks. International stocks have gotten a big boost this year amid Trump's trade war and initial pullback from US support in Ukraine, and Castleton thinks the rally can continue. "You have to have some of that diversification because I truly believe going forward that you'll continue to see value coming out of Europe, some of these ex-US players that are now all of a sudden shifting their mentality to spending more on defense, to deregulating their companies," she said. Third, Castleton said to put the remaining 20% into mid-cap stocks, or companies with a market cap between $2 and 10 billion. This can provide further portfolio diversification, Castleton said, but the stocks should also benefit from reshoring as the deglobalization trend continues. "They're more domestically-oriented companies, and they also have a lot more room to grow than the large caps that have already kind of established their business models," she said. Jump to

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming Crypto’s Reserve Asset: New Research
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-crypto-reserve-asset-research/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T13:00:37Z
Full Content:
A new research from analytics firm Artemis argues that Ether is undergoing the same reputational pivot Bitcoin experienced in the mid-2010s, but on fundamentally different terms. “Evaluating ETH purely through the lens of cash flows or protocol fees is a category error,” writes lead author Kevin Li. “It is better understood as a scarce yet productive, programmable reserve asset whose value accrues through its role in securing, settling and powering an increasingly institutionalized on-chain economy.” Li begins by tackling the long-running critique that Ethereum’s flexible monetary policy disqualifies it as a store of value. He models a worst-case scenario in which every ETH in existence is staked and issuance hits its theoretical ceiling. Even then, annual inflation tops out at roughly 1.52 percent in 2025 and decays to 0.89 percent by 2125—well below the US dollar’s 6.36 percent average M2 expansion since 1998 and even beneath gold’s long-run annual supply growth. The paper argues that the combination of sublinear issuance and the EIP-1559 burn has already pushed net inflation near—or periodically below—zero, giving ETH a supply profile that “rivals gold while retaining the programmability of software.” Macro conditions provide the backdrop for the thesis. Artemis notes that decades of monetary expansion have eroded trust in fiat and driven investors toward alternative stores of value. The US consumer-price index has averaged 2.53 percent a year since 1998, but the money supply has grown more than twice as fast, a gap the report claims “may account for a significant share of nominal equity-market gains.” Ethereum’s adaptive monetary policy, Li contends, offers a disciplined alternative without sacrificing the network’s ability to pay validators. Institutional adoption is the second pillar of the argument. Over the past 12 months JPMorgan, BlackRock and Robinhood have each chosen Ethereum rails—either the base layer or an affiliated roll-up—for tokenized deposits, money-market funds and equity trading prototypes. The report cites BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and JPMorgan’s forthcoming JPMD deposit token as proof that blue-chip institutions are no longer experimenting on testnets but building products that will settle value at scale. “As traditional finance migrates on-chain, the need to hold and stake ETH becomes structural rather than discretionary,” Li writes. That dynamic is visible in on-chain data. Artemis calculates that the supply of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets on Ethereum reached a record $123 billion in June, while the amount of ETH locked in validators climbed to 35.5 million. The year-on-year correlation between the value of on-chain assets and staked ETH exceeds 88 percent across every major category the firm tracks, reinforcing the idea that demand for security and settlement drives demand for the native token. Regulation, long the wild card for any staking-based value proposition, has started to tilt in Ethereum’s favor. On May 29 the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance stating that protocol-level staking, delegated staking and certain custodial staking arrangements do not in themselves constitute securities offerings. While the ruling left room for fact-specific enforcement, it cleared the way for spot-ETH ETF filers to include staking provisions in their S-1 amendments. Several prospective issuers have since done exactly that, promising investors both passive exposure to ETH and a share of consensus rewards. The Artemis report also highlights an emerging “treasury-asset wave” reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy in 2020. Sharplink Gaming disclosed in late May that it would begin allocating corporate cash to Ether, a move followed by a cluster of smaller US and Asian public companies. Together they now hold more than 730,000 ETH, or roughly $2.6 billion at current prices. The accumulation has coincided with a period of ETH outperformance versus BTC—an unusual trend in the current cycle, which has otherwise been dominated by Bitcoin narratives such as halving supply shocks and prospective US reserve holdings. Critics who argue that Layer 2 networks cannibalize Ethereum’s fee base “miss the point,” Li says. By off-loading execution while anchoring settlement and data availability to the base layer, roll-ups expand Ethereum’s total addressable market without eroding its security budget. Li compares the arrangement to the Federal Reserve System: “Regional banks handle day-to-day traffic, but ultimate settlement rests with the central bank.” In that analogy ETH is the reserve asset that guarantees finality. The paper concedes that other high-throughput Layer 1s, particularly Solana, have siphoned off “meme-coin velocity” and micro-transaction volume. Solana processed more transactions than Ethereum in five of the past six quarters. Yet Li argues that the market for assets requiring maximal security is “orders of magnitude” larger than the market for speculative trading throughput, especially as traditional finance tokenizes bonds, deposits and money-market funds. Perhaps the most pointed section of the report re-examines Bitcoin’s own “digital gold” narrative. Just as early critiques once dismissed BTC as volatile, illiquid and pointless, ETH today faces doubts about its identity. “Bitcoin users once had to justify why a purely digital bearer asset could compete with gold,” Li writes. “Ethereum users now have to justify why a programmable, yield-bearing, burn-limited asset can compete with bitcoin. The burden of proof is reversing.” After Ethereum’s long-awaited transition to proof-of-stake and barely two months after the SEC’s staking guidance, the conversation around ETH has shifted from “utility token” to something far closer to “reserve asset.” If Li’s thesis holds, future debates may revolve less around whether Ethereum can catch Bitcoin’s market cap and more around what happens when institutions treat Ether not as gasoline for smart contracts but as the base money of the emerging on-chain economy. At press time, ETH traded at $3,585. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: The investment chief at $10 trillion giant Vanguard says it’s time to pivot away from U.S. stocks

Shawn Tully is a senior editor-at-large at Fortune, covering the biggest trends in business, aviation, politics, and leadership. Greg Davis visited Fortune this month dressed like a Wall Street titan—and bearing a very un-Wall-Street message about a tepid future for U.S. stocks.On July 11, Davis––the president and chief investment officer of Vanguard Group––came to our offices in Manhattan’s Financial District for a chat with this reporter. Though Davis works from Vanguard’s mother ship (its buildings are all named for British vessels from the Napoleonic wars) in the tiny hamlet of Malvern, Pa., west of Philadelphia, he arrived attired in a tailored gray suit and purple silk tie combo that would have fit right in with the most formal of the investment banking cadre and portfolio managers headquartered nearby.Yet Davis’s message couldn’t have been more contrary to the fashionable view among the neighborhood’s rosy prognosticators. The 25-year Vanguard veteran’s outlook contradicts the prevailing position advanced by the big banks, research firms, and TV pundits that despite serial years of big gains, U.S. stocks remain a great buy. That bull case rests mainly on optimism that the Big Beautiful Bill’s deregulatory agenda and tax cuts will spur the economy, and that the AI revolution promises a new world of efficiencies that will shift earnings to super-fast track going forward. The powerful momentum that has driven the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to all time highs this week bolster their argument for more to come. Davis follows the Vanguard mindset that, arguably more than any other, revolutionized the investing world over the past half-century. The company’s founder, John Bogle, created the first index funds for ordinary investors in 1975, following the conviction that funds choosing individual stocks regularly fail to beat their benchmarks after fees, and that a pallet of diversified index funds, and later ETFs, that hold expenses to an absolute minimum, provide the best platform for achieving superior gains over the long-term. The top testament to the enduring validity of the Vanguard model: Over 80% of its ETFs and indexed mutual fund beat their peer-group averages over the past 10 years, measured by LSEG Lipper, largely courtesy of those super-tight expense ratios. The Vanguard model’s won such overwhelming favor that it now manages 28% of the combined U.S. mutual fund and ETF universe, and it’s gained 7 points in market share in the past decade. At $10 trillion in AUM, it ranks second only to BlackRock among all U.S. asset managers. Besides offering over 400 super-low-cost funds worldwide, Vanguard also provides investment advice as a firm, and through its army of financial advisers. A big part of the Vanguard formula: Periodically rebalancing from securities that get extremely pricey by historical standards into areas that are undervalued versus their norms. In our discussion, Davis provided a master class on how the dollars in profits you’re getting for each $100 you’re paying for a stock influences future returns, and why now is such a crucial time to shift from what’s highly, even dangerously expensive into safe areas that look like screaming buys. Put simply, Davis argues that U.S. equities are a victim of their own success. For Davis, the fabulous ride in recent years virtually guarantees that future returns will prove extremely disappointing versus outsized, double-digit gains investors have gotten used to, and that the investment pros predict will persist. The reason is simple: U.S. stocks have simply gotten so costly that their forward progress is destined to radically slow. “Our investment strategy group’s projection is that U.S. equity market returns are going to be much more muted in the future,” Davis warns. “Over the past ten years, the S&P returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8% and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade.” The basic market math, he contends, points to that outcome. Davis notes that the official price-to-earnings multiple on the S&P now stands at an extremely lofty 29.3. And when Vanguard uses a preferred gauge based on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller’s Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings multiple, or CAPE––a measure that adjusts the PE by normalizing for spikes and valleys in earnings––it concludes that US stocks hover 49% over the top end of the group’s fair value range. Davis also points out that corporate profits are now extremely high by historical levels, and hence won’t grow nearly as fast from here as their jackrabbit pace of recent years. In other words, don’t count on an EPS explosion to solve the valuation problem. In fact, this reporter notes that contrary to what we’re constantly hearing about forthcoming double-digit increases in profits, the sprint has already slowed to a stroll. From Q4 of 2021 to Q1 of this year, S&P 500 EPS grew from $198 to $217, or 9.6% in over three years, a puny pace that doesn’t even match inflation. Davis explained how the longstanding bull market has wildly distorted the standard “60-40” portfolio. That classic construction of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has worked well in many periods, he notes. But today, folks who started at 60-40 a decade ago, and didn’t rebalance into bonds as equity prices swelled year after year, are now banking far too heavily on those richly-valued U.S. equities. “In the past 10 years, interest rates have mainly been very low, so bonds returned only around 2% a year, or 10% less than stocks,” declares Davis. “So the stock portion kept compounding at a high rate and getting bigger, and the bond portion kept shrinking as a share of the total. As a result, what started as a 60-40 mix is now 80-20 in favor of stocks.” To make matters worse, says Davis, “U.S. stocks outperformed international equities by 6 percentage points a year in the past decade. So 10 years ago, if you started with the standard split 70% U.S. and 30% foreign, you’d now be at 80% U.S. and 20% foreign.” Hence, sans rebalancing, an investor’s overall share of U.S. stocks would have gone from 42% to around two-thirds, a gigantic leap. Those weightings, he says, are lopsided in the wrong direction, in two ways—by holding far too big a percentage of stocks and not enough bonds, and within the equity portion, not owning enough foreign shares. “If you look at the bond market today and the way yields have risen, we’re projecting that you’re going to pick up very similar returns in a mix of U.S. and foreign bonds as you’ll get in U.S. equities, or also 4% to 5%. So the expectations are comparable, but you’ll have much less volatility on the bond side,” avows Davis, adding, “What’s the big advantage to betting on risky stocks when you can get 4.3% on three-month Treasuries?” Hence, Davis makes a daring recommendation: Investors should reverse the classic blend and go with 60% bonds and 40% stocks. For the fixed income portion, he notes, Vanguard’s Total World Bond ETF (BNDW) offers a blend of domestic and international fixed income, encompassing government bonds, corporates, agencies, mortgages, and asset backed securities. In addition, Vanguard projects that foreign shares over the next ten years will generate average returns of 7%, waxing the 5% or so for U.S. equities. Hence, Davis recommends that in the 40% dedicated to stocks, investors lean heavily to the international side by splitting the allocation evenly, or 20% and 20%, between stateside and international stocks. The Vanguard FTSE All World ex US ETF (VEU) would fit the slot reserved for the international allotment. In summary, Davis is advising a radical rebalancing for folks who let their U.S. stocks swallow a bigger and bigger part of their portfolios as bonds and international shares underperformed year after year. So here’s are allocations he’d recommend for the decade ahead: 60% fixed income, 20% international equities, and—gulp—just 20% in U.S. stocks. Once again, that number compares to the around two-thirds you’d hold in U.S. equities if you’d started at 60-40 ten years ago and just let your gains on U.S. stocks rip without any rebalancing. I ran some numbers on the returns you’d garner in the two scenarios: First, if you don’t rejigger and keep holding two-thirds of your portfolio in U.S. stocks, and second, if you do what Davis advocates and put 60% in bonds, and park more of the equity share abroad. In both cases, the projected future return is just over 5% yearly. No big difference in returns over the next decade. So why choose the Davis formula? The edge in making the big shift: The path will be much smoother, predictable, and less nerve-rattling that sticking with a huge over-weighting in U.S. stocks. Of course, Davis recommends rebalancing gradually, and funding as much of it as possible with fresh savings and reinvestment of dividends and high interest payments from fixed income assets. Davis isn’t recommending crypto investing as a means of boosting your returns at a time when U.S. stocks won’t come close to matching their past performance. “I got into this business around the time of the dot.com era,” he told me. “Anything with a dot.com behind it went to the moon. Some were actually really good businesses, however the majority were not. Good things can come out of crypto like blockchain, and that technology can reduce costs in the financial sector and improve speed, so we think there are some good fundamental components to it. But to us investing in Bitcoin is speculation.” For Davis, Bitcoin offers none of the advantages of traditional investments that generate interest payments, or earnings that feed capital gains and dividends. “It’s not investing in a cash flow generating business, it’s not investing in bonds where you have a commitment to getting a coupon payment every six months, then principal at maturity,” he explains. “It’s basically looking to sell to someone willing to pay more than you did. And the whole idea that a limited supply of Bitcoin will drive up its value is questionable when you consider that there’s an unlimited supply of new types of crypto that could be created. So I personally don’t get it. Vanguard won’t launch a Bitcoin fund. We just don’t see it as a core part of an investment portfolio.” Davis grew up on an Army base near Nuremberg, Germany, the child of a father in an Airborne division and a German mother. As a kid, he mainly spoke German, including with his grandmother, and didn’t live in the U.S. until age 7. “When I go to Germany and speak the language, people can tell I’ve kept the Bavarian dialect,” he declares. He started at Penn State pursuing aeronautical engineering, but lack of skill in mechanical drawing forced him to switch—to a major in insurance. “Penn State was one of the few schools that offered that unusual major,” he says. Davis went on to get an MBA at Wharton, and after a brief stint in a Merrill Lynch training program, got an offer from Vanguard that would require a move from Wall Street to the sleepy suburbs of Philly. Davis took the job in part because Vanguard was then a fast-growing shop, where he figured his chances of advancement would be better than at a huge bank or brokerage. He was especially attracted to Vanguard’s highly unusual “cooperative” model, where the funds––meaning the investors––are the shareholders. “So because we have economies of scale where over time our revenues grow faster than expenses, we can rebate that money back to investors by lowering fees,” he says. Davis proudly notes that Vanguard has made 2,000 such reductions in its history, and especially that in February it announced the biggest decrease ever—a cut of $350 million across 68 mutual funds and ETFs in equities and fixed income. Vanguard’s whole approach where the objective is to constantly lower fees is highly un-Wall Street. So is Davis’s contrarian counsel to follow what the valuations and history tells us, to shift from stocks that are extremely expensive and whose prices can’t grow to the sky, despite what the bulls are saying. It’s a sobering, cautionary tale. But it’s one that makes eminent sense. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

EDIMBURGO – Cuando en 2021 se celebró la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático en Glasgow (COP26), Mark Carney era una figura imponente en el mundo financiero. En aquel momento, quien hoy es primer ministro de Canadá (hecho atribuible en gran medida al llamado del presidente de los Estados Unidos Donald Trump a que Canadá se convierta en el 51.º estado) era enviado especial de las Naciones Unidas para la acción climática y las finanzas. En la COP26, Carney anunció la creación de la Alianza Financiera de Glasgow para las Cero Emisiones Netas (GFANZ por la sigla en inglés), que sería madre de tres hijas precoces: la Alianza Bancaria para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZBA), la Alianza de Aseguradoras para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZIA) y la iniciativa de Gestoras de Activos para las Cero Emisiones Netas (NZAM). En opinión de algunos escépticos, todo eso no era más que un montón de ceros; pero Carney aseguró a un mundo expectante que «no es bla bla bla», y que el concepto de cero emisiones netas sería la «infraestructura crítica del nuevo sistema financiero». ¿Qué ha sido pues de la iniciativa de Glasgow con los años? ¿En qué extremo del continuo de «infraestructura crítica bla bla bla» estamos? Hay que decir que el paso del tiempo no ha sido benévolo con la sopa de letras de Carney. A principios de este año, los mayores bancos estadounidenses (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs y el resto) se retiraron de la NZBA, evidentemente temerosos de presiones políticas del nuevo gobierno de Trump. A los grandes bancos estadounidenses se sumaron los canadienses, mostrando escasa lealtad a la creación de quien más tarde sería su primer ministro. Y en abril, los miembros restantes diluyeron los compromisos iniciales: fijaron como nuevo criterio un máximo de 2 °C de aumento de temperaturas (en vez de los ya hace mucho irrelevantes 1,5 °C) y abandonaron el objetivo de llegar a cero emisiones netas en 2050. Pero la hemorragia no terminó allí. Este mes, HSBC anunció su deserción, y parece muy probable que habrá otros. Hoy los miembros representan un poco más de la mitad del patrimonio de los fundadores; pero todavía quedan algunos bancos comprometidos y la NZBA sigue viva. Our Summer Sale has begun.

Subscribe Now No puede decirse lo mismo de su hermana menor, la NZIA. Incluso antes de la elección de Trump, algunos procuradores de estados bajo control republicano, cuestionando la formulación conjunta de objetivos climáticos, acusaron de cartelización a los principales miembros de la entidad. Puede que sus motivos hayan sido más bien distintos, pero tenían un argumento válido desde el punto de vista legal: los fundadores no habían analizado lo suficiente lo que esa formulación conjunta de compromisos implicaba. Tras una serie de retiradas, en abril de 2024 la NZIA colapsó. Ha aparecido una especie de sustituto, el Foro para la Transición de las Aseguradoras a las Cero Emisiones Netas, cuyos miembros están sujetos a obligaciones más laxas y sin formulación de metas ni publicación de información obligatoria. El foro también asegura que tiene abogados internos encargados de vigilar cualquier posible infracción futura de la legislación antimonopolio. Para completar la familia, la tercera hija (NZAM) también experimentó en enero una andanada de retiradas, encabezada por BlackRock, que provocó la suspensión de sus actividades y la cancelación de la lista pública de firmantes. No está claro cuándo terminará la suspensión (si termina). Ya hemos hablado de las hijas; ¿qué ha sido de la madre? Técnicamente, la GFANZ todavía existe, pero tras una remodelación sustancial. Ahora se describe como un «grupo de directores» independiente sin precalificaciones para el ingreso; y ya no apunta a ser guardián del objetivo de cero emisiones netas sino un facilitador de financiación para la transición energética, tarea loable, pero lejos de la imaginada en un principio. Es difícil ver en todos estos hechos tomados en conjunto otra cosa que no sea un debilitamiento significativo del compromiso del sector financiero con el apoyo a la transición verde. Pero ¿dónde están las autoridades regulatorias, que los presionaban para que se pusieran a la altura del desafío y fueran parte de la solución al cambio climático, en vez de convertirse en futuras víctimas? En 2017, ocho bancos centrales formaron la Red para la Ecologización del Sistema Financiero (NGFS), una «coalición de voluntarios» con inclusión del Reino Unido, Francia y China, pero no de Estados Unidos. La Reserva Federal (siempre tan orgullosa de su independencia política) decidió sumarse tras la victoria electoral de Joe Biden en 2020, para retirarse a principios de este año. Pero en este caso, otros bancos centrales siguen comprometidos. Algunos (por ejemplo el Banco de Inglaterra) le restaron importancia a las pruebas de estrés climático, pero los miembros de la NGFS (que ahora son unos 140) no han dejado de creer que el aumento de las temperaturas medias implica riesgo de disrupción económica y que la transición energética creará ganadores y perdedores. Un análisis reciente de la NGFS sugiere que los riesgos económicos son mayores de lo que se pensaba. Si los bancos y las aseguradoras no comprenden lo que está en juego, pueden sufrir efectos negativos, que a las otras amenazas que enfrentamos, les sumarán la inestabilidad financiera. Pero que nadie crea que el resto del mundo puede seguir como hasta ahora. Hay señales inequívocas de que Estados Unidos está presionando a los organismos de regulación internacionales para que le resten importancia a su trabajo en materia climática. El último comunicado del Consejo de Estabilidad Financiera (FSB) señala que «aunque muchos miembros consideran que hay necesidad de hacer más, algunos creen que la labor completada hasta ahora es suficiente», y parece que los «algunos» se han impuesto a los «muchos». También el Comité de Basilea degradó su trabajo en lo referido a la publicación de información relacionada con el clima y eliminó cualquier obligación de cumplimiento. Aunque hay que decir que el Comité de Basilea rechazó un pedido de Estados Unidos de disolver su grupo de trabajo sobre el clima, parece que los representantes estadounidenses ya no asisten a las reuniones, lo que evidentemente disminuye su eficacia. ¿Hacia dónde vamos pues? La evidencia científica indica a las claras que el impacto del calentamiento global en el sector financiero crece día a día, pero la resistencia estadounidense a cualquier acción resultante por parte de las empresas o de las autoridades regulatorias es cada vez más firme. Y como es bien sabido, cuando una fuerza irresistible se encuentra con un objeto inamovible, es muy difícil predecir el resultado. En este caso, mi apuesta es por la fuerza irresistible. Habrá un incidente (tal vez el primero sea en el mundo de los seguros) que nos enseñará la importancia de apuntalar las defensas. Pero aun así, las autoridades regulatorias fuera de Estados Unidos tienen que mantener la presión.

Title: Has Trump Killed Green Finance?

Just four years ago, the world's banks, insurers, and asset managers were pledging to align their operations with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions, in order to mitigate the risks to financial stability posed by climate change. Now, however, those pledges have been sharply curtailed, owing to US pressure since January. EDINBURGH – At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26), back in 2021, Mark Carney bestrode the financial world like a colossus. Now Canada’s prime minister, thanks in large part to US President Donald Trump’s call to make the country America’s 51st state, in 2021 he was the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. At COP26, Carney announced the creation of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the parent of three precocious children, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. All that amounted to a whole lot of zeros, in the view of some sceptics, but Carney assured an expectant world that “It’s not blah blah blah,” and that net zero would form the “critical infrastructure of the new financial system.” So, how well has the Glasgow initiative aged? At which end of the critical infrastructure-blah blah blah spectrum do we find ourselves? The intervening years have not been kind to the alphabet soup Carney cooked up. At the beginning of this year, the biggest US banks – JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and the rest – pulled out of the NZBA, clearly fearing political pressure from Trump’s new administration. The big US banks were soon followed by the Canadian banks, showing little loyalty to their future prime minister’s creation. In April, the remaining members watered down the initial commitments, focusing on alignment with a maximum 2º Celsius temperature rise, rather than the long mooted 1.5ºC, and abandoning the target of full net-zero compliance by 2050. But that did not stem the flow of departures. Earlier this month, HSBC announced its defection, and it seems highly likely that others will do likewise. Today the members represent only a little over half the assets of the founders, but there are still some committed banks, and the NZBA remains alive. Our Summer Sale has begun. Get more access to Project Syndicate, starting at less than $5 per month for your first year. Click the button below to view our subscription offerings. Subscribe Now That is more than can be said for its little sister, the NZIA. Even before Trump’s election, some attorneys general from Republican-controlled states, raising concerns about collaborative climate pledges, had targeted the major members on antitrust grounds. Their motives might have been rather different, but legally they had a point. The founders had not properly thought through the implications of the pledges they were making. After a spate of withdrawals, in April 2024 the NZIA collapsed. There has been a replacement of sorts, in the form of the Forum for Insurance Transition to Net Zero. The forum’s membership obligations are more flexible, and there are no targets or reporting obligations. It also claims to have armed itself with in-house lawyers to guard against any potential future contraventions of antitrust law. To complete the set, the third child, the NZAM, also experienced a spate of withdrawals in January, led by BlackRock. That led to a suspension of its activities, and the removal of its published list of signatories. It is not clear when, if ever, the suspension will be lifted. We have accounted for the children, but what about the parent? GFANZ still technically exists, but has been substantially remodeled. It now describes itself as an independent “Principals Group” with no pre-entry qualifications, and has shifted its focus from being a net-zero gatekeeper to becoming a facilitator of finance to fund the energy transition – a worthy task, but far from what was initially envisaged. It is hard to see these developments, taken together, as anything other than a significant watering down of the financial sector’s commitment to supporting the green transition. But where are the regulators, who were exerting pressure on their charges to step up and ensure that they were part of the climate-change solution, rather than being casualties of the problem? The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was created by a coalition of eight willing central banks in 2017. The coalition included the United Kingdom, France, and China, but not the United States. After Joe Biden’s election in 2020, the Federal Reserve, which prides itself on its political independence, decided to join, only to withdraw earlier this year. But in this case, other central banks remain committed. Some, like the Bank of England, have de-emphasized their climate stress-tests, but NGFS members, now numbering some 140, still believe that rising average temperatures threaten economic disruption, and that the energy transition will create winners and losers. Recent analysis by the NGFS suggests that the economic risks are greater than previously thought. If banks and insurers do not understand the implications, they may be adversely affected, adding financial instability to the other threats we face. It would be idle to imagine, though, that the rest of the world can continue as before. There are unmistakable signs that the US is putting pressure on international regulatory bodies to downgrade their climate-related work. The last communiqué from the Financial Stability Board noted that “while many members feel there is a need for more work, some feel that the work completed to date is sufficient,” and it seems that the “some” have dominated the “many.” Similarly, the Basel Committee has downgraded its work on climate-related disclosures and removed any requirement to comply. The Basel Committee did refuse a US request to disband its climate task force, but the US representatives reportedly simply do not turn up, which clearly impacts its effectiveness. So, where do we go from here? All the scientific evidence suggests that the impact of global warming on the financial sector is growing relentlessly, but US resistance to any resulting action by firms or their regulators is becoming firmer. The outcome of a clash between an irresistible force and an immovable object is notoriously hard to predict. In this case, my bet is on the irresistible force. A bad outcome, perhaps first in the insurance world, will illustrate the importance of shoring up our defenses. But even then, non-US regulators need to keep up the pressure.

Title: Crypto Prices Dump as FTX Plans September Payout: $SNORT Is a Smart Buy Now

The entire crypto market is on a down-drift after what seems to be a prolonged market correction, forcing Bitcoin down to $118,148 after a 0.40% slip over the past 24 hours. While there are multiple proposed reasons for the current market shift, one of them seems to connect to FTX’s payment plan set to come into effect in September. The now-defunct exchange will release another court-approved payment round of at least $1.9B through the same third-party entities: Kraken, Payoneer, and BitGo. This marks the third big payout in 2025 as part of FTX’s efforts to repay their creditors and redistribute $14.5B in damages. FTX’s upcoming payment could explain, at least in part, the current market shift by digging up the doubt and fear linked to the disgraced exchange, following Sam Bankman-Fried’s scam. An even bigger factor for the current market sentiment seems to be Bitcoin’s $86M in outflows, with BlackRock ($IBIT) and Fidelity ($FBTC) bearing most of the burden, with $142.48M and $227.24M respectively. Trader T is the bearer of bad news, keeping track of Bitcoin’s performance and highlighting the three consecutive days of consistent outflows. The outflows aren’t bad on their own, but their impact on the market is. Entities like Fidelity, for instance, may be forced to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings to cover the withdrawals, which could increase the sell pressure, amplify price volatility, and push market sentiment even lower. But what are the triggers behind this sudden market shift, given that FTX’s payment plan couldn’t account for it on its own? Several factors may contribute to the current market shift: However, while the market is on the back foot, it’s unlikely to backpedal for too long. The Fear and Greed Index is already telling half the story, with the community sentiment still borderline extremely greedy. Trader Tardigrade seems to nourish similar sentiments, stating that, based on the market’s performance, crypto is set to become the largest asset in the world. Another crypto analyst, Titan of Crypto, hints at a second Breakout coming, which would be the final hurdle before Altcoin Season 3.0. With the market winding for a coming rally, some assets may experience higher gains than others, especially those with blockchain utility and massive long-term potential. Snorter Token is one of them, introducing the Snorter Bot, the trading companion which snipes hot tokens milliseconds after liquidity appears. Snorter Token’s ($SNORT) Snorter Bot promises to become the most proficient coin hunter, thanks to its ease of use, integrated scam alerts, protecting against suspicious projects, and its appetite for hot and booming tokens. The Aardvark sniper is the perfect solution to manual coin hunting, which demands high technical knowledge and subjects you to potential scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot operates in its Telegram chat-only, centralizing its activity in one place and rendering the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions obsolete. You only need to instruct the Bot accordingly and watch it claim its victims milliseconds after liquidity becomes available. This reaction time puts UIs like Raydium, Pump Fun, and Jupiter to shame. Based on these facts, Snorter Token is set to become one of the best meme coins on the market, following successful implementation and witnessing widespread adoption. The project is currently in presale, having accumulated over $2.3M with a token price of $0.0991. Given Snorter Bot’s roadmap and efficiency, we expect the project to witness growing success post launch. In that context, $SNORT could easily push to $0.94 shortly after its public listing. If you want to support the project and buy yourself some $SNORT, go to the presale page and place your order today. Despite the heavy Bitcoin outflows and the perceived market uncertainty, the bullish market sentiment seems to suggest that what we’re seeing is not recession, but rather market correction, following the recent generalized rally. We expect Bitcoin to push again soon, once it clears the psychological threshold of $120K, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will also steam up.

Title: Inside Private Equity’s $29 Trillion Retirement Savings Grab
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/07/24/private-equitys-29-trillion-retirement-savings-opportunity-under-trump/

ByHank Tucker andSergei Klebnikov ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff andSergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. Jack Bogle became a legend by popularizing low-cost passive index funds at the Vanguard Group, which he founded in 1975 after spending the first 23 years of his career at Wellington Management. “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack,” he famously mused. That philosophy—be the market, don’t try to beat it—spawned generations of index fund-loving, buy-and-hold “Bogleheads” who have made Vanguard into what it is today: a $10 trillion-in-assets mutual fund colossus serving more than 50 million individual customers. Over the same half-century, private equity was also growing into a more than $10 trillion-in-assets industry—in a very different way. This one was built on the promise of market-beating returns produced by managers demanding high fees: usually a percent of assets (typically 2% a year) and a hefty cut of profits (typically 20%). Plus they insisted on a long-term commitment of assets by their institutional investors, inclu­ding pension funds, college endowments and foundations. Vanguard, which Bogle set up to be owned by its investors, has produced a lot of prosperous retirees but zero money-manager billionaires. Private equity, with its profit share (known as carried interest), has minted dozens of them. Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and cofounder of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity manager with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, is worth an estimated $50 billion. So it was a bit jarring, culturally and historically speaking, when Vanguard and Wellington announced in April that they had formed a “strategic alliance” with Blackstone to offer products for individual investors blending private and public market assets. Jarring but maybe not so surprising given that the heavyweights of private equity and retail distribution are now pairing off with an urgency that suggests they’re desperate to avoid missing out on the next big moneymaking opportunity: getting into Americans’ 401(k)s and IRAs, which hold $29 trillion in assets. And the Trump administration aims to help them. In February, Boston’s State Street Investment Management, which created the exchange-traded-fund business back in 1993, kicked off the action by offering the first ETF with a mix of public and private debt, with the latter sourced from private equity giant Apollo Global ($785 billion under management). Then, a couple months later, State Street announced the launch of an “Index Plus” retirement target date fund series—90% index funds with a 10% kicker of Apollo private market assets. In May, Empower, a top player in the market for small-company 401(k)s, said it’s working with Apollo, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs and others to offer retirement savers collective investment trusts containing a mix of private equity, private credit and real estate. And in July, Voya Financial, another big 401(k) player, announced it was teaming up with private credit’s Blue Owl Capital on a new series of blended products. There’s no mystery why private asset mana­gers are keen to play. After years of beating public stock markets, private equity’s average annual return has lagged stocks by more than three points over the last three years (see “Turn of Fortunes”). A slowdown of exit deals has led to a glut of aging assets in private equity funds. New funds raised by the industry have plunged 39% since 2021 as clients have fewer payouts to reinvest and some college endowments and pension funds are free­zing or even reducing their private asset allocations (see “A Slowing Spigot”). Private asset managers have been gathering money from high-net-worth individuals for more than a decade. Until now, though, they haven’t cracked regular investors’ $29 trillion retirement nest egg—$12 trillion in defined contribution workplace plans like 401(k)s and $17 trillion sitting in individual retirement accounts. That’s now changing. Crucially, President Joe Biden’s Department of Labor threw cold water on private assets in 401(k)s, but President Donald Trump is reportedly close to signing an executive order specifically encouraging alternative assets in the accounts. The mutual fund and retail distribution companies see a win here too. Their margins have shrunk as competition and the share of money in low-cost index funds have grown. A private-assets kicker is a new way to differentiate their offerings and charge higher fees. Ordinary investors? They may or may not be winners. More options are almost always a good thing, but they need to be careful of higher fees and less liquidity. Plus, assessing the performance of these new hybrid private products will be difficult. In an interview with Forbes in June 2017, a year and a half before his death at 89, Bogle wasn’t giving any ground. “The idea of making money for the funds’ shareholders is counter-opposed to the idea of making money for fund managers,” he declared. Wellington Management CEO Jean Hynes, ensconced in an office on the top floor of a 31-story tower overlooking Boston Harbor, likes the long view: The 56-year-old has spent her entire career at the firm. She was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton as one of six children born to Irish immigrants—her father was a bricklayer—who believed, she says, in investing through their children; they spent their money sending them to Catholic school and college. Hynes wound up at Wellesley College, where she majored in economics and interned for a local stockbroker. After graduating in 1991, she was hired by Wellington as an administrative assistant. Her detailed notes at morning investing meetings impressed the late Ed Owens, who managed the Vanguard Health Care Fund to a 16.4% average annual return over 28 years before retiring in 2012. Hynes became his research assistant, protégé and, eventually, a fund manager herself. “It was a match made in heaven from day one,” she says. “He’s probably one of the top 25 investors of all time, and that’s who I learned from and worked with for 20 years.” After winning the CEO job in 2021, Hynes got some advice from health care chiefs she knew. Merck’s Ken Frazier (now retired) told her that of all the decisions he made daily as CEO, only four really mattered. The lesson: Get the big swings right. Hynes sees the alliance with Blackstone as one of those big decisions. She ticks off the trends she has seen—actively managed equity, an explosion of fixed income, the dominance of index funds and, now, alternative investments. And she makes a credible case for why Main Street investors might want to get into private assets. “If you look holistically at the economy, 20 years ago the average person who invested and bought mutual funds could invest in the whole economy. And that’s not true today,” she says. “You have a whole part of the economy that is only for the institutional investor, and that’s all the private companies.... It’s fair that more individuals have access to that.” While Wellington has always been an active manager, it is deeply intertwined with Vanguard’s low-cost passive investing DNA. The relationship dates to Bogle’s firing as Wellington’s CEO in 1974 during a brutal bear market. A boardroom fight and peace treaty eventually left him in charge of a new company (Vanguard) that would administer funds, while Wellington controlled investment management and distribution. Bogle told Forbes in 2017 that he launched low-cost index funds and direct-to-consumer sales in part because it allowed him to do an end run around Wellington by claiming there was no money management or distribution involved. A half-century later, Wellington is still the largest external advisor for Vanguard’s actively managed funds. The Vanguard Wellington Fund, the nation’s oldest balanced mutual fund (two-thirds stocks, one-third bonds) has returned an average of 8.3% annually since inception in 1929. It charges a modest 0.25% of assets and has $115 billion in assets. While Wellington has dabbled in private markets for a decade, they still amount to only $9 billion of the $1.2 trillion in assets it manages, less than 0.8%. So last year, when Hynes was ready for her big swing, Wellington approached Blackstone about teaming up. “We’ve never thought that we would be good at buyouts, taking a company private and managing a company and fixing it. That’s not our skill set,” says Wellington managing partner Terry Burgess, who supervises the team tasked with steering the alliance’s funds. Its first product, the WVB All Markets Fund, is a closed-end “interval fund”—meaning it will offer quarterly redemptions to investors for liquidity and could be the centerpiece of a diversified portfolio. Public stocks (from Vanguard funds and direct Wellington investments) will be 40% to 60% of assets; bonds (through actively managed Vanguard funds) will be 15% to 30%; and private Blackstone funds will make up 25% to 40%. Wellington will determine exactly how assets are allocated. The preliminary prospectus leaves the door open for exposure to private equity, credit, real estate and privately owned infrastructure. It doesn’t specify what the management fee will be, but it will be on top of the fees in the underlying funds. If the overall fund is down in value due to a decline in the public markets, Wellington will reimburse it for Blackstone’s performance fees—that way, retail investors sitting on losses from WVB wouldn’t get whacked with a stiff performance fee regardless. The WVB Fund will be marketed first to wealthy clients through financial advisors and family offices. But all eyes are on the 401(k) prize. “Do I think over time, privates will start to serve more of a role when it comes to target date funds? I do,” says Vanguard president and chief investment officer Greg Davis, noting that the timing will depend on how comfortable plan sponsors (meaning employers) are with adding higher-cost products to their offerings. It’s notable that across the industry, the new private asset–tinged investments are being sold first to accounts managed by financial advisors and to target date funds, which are managed by investment pros, with allocations based on a saver’s expected (i.e., target) retirement date. “It’s a simple equation,” Vanguard founder Jack Bogle told Forbes in 2017. “Gross return minus costs equals net return, which is a universal principle in investing that I put to work after a long struggle.” Target dates are an obvious entry point for two reasons. First, they’re growing like crazy. Thanks to Congress and regulators, millions of workers are being automatically enrolled in 401(k)s, with their contributions (and employer matches) funneled into target dates by default. According to Morningstar, over the last 15 years, assets in these funds have grown at an astounding 30% annual compound rate and now amount to $4 trillion. Vanguard controls 37% of the target date market, more than double the share of its nearest competitor, Fidelity Investments. The second reason is that professional management of target dates blunts the criticism that average investors won’t be able to judge the performance of hard-to-value private assets. “I think over time, just like there are Morningstar ratings of all sorts of public mutual funds, when you look out five, ten years from now, all these funds are going to be ranked based on performance,” says Jonathan Gray, Blackstone’s president and chief operating officer. “That is critically important.” Private equity pioneer KKR launched in 1976 with cash from an insurance company and wealthy backers. But by 1978, it had money from Oregon’s public pension plans, and others soon followed. Today, public pensions allocate an average 23% of assets to alternative investments, the National Association of State Retirement Administrators reports. College endowments began piling aboard after David Swensen took over Yale’s endowment in 1985 and bolstered returns by diversifying into private assets. Today, endowments allocate an average 26% of assets to private markets, accor­ding to Cambridge Associates. Harvard has 39% in private equity; Princeton has 41%. Now some of these traditional sources are pulling back. As America’s richest colleges face deep federal funding cuts and a federal tax as high as 8% (up from 1.4%) on endowment income, Yale, Harvard and others are said to be selling private equity investments on the secondary market. The University of California system is cutting back on its target allocation for private investments in its endowments and pension funds, even as it is working with State Street to make private assets available in employees’ retirement savings plans. Traditional pension plans, particularly private ones, are diminishing in relative importance as employers shift the retirement burden to workers. Back in 2000, traditional pensions—public and private combined—held roughly the same $5 trillion as 401(k)s and IRAs. Now it’s $12 trillion and $29 trillion, respectively, according to the Investment Company Institute. Private asset managers have been wooing financial advisors and their wealthy clients with perpetual capital funds, which often allow up to 5% of investors to cash out each quarter. An early example was the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017. It now has $53 billion in net assets. Blackstone Private Credit Fund, launched in 2021, has $72 billion. All told, Blackstone manages $270 billion from individuals, and this market is growing with a boost from cloud-based platforms for investment advisors. Example: BlackRock, which manages $12.5 trillion in assets, recently teamed up with fintechs GeoWealth and iCapital to create model portfolios holding both private and public assets. Joan Solotar, Blackstone’s head of global private wealth, says most individual investors in private markets have $5 million or more in investable assets, but those with at least $1 million are now being actively targeted. “It’s still quite early for investors below a million dollars,” she adds. Except when it comes to 401(k)s and target date funds. This does not come without risk. In a recent report, Moody’s laid out a series of worries about the push to put private assets into ordinary Americans’ portfolios. A big one is that Main Street investors, used to quick access to their cash, will create liquidity risks. “These fund structures haven’t really been tested extensively at periods of market stress,” says Alexandra Aspioti, a Moody’s senior private credit analyst. “Retail investors tend to be more sensitive to market volatility and increase redemption requests during periods of stress—this in turn can lead to further volatility.” Another worry Moody’s describes: All those extra dollars sloshing around will encourage private asset managers to make dumber deals, particularly in credit. The credit risk is real and growing. Private lenders face fewer regulatory requirements than traditional banks, which is largely why they financed 77% of private equity buyouts last year, according to Preqin. Private loans don’t trade and are valued only quarterly, with estimates that are often well off the mark. The International Monetary Fund warned last year that private lenders’ connections to private equity-backed companies could allow systemic problems to go undetected for too long. As for retail investors and liquidity risk, there have already been scares. Blackstone had to limit redemption requests in its real estate income trust in late 2022 and most of 2023 when individuals spooked by rising interest rates raced for the exits. The market rebounded, and Blackstone is back to honoring 100% of repurchase requests, but there’s little assurance that a similar situation won’t result in a future crash. Another concern: As exit deals from private equity funds have slowed, a fast-growing secondary market, including so-called continuation funds, has emerged, with a record $160 billion in transaction volume in 2024. With continuation funds, asset managers in essence are using new investors’ money to pay off old ones. Orlando Bravo, cofounder and managing partner of $184 billion (assets) Thoma Bravo, has cautioned that in this financial game of musical chairs, retail investors who are late to the party might get saddled with continuation funds with underperforming, hard-to-sell assets. Wellington’s Burgess promises that individual investors in the Wellington-Vanguard-Blackstone product will have access to the same private funds as Blackstone’s institutional clients—not the rejects. And he insists that the proposed fund will be able to withstand waves of withdrawal requests. “There’s 70% of it that’s public, and that’s a really big buffer to make sure you can maintain your liquidity profile,” he says. “We’ve tested it in [severe] down markets, and it’s gone to a level that’s still below what we would consider to be a pain point.” Then there are the objections raised by the Biden administration: that private assets might be too expensive and complex for 401(k)s. “These products are harder to understand and harder to value—it’s very different from looking at individual stocks traded on the public market or mutual funds,” says Lisa Gomez, who served under Biden as the Department of Labor’s assistant secretary for employee benefits security. But private asset managers are betting that the Trump administration will dismiss such worries and are hoping it—and the Republican Congress—will provide some protection from worker lawsuits for employers who offer the new products in their 401(k)s. That could further line the pockets of the wealthiest people in finance. It also could be great for individual investors, who will no longer be locked out of the type of lucrative private investments that have made the nation’s colleges and pension plans so rich for so long. With so much information soon to be available at their fingertips, retail investors might prove to be smarter than Wall Street thinks. They need to keep an eye on fees, and there is risk, for sure. But blue-chip financials like Blackstone, Vanguard and Wellington are going to be extra-careful not to saddle retirement savers with lousy private investments, thereby damaging their brands. Other outfits might be less cautious—caveat emptor—but democratizing investing is well worth the attendant dangers.

Title: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Is Outsourcing More of His Office’s Work to Costly Private Lawyers

Despite having an office with hundreds of attorneys, Ken Paxton frequently opts to hire private lawyers. One cost taxpayers more than $24,000 in one day. This article is co-published with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published. Also, sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. One day in late May 2024, lawyer Zina Bash spent 6 1/2 hours working on a case against Facebook parent company Meta on behalf of the state of Texas. She reviewed draft legal filings. She participated in a court-ordered mediation session and then discussed the outcome with state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In her previous job as senior counsel on Paxton’s leadership team, that labor would have cost Texas taxpayers $641. But Bash had moved to private practice. Paxton hired her firm to work on the Meta case, allowing her to bill $3,780 an hour, so that day of work will cost taxpayers $24,570. In the past five years, Paxton has grown increasingly reliant on pricey private lawyers to argue cases on behalf of the state, rather than the hundreds of attorneys who work within his office, an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica found. These are often attorneys, like Bash, with whom Paxton has personal or political ties. In addition to Bash, one such contract went to Tony Buzbee, the trial lawyer who successfully defended Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges. Three other contracts went to firms whose senior attorneys have donated to Paxton’s political campaigns. Despite these connections and what experts say are potential conflicts of interest, Paxton does not appear to have recused himself from the selection process. Although he is not required to by law, this raises a concern about appearing improper, experts who study attorneys general said. Paxton appears to have also outsourced cases more frequently than his predecessors, available records show. And he’s inked the kind of contingent-fee contracts, in which firms receive a share of a settlement if they win, far more often than the attorneys general in other large states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania. Since 2015, the New York and California attorneys general have awarded zero contingent-fee contracts; Pennsylvania’s has signed one. During that period, Paxton’s office approved 13. One of those was with Bash’s firm, Chicago-based Keller Postman, at the time known as Keller Lenkner, which she joined as partner in February 2021 after resigning from her job at the attorney general’s office. Paxton had signed a contract with the company two months earlier to investigate Google for deceptive business practices and violations of antitrust law. A little more than a year later, Bash’s firm won a state contract to work on the Meta litigation, alleging its facial recognition software violated Texans’ privacy. This time, Bash was the co-lead counsel. Meta, which called the lawsuit meritless, settled the case for $1.4 billion in the summer of 2024. It was a windfall for Keller Postman. The firm billed $97 million, the largest fee charged by outside counsel under Paxton’s tenure. Bash’s work alone accounted for $3.6 million of that total. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Bash, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, said in a statement she is honored the attorney general’s office partnered with Keller Postman based on the firm’s “first-rate attorneys and extensive experience.” “We have a record of taking on the most significant litigation in the country against the most powerful defendants in the world,” Bash said. Keller Postman did not respond to a request for comment. There is little to stop Paxton, or any other occupant of his office, from handing these contracts out. The attorney general can award them without seeking bids from other law firms or asking anyone’s permission. Asked to provide competitive-bid documents for the contingent-fee contracts it has awarded, the attorney general’s office said it had none because state law “exempts the OAG from having to do all of the solicitation steps when hiring outside counsel.” Given the high-profile nature of representing an attorney general and the potential for a big payday, many qualified firms would be eager to compete for this work, said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who studies attorneys general. “I’d be curious to know what the justification is for this not going on the open market,” Nolette said. Paxton declined interview requests for this story. He has publicly defended the practice of hiring outside law firms, arguing that his office lacks the resources in-house to take on massive corporations like tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. “These parties have practically unlimited resources that would swamp most legal teams and delay effective enforcement,” Paxton told the Senate finance committee during a budget hearing in January. A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that the outside lawyers hired by the office are some of the best in the nation. With the contingent-fee settlements to date, more than $2 billion, the state “could not have gotten a better return on its investment,” the statement said. Chris Toth, former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, questioned why so much extra help is needed. Outside counsel is appropriate for small states, he said, that “only have so many lawyers with so many levels of expertise.” The Texas attorney general’s office, one of the largest in the country, has more than 700 attorneys. “Large states typically don’t hire outside counsel,” Toth said. “They should have the people in-house that should be able to go toe-to-toe with the best attorneys that are out there.” When a Texas attorney general previously made a practice of giving lucrative contracts to private counsel, it didn’t end well. Dan Morales was the last Democrat to hold the office. He became embroiled in scandal after he used outside firms to help secure a $17 billion settlement in Big Tobacco litigation in 1998. Republicans, including then-Gov. George W. Bush, blasted the $3.2 billion payout to the outside lawyers as exorbitant. Their attacks grew more intense when Morales sought to steer $500 million of that sum to a lawyer, a personal friend, who did very little work on the case. Morales pleaded guilty in 2003 to related federal corruption charges. He served 3 1/2 years behind bars. John Cornyn, the Republican who succeeded Morales in 1999, criticized his predecessor’s handling of the tobacco case during his campaign for the office. In an interview for this story, Cornyn said he never hired outside counsel as attorney general because he focused on recruiting talented in-house lawyers that he felt could handle all the office’s cases. Paxton is challenging Cornyn, now a four-term U.S. senator, in next year’s Republican primary. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the office after Cornyn, appears to have rarely used private lawyers. The attorney general’s office was able to produce records for only part of Abbott’s 12-year term because state law allows the files to be deleted after so many years. The office signed nine outside counsel contracts between 2010 and 2014, all pro bono or for hourly rates rather than contingency. Abbott did not respond to an interview request. Paxton also seldom outsourced cases during his first five years in office. Through 2019, he awarded only nine outside counsel contracts, all pro bono or hourly rate. The most expensive contract capped fees at $500,000 — far less than $143 million the state paid to the two firms, including Bash’s, that handled the Meta case. He changed course in 2020. That summer, the attorney general’s office was gearing up to file its first case against Google. It related to allegations that the company monopolized the online advertising market, raising costs for advertisers, who increased the price of their products for average consumers as a result. Paxton initially had no plans to hire outside counsel for the litigation, three former deputy attorneys general told the Tribune and ProPublica. But before the case was filed, the attorney general’s office was thrown into upheaval. At the end of September, seven of Paxton’s senior advisers reported him to the FBI, concerned his relationship with an Austin real estate investor had crossed the line into bribery and corruption. State House members would later impeach Paxton on counts related to the accusations; state senators eventually acquitted him. The federal criminal investigation into Paxton did not result in any criminal charges. Over fall 2020, each of the lawyers in his office who had accused Paxton of wrongdoing quit or was fired. That included Darren McCarty, the head of civil litigation who was supposed to lead the Google litigation before he reported his boss to the FBI. He resigned on Oct. 26. Less than two months later, on Dec. 16, Paxton signed contracts with The Lanier Law Firm and Keller Postman to investigate Google. They filed the lawsuit against the tech giant in federal court the same day. Paxton replaced the lawyers who complained to the authorities. The staffing of the antitrust and consumer protection divisions, which would have handled these cases, remained constant at more than 80 employees in the following years. Yet Paxton continued to outsource lawsuits against large corporations to private lawyers. Under Keller Postman’s contract, the firm would be paid only if it secured a settlement or won at trial. These contingent-fee cases have the potential to be far more profitable for the outside firms than those in which they bill at a regular hourly rate. In a successful case, the contracts say that firms are paid either a percentage of a settlement or the sum of hours billed by the firm times four, whichever is less. In the Meta case, Keller Postman was entitled to 11% of the state’s settlement, a share that totaled $154 million. But because the firm’s fees and expenses totaled $97 million, it billed that sum. In multiple legislative sessions, Paxton has testified that outsourcing was the only way his office could stand toe-to-toe with corporate titans. If Paxton has a shortage of qualified in-house attorneys, Cornyn told the newsrooms, that’s because of the damage the whistleblower scandal did to the reputation of the attorney general’s office as a home for ambitious young lawyers. “He’s a victim of his own malfeasance and mismanagement because people did not want to work for him anymore,” Cornyn said. “And if you run off your best lawyers because you engage in questionable ethical conduct, then you’re left with very few options. But this shouldn’t be a way to reward bad behavior.” Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said he was surprised Paxton began hiring contingent-fee outside lawyers only after the scandal, since those contracts, with their potential for high profits, are tougher to ethically defend. “I would have thought it would have been the other way around — that he got more careful after he got the whistle blown on him,” said Goddard, a Democrat. “But it looked like he got more reckless.” Paxton’s style of procurement also benefited Buzbee, the man who successfully defended him during his impeachment trial, which stemmed from allegations the whistleblowers raised. The attorney general chose to skip most of the proceedings, so for the 10 days of trial in the Texas Senate, his most vociferous advocate was the loquacious Buzbee. The pair sat side by side when the attorney general did attend. A little more than a year later, Paxton hired The Buzbee Law Firm to pursue an antitrust suit against the investment firms BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard that accuses the companies of manipulating the coal market in a way that allegedly increased electricity prices for Texans. The firms deny wrongdoing. Buzbee is a successful litigator and one of Houston’s most famous plaintiffs’ attorneys. Among other victories, he won settlements for victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and $73 million for Gulf of Mexico oil drillers in a 2001 antitrust case. But he’s known primarily for personal injury work, not antitrust litigation. His firm, one of two hired for this latest attorney general’s office contingent-fee case, could collect 10% of any judgment or settlement. The case is in its early stages, though the Trump administration in May filed a brief in the case in support of Texas. Buzbee downplayed the potential for a big payday in an email to the newsrooms and argued there is no buddy system at play, noting he believed other law firms also interviewed with Paxton’s office for the job. (The attorney general’s office did not confirm this.) He said his firm has to pay for significant expenses up front, without any guarantee of payment. “The current arrangement may be a good deal for other lawyers, but in all candor, it’s not for me,” Buzbee said, adding that his normal hourly rate is $2,250. “Frankly, the only reason I’m even doing it is that I am proud to represent the state in such a landmark case.” The connections between Paxton and the lawyers he has hired also extend to other firms. The attorney general’s office hired the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the largest in the country with more than 3,000 lawyers on staff, to work on separate Google cases for the state, focusing on consumer protection allegations. The attorney general’s office has awarded three contracts to the firm since 2022 for cases against the tech giant. Three times during that period, Joseph Graham, the firm’s lead counsel on the Google litigation, contributed $5,000 to Paxton’s campaign for attorney general. Twice, the donations came within 16 days of Graham signing one of the firm’s contracts with the attorney general. The firm and its attorneys have contributed $39,500 to Paxton’s campaign since he took office. Neither Graham nor Norton Rose Fulbright responded to requests for comment. Mark Lanier, founder of The Lanier Law Firm, which the state hired to work on a separate Google case, is a large donor to Texas elected officials. He has contributed $31,000 to Paxton’s campaigns since 2015. The largest contribution, for $25,000, came six months after Lanier signed his firm’s Google contract. The Lanier contract is slightly different from the others the attorney general’s office awarded, in that the firm’s payment is partially based on a basic hourly rate but it could also be paid more if it wins the case, as in the contingent-fee model. Lanier noted in an emailed statement to the newsrooms that he took a reduced fee on this case and maintained that the attorney general’s office needed the kind of firepower his team can bring against an opponent like Google. “The Texas AG office and its lawyers are good, but specialists are needed in a war like this. And it is a war,” Lanier wrote. “It would be irresponsible to pursue Google on behalf of Texans without bring[ing] the fullest resources you can.” A competitive, open process for awarding contracts can be a strong defense against accusations of favoritism, Goddard said. Unlike some other states, Texas does not require these contracts be put out to competitive bid. Florida, for example, has one of the most robust laws in the country for procuring outside counsel, requiring the attorney general to explain in writing why a contingent-fee contract is necessary. It also mandates most contracts be put out to competitive bid and caps contingent-fee payouts at $50 million. Texas has no such cap. It also has virtually no method for state lawmakers to truly supervise this kind of practice. State law mandates only that the attorney general notify the Legislature when his office awards a contingent-fee contract, and certify that no in-house lawyers or private attorneys at an hourly rate can handle the task. Paxton has done so in boilerplate two-page letters that all say outside attorneys are needed because of the “scope and enormity” of the cases. If lawmakers are concerned about these contracts, there is no mechanism for them to challenge Paxton’s determination that private counsel is needed. Having lawyers bid for work would eliminate the appearance of impropriety that hangs over Paxton’s hires, Goddard said. “A couple look like paybacks, which is extraordinarily improper, in other words to award a contract to someone who’s a major contributor or has recently left your office,” he said. “All of those would not be allowed in our state.” Officials in other states have said they can still secure big wins for their constituents without relying on private firms. California, for example, reached a $93 million settlement with Google in 2023 over claims that the company was clandestinely tracking users’ locations. A year earlier, in a case with similar allegations, Oregon and Nebraska led a 40-state coalition that won a $392 million settlement against the company. Texas was not part of this suit. The latter agreement required Google to make new privacy disclosures to consumers, restricted its ability to share users’ location information with advertisers and required the company to prepare an annual report detailing how it was complying with the settlement terms. Doug Peterson, the Republican attorney general of Nebraska at the time, said negotiating the financial penalty — Nebraska’s share was $11.9 million — was a secondary goal of the settlement. “The most important thing we’re trying to do is to stop the bad behavior,” Peterson said. McCarty, one of the attorney general employees who blew the whistle on Paxton, said private lawyers can be talented, but they have an incentive to fixate on the financial portion of settlements — which is tied to their compensation — rather than enforcement provisions that may best protect a state’s residents. “Government enforcers, especially in the antitrust context, can focus on more effective solutions,” McCarty said. Norton Rose Fulbright has yet to send its final billing records to the attorney general’s office but is likely to be rewarded handsomely. The firm helped the state secure a $1.38 billion settlement with Google in May. Google spokesperson José Castañeda said the Texas settlement, which has not been finalized, will contain no new restrictions on the company’s practices. Under the terms of its contracts, the firm’s fees could exceed $350 million.

Title: Goldman Sachs, BNY Bring $7 Trillion Money Market to Blockchain

The announcement comes just days after President Trump signed a law that introduces US-regulated stablecoins. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com For all the sci-fi promises about blockchain transforming finance, the reality will be more mundane as thousands of ordinary instruments quietly move to digital ledgers. On Wednesday, it was money market funds. Goldman Sachs and the Bank of New York (BNY) announced they’re allowing institutional investors to buy digitized tokens that mirror shares in the funds, making a $7 trillion industry in which liquidity is a key selling point even more liquid. Money market funds, if you’re new here, are a type of mutual fund that invests in things that are very liquid and very short-term. That means the most liquid thing of all, cash, as well as cash equivalents like commercial paper. When these funds invest in debt, it’s highly rated and comes with a short-term maturity, like US Treasurys or repo agreements. This makes them a relatively safe place to park cash in times of volatility, but the tradeoff for low risk and ability to quickly redeem your money is lower dividends when compared with more aggressive or longer-term investments. There has, of course, been no shortage of volatile times in recent years. The Federal Reserve hiking interest rates in 2022 and the investor games of inflation-watch and tariff-watch that have since followed drew some $2.5 trillion into money market funds, helping swell the industry to $7 trillion. Wall Street’s latest blockchain integration goes beyond simply digitizing traditional finance. The real innovation lies in creating digital tokens that mirror money market fund shares, a move that could fundamentally change how these instruments work: Several of the biggest funds in finance — BlackRock, Fidelity, Federated Hermes — have signed up to participate in the launch, with BNY and Goldman’s asset management units joining as well. Token Mention: The announcement comes just days after President Trump signed a law that introduces US-regulated stablecoins. Retail giants Walmart and Amazon, as well as Wall Street titans JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, have all signaled that they’re exploring the stablecoin space, which involves digital tokens typically pegged to the US dollar that can be used for transactions. The money market fund token, by contrast, pays a yield and acts as an investment; both cases are indicative of how blockchain is increasingly going to play a role in every aspect of finance. Block’s membership in the index comes as it transitions into an all-in-one finance platform that offers debit cards and loans to clients. The timing of Strategy’s latest Bitcoin gains was hardly a surprise: last week also marked “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill. Berlin-based economist Jan Philipp Fritsche explains how the new NATO defense spending pledge and US crypto legislation could impact the EU. Goldman’s top line metrics — profit up 22% to $3.7 billion and total revenues up 15% to $14.6 billion — also bested analysts’ expectations. In the past 30 days, Ethereum treasury companies scooped up more than 545,000 ether worth at least $1.6 billion, CoinTelegraph reported. The consensus takeaway from the earnings season so far is that the economy is, in spite of everything, doing pretty good. The new rules could let homebuyers keep their crypto and use it to qualify for loans though mainstream banks. The big US banks bested Q1 earnings expectations, and many observers expect big boosts to their Q2 trading desk revenues. Nothing to boost an asset class like the most powerful legislative body in the world holding a week in your honor. The dollar is the most important currency on earth, adding up to 57.7% of global currency reserves in the first quarter. The bank downgraded JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, citing a classic case of macroeconomic uncertainty. The TINA trade has hit some snags in recent years, with bonds looking like a pretty swell alternative in an era of high interest rates. © 2025 The Daily Upside

However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday — where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods — companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice — who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas” — moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand — like the demand represented by massive data centers — could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast — responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate — many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened — but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don't think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications and experts testifying in front of Congress, began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there's growth in electricity use and there's a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what is likely to happen,” Koomey says. Geoffrey Pounder | July 24th 2025, 06:19 am Headline: "Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" Make that: "Trump and the fossil-fuel industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" It's wrong, misleading, and unhelpful to conflate the energy industry with fossil fuels. As if they are one and the same. The energy industry increasingly includes renewables like solar and wind. Other energy sources include hydro, nuclear, biofuels, etc. The fossil-fuel industry routinely conflates the two. They are not synonymous. Let's help ourselves, not the fossil-fuel industry.

Tokenisation has been a buzzword among crypto enthusiasts for years, promising to transform financial markets by moving assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate onto the blockchain. While regulatory support is growing, progress has been slower than expected. (Source: Reuters) Under President Trump’s administration, new laws have relaxed regulations around crypto. This has opened doors for faster development of tokenised financial assets and increased investor interest in the sector. Tokenisation involves converting traditional financial assets into blockchain-based tokens. These tokens represent the original asset and can be stored in crypto wallets or traded on blockchain platforms, just like cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are tokenised versions of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. They’re pegged 1:1 with real assets and allow cross-border transfers outside traditional banking. While they face criticism for enabling illicit finance, they also serve populations with weak financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are booming, with the market worth around $256 billion and projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028. However, tokenised stocks, bonds, and other assets still lack scale and secondary market liquidity. Despite years of hype, tokenised assets face hurdles. Many banks are developing private blockchains that aren’t interoperable, limiting trading. Without public secondary markets, these tokens remain stuck in early-stage trials. Proponents say tokenisation improves liquidity for hard-to-trade assets like real estate and lowers entry barriers for retail investors. It could create fractional ownership opportunities and democratize access to complex asset classes. Major institutions like Bank of America, Citi, and BlackRock are exploring tokenisation. Coinbase is seeking approval to offer tokenised equities, signalling growing institutional confidence in this space. New U.S. laws such as the Clarity Act aim to provide a defined legal framework for stablecoins and other tokens. These rules are expected to boost adoption and reduce legal uncertainty around tokenised assets. Despite optimism, risks remain. Critics warn of potential systemic vulnerabilities, especially without audits and strong oversight. The ECB has flagged stablecoins as threats to financial stability, and regulators insist that tokenised securities must still comply with existing laws.

Title: Retail Investors Want In—Just As Private Equity Industry Resets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/07/24/retail-investors-want-in-just-as-private-equity-industry-resets/

ByCarrie McCabe ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Private Equity Retail investors are increasingly eager to access private equity (“PE”), drawn by the promise of higher returns and diversification. With public markets dominated by a narrow set of tech-driven mega-cap stocks, the appeal of uncorrelated, long-term private market exposure is growing. According to the American Investment Council’s 2025 public pension study, whose members consist of private equity and growth capital firms, private equity delivered a median annualized return of 13.5% over the 10-year period ending in 2024. It was also the best-performing asset class in public pension portfolios—outpacing public equity, real estate, and fixed income. To date, retail investors have had limited access to burgeoning private assets, an immense marketplace. Private assets, including PE, have tripled in size since 2013 and are projected to reach $65 trillion globally by 2034, according to Bain. And more than 1,500 global startups now carry unicorn valuations, as companies stay private longer. Retail interest is being reinforced by a shift in policy. Congress is weighing legislation to allow defined contribution retirement plans—including 401(k)s—to access private equity. A new executive order is expected to clarify fiduciary protections for plan sponsors, particularly around fees and valuation concerns. However, retail’s arrival comes just as the private equity model is undergoing a profound transition. For much of the past decade, PE thrived on cheap debt, rising valuations, and global dealmaking. That model is under pressure. “Performance levers that were pulled to such great effect during the low-rate era—principally financial leverage and valuation expansion—will lose potency,” notes Future Standard in their recent private markets outlook. Rather today, with borrowing costs higher and valuations compressed, managers must create value through margin expansion, pricing power, and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the macro backdrop isn’t helping. Current US policies have clouded the M&A environment, where valuation is often negatively correlated to volatility. And timely exits, which underpin PE’s return profile, are becoming harder to achieve. Distributions as a share of net asset value have fallen to just 11%—the lowest in over a decade. And PitchBook estimates there are over 12,000 U.S. PE-backed companies in inventory—enough to last seven or eight years at the current exit pace. Even elite investors are adjusting to this new PE environment. Yale University, long an advocate of PE, is reportedly seeking to sell up to $6 billion in private equity holdings to manage liquidity constraints. As institutional fundraising slows, Wall Street is turning to retail. BlackRock recently launched a target-date fund including private equity and credit, backed by $30 billion in acquisitions to expand its private markets platforms. Certainly, private equity remains a powerful investment engine, but it’s evolving. While institutional investors are equipped to navigate illiquidity, fees, and valuation opacity, the average retail investor may not be. Products reaching individual investors often lack the access or pricing advantages of large institutions. Layered fees—across platforms, managers, and structures—can severely dilute returns. In a lower-return environment, that friction matters more. Successful retail participation will depend on access via sophisticated fiduciary advisors—those bound to act in a client’s best interest and capable of navigating complexity. Policy may soon open the doors wider, but access is not the same as advantage. For retail investors, the PE opportunity is real—but so is the challenge to enter wisely.

ByIan Sayson ByIan Sayson, Forbes Staff. Aboitiz InfraCapital owns and operates the Mactan-Cebu International Airport. BlackRock will buy 40% of Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ privately held infrastructure unit, bolstering Aboitiz InfraCapital’s financial muscle as it steps up spending to modernize the country’s infrastructure. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s wholly owned unit, and Aboitiz Equity are in “the process of finalizing a strategic partnership,” the Philippine conglomerate said in a statement, without disclosing the amount of the potential sale. GIP, which was acquired by BlackRock in October, has over $183 billion in assets under management. It has interests in energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water utility and waste management sectors. “The Philippines has compelling growth prospects, which can be further enhanced by developing world-class infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of GIP, said. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to become a strategic partner of the Aboitiz Group.” The Philippine government aims to double infrastructure spending to at least 2 trillion pesos ($35 billion) by 2028 from 1 trillion this year as it accelerates projects such as the 33-kilometer Metro Manila subway that’s estimated to cost 489 billion pesos to build. Aboitiz Equity—the publicly traded holding company of tycoon Sabin Aboitiz and his family—has been scaling up its infrastructure investments in recent years. It has interests in airports, power plants, industrial estates, telecommunications towers and water utilities. Shares of Aboitiz Equity gained 2.3% in late afternoon trading in Manila. “We are honored to explore this opportunity with Global Infrastructure Partners,” Sabin Aboitiz, CEO and president of the conglomerate said. “Together, we aim to deliver projects that improve lives and empower communities.” Aboitiz InfraCapital swung to a 207 million loss in the first quarter even as sales jumped 53% to 2.4 billion pesos amid soaring finance charges on the company’s mounting debt levels. Its total borrowings almost tripled to 45.3 billion pesos as of end-2024 from a year ago. Aside from infrastructure, Aboitiz Equity has interests in banking, financial services, food manufacturing, and real estate. With an estimated net worth of $2.2 billion, the Aboitiz family is among the wealthiest in the Philippines.

Title: Goldman Sachs Partners With BNY Mellon To Bring $7 Trillion Money Market To Crypto

The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain. The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump, has made another big move into Ethereum. The group converted $13 million worth of USDC into 3,473 ETH, adding to its already large stash of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The move pushes the platform’s total Ethereum holdings to 73,616 ETH—worth about $275 million based on current prices. This latest transaction continues a buying trend that’s gained attention over the past few months. Data from Lookonchain shows that World Liberty Financial is sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $33 million. The project’s average entry price for Ethereum sits around $3,272. With ETH trading higher now, the bet appears to be paying off. Trump’s World Liberty(@worldlibertyfi) just spent 13M $USDC to buy 3,473 $ETH at $3,743 again! World Liberty has bought a total of 73,616 $ETH($275M) at an average price of $3,272, with an unrealized profit of $33M+.https://t.co/0qWkRUhTQb pic.twitter.com/WG1zpl3PJC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Last week, World Liberty also picked up over 3,000 ETH for $10 million. In May, they added another 1,580 ETH at a cost of $3.5 million. These steady acquisitions show a clear strategy: accumulate ETH and hold while prices climb. On the market side, Ethereum has responded with more green candles. The token rose 2% in the last 24 hours, hitting a daily high of $3,763. Over the past week, ETH is up 20%. Over the last month, it’s gained 65%. World Liberty Financial is not alone in taking a deep plunge into Ethereum. SharpLink and Bitmine have also boosted their ETH positions. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is said to be developing increasing interest in Ethereum, after establishing a strong presence in the Bitcoin arena. The momentum has also fueled the emergence of Ether Machine, a $1.6 billion Ethereum-specific effort. That effort is backed by the likes of Pantera Capital, Archetype, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Electric Capital. All these moves set the scenario for Ethereum to be a leading option among the major players, not merely independent traders. The surging interest is driving ETH into the mainstream limelight. While new investors are buying in, older Ethereum holders are also stirring. Some dormant wallets recently moved vast amounts of the altcoin. This type of movement is bound to attract notice. It’s not the money—it’s when. And with so many of the major players stepping in, even long-quiet holders may find this the time to do something. Ethereum isn’t merely riding a wave of price activity. Institutions, funds, and political parties are stockpiling it, quietly transforming it into something bigger than another crypto token.

Title: Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla so activist investors can’t boot him—but not so much the board can’t fire him if he goes ‘crazy’

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just confessed that he thinks his 13% ownership stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer leaves him vulnerable to activist shareholders who could move to oust him from the $1 trillion company. Still, he admitted he shouldn’t have so much control over Tesla that the board can’t fire him if he goes “crazy,” he said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It is a big deal—I don’t want to find I have so little control I can be easily ousted by activist shareholders,” Musk said. “That is a major concern to me as I’ve mentioned in the past and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.” I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024 Musk owns 13% of Tesla, a stake currently valued around $139 billion. He has previously stated he wants to own 25% of the electric vehicle manufacturer as it further expands into AI with unassisted Full Self Driving and robotics. Such a stake would be worth about $267.5 billion and would eclipse holdings by large institutional investors in Tesla such as Vanguard and Blackrock. Musk has worried in the past about the influence of activist investors or proxy advisory firms steering Tesla down the wrong long-term path at the expense of short-term pressures. However, Tesla currently maintains a defensive position against activists. Its bylaws call for what is termed a supermajority vote requirement, meaning shareholder votes must achieve support from two thirds of all outstanding shares (66.67%) rather than a simple 50% majority in order to pass. The board committed last year to Tesla shareholders that it would eliminate the supermajority vote requirement, but it hasn’t been able to muster enough investor participation. Tesla amended its bylaws in 2023 to provide shareholders with proxy access rights, meaning a shareholder or group of shareholders owning 3% or more of Tesla for at least three years can nominate directors to Tesla’s board. A stake that size would be valued at more than $20 billion. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require activist investors to disclose their stakes in company stock once they reach 5%, which is also the point where an activist can typically gain credibility with the board. A 5% stake in Tesla is worth more than $30 billion. In comparison, legendary activist investor Nelson Peltz took on the Walt Disney board after building a stake valued at about $3.5 billion at its peak. Activist investors often typically target small-cap publicly traded companies. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk shared his view on his ownership stake in response to an analyst’s question about how comfortable the CEO was in evolving Tesla in new directions with only the 13% stake. Musk pointed the annual shareholder meeting, which will be held November 6, as a potential issue to get aired out then. “I think that, as I’ve mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy,” he said. Musk has been working without a base salary or annual bonus for years, after the Tesla board granted him a moonshot pay package once valued as high as $56 billion—the highest for a publicly traded CEO. However, that pay package was twice rescinded by a judge and Tesla has announced it formed a board committee to hash out next steps. With the delay in Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the company has not yet published a proxy report to shareholders, which typically includes executive compensation disclosures. Tesla reported mixed results in its second quarter financials on Wednesday. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, its worst revenue performance in the past decade. Operating income dropped 42% year-over-year to under $1 billion, although Tesla was still profitable with $1.2 billion in GAAP net income. Meanwhile, free cash flow cratered 89% year-over-year to $146 million, compared to $1.3 billion during the same quarter last year. Deliveries were down 13% to 384,122, although there were some major developments noted. Tesla launched its much-ballyhooed Robotaxi pilot in Austin, and it boosted its AI training capacity. Separately, Tesla opened a new diner and drive-in theater at a mega charging station in Hollywood this week. Tesla executives did not address speculation about a Tesla investment in Musk’s xAI, nor did they address questions from retail investors about Musk’s involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla’s value. Retail investors post questions on an open platform for Tesla shareholders called Say in advance of the earnings releases. Many related to Musk had to do with his compensation and the board’s plan to oversee Musk’s future political moves. “Elon the person has freedom of speech,” wrote one shareholder representing 47,000 shares. “The brand ambassador of Tesla does not. What is the board doing to distance Tesla from the private actions of its CEO?” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Top stablecoin issuer Tether (USDT) is unveiling its investment branch’s portfolio, which includes over a hundred different companies in multiple sectors. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino says the investments were made with the company’s own profits and that he expects the portfolio to grow. “Today Tether publishes (a portion) of its investment/venture portfolio. Overall Tether group invested in more than 120+ companies and this number is expected to grow significantly in the next months and years.

When a company issues a token representing a real-world asset, such as a stock, but it doesn’t have any right to the underlying, “what you’re really doing is taking away from the integrity of investing and moving towards a gambling mindset,” he told Decrypt in a recent interview. “This is the meme-coin-ification of equities,” he added. In 2023, Kaplan testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had clearly laid out a path to compliance for crypto firms, provoking scrutiny from Republicans and crypto advocates who argued the status quo is unworkable. With tokenization gaining traction under a crypto-friendly SEC following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump, Prometheum is trying to reposition itself as a firm specializing in on-chain securities, reprising a familiar tune, but in a slightly different way. “It’s not really a pivot,” Kaplan said. “We've been working with issuers for a long time, and we're very excited for more and more products to come on-chain.” Through a panoply of licenses and subsidiaries, Kaplan said Prometheum can service the “entire lifecycle of a digital asset,” using its transfer agent, alternative trading system, and a special-purpose broker dealer, which also serves as a custodian. Kaplan said Prometheum can currently safeguard a handful of tokens but on-chain securities are coming next. From the beginning, Kaplan said that Prometheum’s goal has been to “to integrate blockchain technology into market infrastructure to just create a better apple cart,” following the same rules but “eliminating the drag that occurs from legacy systems.” The vision parallels BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who predicted tokenization would become the “next generation of markets” by making markets more efficient in 2022. Citadel Securities, one of the world’s largest market makers, urged the SEC in a letter earlier this week to treat tokenized equities in a similar manner to traditional counterparts. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘look-a-like’ securities is not innovation,” it argued, calling on the SEC to “resist self-serving requests for broad exemptions.” In a statement weeks ago, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce told firms structuring tokenized offerings to consider meeting with the regulator, noting that tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations. In recent months, crypto exchange Kraken has backed xStocks on Solana, while trading platform Robinhood has introduced “stocks tokens” on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum. Robinhood clarified, following criticism from OpenAI, that its tokens represent contracts, and in the case of the ChatGPT maker, they give “indirect exposure to public markets.” Earlier this month, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo argued to Decrypt that the only true form of tokenization is “native,” meaning the asset itself is issued on-chain, as opposed to representing an asset that’s held, managed, and recorded somewhere else. Kaplan agrees, but he thinks not all companies are getting the compliance element. “I think people have started to view tokenization as an alternative to regulation,” he said. “It might be a derivative, but it's a security, and therefore it still has to follow the rules.” CORRECTION (JULY 23, 2025, 4:40 p.m.): Fixes title in headline to Co-CEO.

Title: President Trump Plans to Open 401(k)s to Bitcoin, Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity: FT

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Oscar Zarraga Perez The executive order, expected this week, aims to unlock the $9 trillion retirement market by allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets. Financial Times reported today that President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets such as gold, private equity, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9tn US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, gold, and private equity in a move that would spur a radical shift in the way Americans’ savings are managed,” reported the Financial Times. According to Financial Times, the order is expected this week and will direct federal regulators to remove barriers preventing 401(k) plans from including these non-traditional investments in managed funds. This includes digital assets, metals, private loans, infrastructure deals, and corporate buyout funds. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future,” said the White House in a statement to the Financial Times. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Trump’s move builds on his administration’s earlier efforts to ease bitcoin and crypto regulations. In May, the Department of Labor reversed a rule that discouraged bitcoin and other crypto in retirement plans. Trump has also supported recent bitcoin and other crypto related bills passed by the House and credited the industry with helping him win the 2024 election. The executive order could benefit major private investment firms such as Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, reported the Financial Times, which have all pinned much of their future growth on investing money on behalf of retirement savers. “Blackstone has struck a partnership with Vanguard, while Apollo and Partners Group are among firms that will offer investments to Empower, a large 401k plan sponsor. BlackRock has already begun working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party manger of retirement savings plans,” stated Financial Times.
