Title: Friedrich Merz

No. 3 — Germany The reluctant radical Friedrich Merz is the man breaking Germany’s postwar taboos. For half a century, the now German chancellor personified his country’s conservative orthodoxy: a Christian Democrat devoted to balanced budgets and ready to trust Washington to keep the peace. Now, with war on the continent and Germany’s economy sputtering, Merz has rewritten the script: spending big, rearming fast and declaring that Berlin — and the rest of Europe — must be ready to stand on its own. His move last March to unleash hundreds of billions of euros in borrowing for infrastructure and defense marked one of the most radical breaks in modern German fiscal policy — and one of the fastest. With just two weeks left in the outgoing parliament, Merz rammed through a spending package that shredded decades of debt-averse orthodoxy. Just as dramatic has been his shift on foreign policy. Washington’s transformation from indispensable friend to unpredictable frenemy reportedly shook Merz, 70 — once described in these pages as Germany’s most American chancellor. His career includes a decade in the private sector, most noticeably with the U.S. asset manager BlackRock. That didn’t stop him, on the very day he won the chancellery, from declaring that Europe must “achieve independence from the USA.” Merz’s allies describe him as a risk-taker. And he hasn’t hesitated to push for ambitious economic reforms at home or to signal he’s ready to break with his country’s traditional tread-softly approach to Moscow by endorsing a plan to seize billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund a massive loan to Ukraine. His boldness, however, hasn’t translated into popularity. Six months in, the far-right Alternative for Germany overtook Merz’s conservatives in national polls for the first time since its creation. His grand coalition — a marriage of Christian Democrats and center-left Social Democrats — is feeling the heat, particularly on the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, high energy prices and growing competition from China are squeezing the industrial base that has long made Germany the envy of its neighbors. Meanwhile, Merz’s “autumn of reforms” — intended to reboot the economy — has become bogged down by political reality, with his slim parliamentary majority struggling to pass some of his more ambitious measures. Still, the chancellor’s position remains stronger than that of most of his peers. While France’s Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Keir Starmer wrestle with debt and fractious parliaments, Merz presides over a country with healthier finances. That gives him room to maneuver. He can afford to take a bit more time to, say, craft a sustainable pension reform that’s also politically plausible. While domestic troubles take up much of his bandwidth, Merz has begun flexing his muscles in Brussels — where Germany’s word still carries decisive weight. To the delight of Europe’s so-called frugal states, he has drawn clear red lines against the European Commission’s push to expand the EU’s long-term budget, casting himself as the guardian of fiscal and institutional discipline. That stance underscores Berlin’s growing influence in Europe’s power corridors. The German chancellor has become a central player in the EU’s debate over how far — and how fast — the bloc should move in integrating its defense, cutting its red tape and putting its fiscal house in order. But his ability to lead abroad depends on results at home: He can only credibly shape Europe’s future if he can restore confidence in Germany’s own economic engine — which sometimes means reining Brussels in as much as pushing it forward. “Friedrich Merz is realizing that he is needed as a foreign policy chancellor because Europe must strengthen its presence on the geopolitical stage,” said Sudha David-Wilp, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. “But he’s going to be measured by delivering domestically.” Merz’s staff picks leave little doubt about his intention to make his presence felt in Brussels — and to keep his foreign policy insulated from domestic turbulence. He has broken with German tradition by naming a fellow Christian Democrat, Johann Wadephul, as foreign minister — a portfolio usually handed to junior coalition partners. The choice is widely seen as a bid to reduce internal friction and ensure Berlin’s diplomacy runs directly through the chancellery. Merz has also installed his powerful chief of staff, Jacob Schrot, as head of a newly created National Security Council, tasked with coordinating Germany’s sprawling security apparatus and enforcing a single message on defense and foreign policy. Europe’s leaders are watching closely — and they know one thing for certain: There aren’t many other contenders for Europe’s next natural leader.

Title: Plume Secures ADGM Commercial License, Eyes Middle East RWA Expansion

Plume Network, a modular blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), has received a commercial license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Registration Authority, paving the way for expansion into the Middle East. The license allows Plume to scale RWA origination and distribution across the Middle East, Africa, and emerging markets, pending further approvals in ADGM, the UAE's premier international financial hub known for its progressive fintech and digital asset rules. This would help Plume, one of the leading blockchain by the number of RWA holders, establish a foothold in the region that's attracting global banks, fintech firms and asset managers, including BlackRock, Deutsche Bank and crypto firms like QCP. Abu Dhabi also hosts major sovereign wealth funds like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA, the world's largest with over $1 trillion AUM) and Mubadala Investment Company. “The UAE and the broader Middle East are rapidly becoming global leaders in the tokenization of real-world assets,” Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of Plume, said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. “The region’s progressive regulatory frameworks, institutional openness to digital finance, and ambition to diversify beyond traditional commodities make it an ideal environment for innovation. At Plume, we see the Middle East not just as a market, but as a strategic partner in shaping the future of compliant real-world tokenization," Yin added. The move builds on Plume's U.S. momentum, including a recent U.S. SEC transfer agent license for tokenized securities issuance and management. The latest ADGM approval is a general commercial license and does not authorize participation in regulated activities such as token issuance or custody. However, the firm is exploring partnership plans with local institutions and its own authorization for tokenization services. A permanent Abu Dhabi office is slated by year-end, with commercial announcements eyed for early 2026, alongside local hiring and ties to regional banks and fintechs. Plume's geographic focus spans the U.S., Asia, and Middle East, capitalizing on pro-RWA regimes in UAE's free zones like ADGM.

Title: Pick Your Financial Crash
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/12/09/pick-your-financial-crash/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T10:15:00Z
Full Content:
The stock market has made gains at rates that are several multiples more than the growth of the real economy for three years running. Investor euphoria is always a sign of danger ahead, but this time there are other special factors signaling a pending crash. And of course, they all interact. Once investors head for the exits, others start bailing. I. Deregulation of Increasing Risk. Trump’s bank regulators are systematically dismantling the safeguards that were put in place after the financial collapse of 2008. That crash was caused by opaque financial instruments such as credit derivatives that allowed almost infinite amounts of leverage. When they turned out to be worthless, the collapse was also nearly infinite. In the aftermath, Congress and the regulators limited the risks that banks could take. In classic Wall Street form, the wise guys responded by creating non-banks that could do most of what banks do. One “innovation” was private credit, a cool-kid word for shadow banking. Another was fintech, a cool-kid word for shadow banking with an app. These newly invented lenders are banks in everything but name, and thus evade nearly all transparency, supervision, or regulation. Absent regulation, these non-bank banks can engage in sky-high leverage, meaning that the ratio of lending to their own real capital can be unlimited and unexamined. More from Robert Kuttner In 2013, as part of the post-2008 reforms, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve put in place leverage limits for banks. Loans worth more than six times a company’s annual earnings were seen as too risky. That ruled out a lot of bank loans to fund private equity takeover targets, or loans to tech fantasies that had no earnings. Private credit stepped in to fund those projects that banks couldn’t take. Capital raised for lending to private equity–backed companies jumped more than a hundredfold to nearly $700 billion between 2006 and 2024, according to The Wall Street Journal. One thing that isn’t well understood is that private credit is propped up by traditional banks; Moody’s reported in October that banks have lent $300 billion to private credit firms. So if those firms go kablooey, it won’t stop short of the broader financial system, but cascade through the heart of Wall Street. Nevertheless, the banks complained to the regulators that they were losing business (to the very companies they were funding). Given what we know about the crashes of 2008 and 1929, the right policy would be to bring the upstarts under the regulatory umbrella. But instead, last Friday the agencies agreed to the bankers’ demands to help competition by deregulating the banks and getting rid of the 2013 leverage limits. Now, dealmakers can play banks off against private credit entities for the best (most risky) terms. And banks can go beyond funding non-banks and set up their own non-bank affiliates. When the inevitable crash comes, government will bail out the insiders, leaving regular people to suffer the aftermath. II. Crypto. The value of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride. Crypto plays no useful function in the economy except for pursuing illegal transactions and speculation in crypto itself. When crypto was the next new thing, and investors keep bidding up the market value of crypto coins, everyone looked like a financial genius. The whole market has been banking on self-enrichment by the Trump family and his key allies—like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who handed his crypto-friendly bank Cantor Fitzgerald to his son and has seen it enjoy its best year ever—leading to regulatory leniency and therefore freedom to make a fortune. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Congress, on the take from the crypto industry, added to the hype last July by enacting the GENIUS Act, which stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The act, written by the industry, pretends to provide prudent regulation, giving crypto a kind of federal blessing, but with no real protection for investors. But as the old Wall Street saying goes, genius is a rising market. And here again, leverage that works brilliantly on the upside becomes catastrophic when prices start falling. In recent weeks, Bitcoin, the marquee crypto product, has fallen from a peak value of just below $126,000 on October 7 to about $90,000 today. In just one week in November, the asset class lost $400 billion in value. This collapse has multiple knock-on effects on residual crypto plays. As Bloomberg recently reported, “An array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up Bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.” But once prices started falling, “The median stock price of US and Canadian-listed digital asset treasuries has fallen 43% this year, with some companies’ stocks falling over 99%.” When the crypto craze began, traditional financial companies were insulated from it. But Wall Street has tried to get in on the action by sponsoring crypto-backed funds, exposing blue-chip firms like BlackRock to risk. I recently got a pitch from a crypto company promoting the story of how an entrepreneur in Argentina shielded himself from exchange rate risk and inflation risk by loading up on Bitcoin. In fact, the entrepreneur could have gotten exactly the same benefits by buying dollars. Buying Bitcoins rather than dollars added the risk that the Bitcoins would lose value—which they have. What’s really happening, as it does in every Ponzi scheme, is that the wise guys, who profited handsomely by getting in early, need more rubes to keep buying the stuff in the hope that it will hold its value. As crypto becomes more interconnected with the rest of an unregulated financial system, the risk is that they will take each other down. III. Artificial Intelligence and Tech. Is the AI boom a bubble? Apologists for the massively inflated value of Nvidia and other digital stocks reliant on the growth of AI keep pointing out that unlike pure stock market bubbles, where inflated stock prices are based mainly on the hope of further price rises, AI is adding real value and Nvidia is earning real and massive profits. Maybe. On the other hand, a dangerously concentrated share of the stock market’s run-up, more than half, is in just seven companies, the so-called Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Of these, Tesla is already faltering. Another tech giant, OpenAI, had a disappointing rollout of the latest version of its marquee product, ChatGPT. The massive bet on AI may pay off in many respects. But any economy that is this highly concentrated is at risk. With inflation rising and the cost of capital increasing with it, the $3 trillion widely projected to be invested in AI in the coming years becomes more costly and risky. Meanwhile, China, which just rang up its first trillion-dollar annual trade surplus as of the end of November, is challenging the U.S. lead in AI. Plus, as the Prospect has reported in detail, the way the build-out of AI is being funded bears numerous resemblances to the housing bubble, with dicey loans, loads of hype, and circular financing. A loss of demand or simply someone calling in their loans could lead to a crash. I am not licensed to provide investment advice. It could be that the highly leveraged loans by private credit will pay off; that the value of crypto will rebound; and that AI will live up to its hype. The Red Sox could also win next year’s World Series. First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: Crypto ETFs diverge: Bitcoin suffers $60M outflows; ETH, SOL, XRP funds in green

The digital tokens space remains choppy ahead of the December 10 Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Crypto exchange-traded funds, which have become vital in gauging institutional appetite in these risk assets, confirm the current uncertainty. Interest around BTC ETFs remained negative yesterday, with the products recording net outflows amounting to $60.48 million (SoSoValue data). The significant withdrawals came as investors reacted to the weekend’s sluggish performance across the crypto landscape. Bitcoin failed to break $92,000 again, currently trading at $90,150. However, Monday was not gloomy for all BTC ETF issuers. BlackRock proved its resilience and dominance as its IBIT attracted $28.76 million in inflows. While funds like Graycale’s GBT (-44.03M) and Fidelity’s FBTC (-39.44M) saw substantial withdrawals on December 8, IBIT’s steadiness indicates that profit taking, not a shift in interest, likely triggered the mixed flows into Bitcoin. While Bitcoin bled on December 8, Ethereum exchange-traded funds turned positive with $35.5 million inflows. Notably, the funds recorded substantial exits in the previous two sessions, on December 4 (-41.5M) and December 5 (-75.2M). Indeed, Ethereum has been on the investor radar lately following its Fusaka upgrade, which targets enhanced speed, scalability, and lower costs for Ether-based Layer 2 platforms. Moreover, the inflows indicate that investors are viewing Ethereum as a legitimate token for portfolio diversification beyond Bitcoin. Indeed, the second-largest crypto by value is experiencing renewed interest from institutional participants. For example, BlackRock is seeking the SEC’s authorization for a new staked Ether trust ETF – the ETHB. The proposed product differs from BlackRock’s popular ETHA trust in that the staking Ether trust will track Ethereum’s performance and include incentives gained from the trust’s staked Ether. ETH is trading at $3,124 after gaining more than 10% the past seven days. Solana spot products closed the previous day with $1.2 million inflows. While the figure remains modest, it reflects consistent demand for SOL ETFs. Monday’s inflows have extended their winning streak to three days, demonstrating appetite for these products despite broader turmoil. Solana exchange-traded funds have attracted roughly $639 million since their late October debut. Meanwhile, SOL price is hovering at $133, down 2% the past 24 hours. Ripple’s crypto asset stood out on December 8, with a net inflow of $38.04 million, eclipsing peers for the day. Grayscale led as its GXRP drew over $810K in fresh capital on Monday. Also, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin’s XRP exchange-traded funds recorded notable daily gains. Regulatory clarity and XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions have elevated the altcoin’s appeal among institutional investors. Nevertheless, the December 8 ETF performance sends a clear message. Investors are now diversifying into other cryptos beyond Bitcoin. Altcoin ETFs are gaining traction for their added advantages, as the crypto industry gains increased acceptance in mainstream finance.

Title: All Eyes On Ethereum: Price Attempts Key Breakout As BlackRock Files For Staked ETH ETF

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After weeks of speculation, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially filed for a staked Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid the bullish news, the King of Altcoins’ price is attempting to break out of a two-month resistance, which could set the stage for a retest of higher levels. BlackRock has submitted an S-1 form with the US SEC to get approval for its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), which “seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of ether and rewards from staking a portion of the Trust’s ether, to the extent the Sponsor in its sole discretion determines that the Trust may do so without incurring undue legal or regulatory risk.” Filed on December 5, BlackRock’s registration statement explains that, if approved, the proposed fund aims to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings, distributing staking rewards to stakeholders at least quarterly. Coinbase Custody Trust will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s ETH holdings, the filing noted, while Anchorage Digital Bank will be an available alternative custodian for the Trust’s ether holdings. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the custodian for the Trust’s cash holdings and the administrator of the Trust. Notably, BlackRock’s ETHB will operate separately from its spot ETH fund, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which is the largest in its category with $11 billion in assets under management (AUM). It’s worth noting that the crypto community began speculating about BlackRock’s upcoming staked ETH fund after the leading asset manager registered the name in Delaware last month. In a November report, 10x Research argued that the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock would bring “increased scrutiny” to “the economics of DATs” as retail investors would reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. The report added that many investors are unaware that Digital Asset Treasury (DATs)’s embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. Ethereum’s price started the week attempting to reclaim a crucial area after managing to hold the $3,000 level as support despite the volatility during the weekend. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 3% in the daily timeframe, hitting $3,180 before retracing on Monday. Amid this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that “it’s time to pay attention to ETH,” noting that it nears a key level that could push the price to higher zones. Per the chart, Ethereum briefly broke out of its two-month downtrend line, which has served as resistance since early October. Over this period, the King of Altcoins has attempted to break out of this level twice, but has ultimately been rejected during each attempt. On Monday morning, ETH briefly broke above the trendline before being rejected a third time. However, if Ethereum reclaims the $3,120-$3,130 levels and turns the downtrend into support, it could build the base for a retest of the $3,200-$3,300 horizontal levels, which marks the lower boundary of its Q3 and early Q4 price range. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that Ethereum Dominance (ETHDOM) continues to move within its macro consolidation range, holding support at the 11.67% level. He previously affirmed that if “ETHDOM can maintain itself above 10.05% then it should be positioned for higher market dominance levels over time.” The analyst added that although history suggests a potential 2.5% drop to the consolidation range lows, this dip would occur “in the context of a macro move to 18%-20%” in the future. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,114, a 13.7% increase on the weekly timeframe. Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Bitcoin Active Addresses Slide As ETF Era Rewires Market Participation — Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has shown a sharp slowdown since spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched. While institutional inflows into these products have accelerated, the number of active BTC addresses has declined. As Wall Street embraces BTC exposure, the network’s grassroots participation appears to be undergoing a significant transformation. In an X post, the CEO of SwanDesk, financial analyst Jacob King, pointed out that Bitcoin active addresses have been in a steady decline since the US spot BTC ETFs launched in January 2024, and the irony is obvious. For years, BTC maximalists have pushed for Wall Street adoption, believing institutional involvement would unlock the next wave of mass usage. Instead, on-chain participation has dropped sharply as retail lost interest. King noted that these Bitcoiners have piled into the ETF for a quick, early FOMO bump, and then bailed, leaving behind a market where the asset is increasingly traded by proxy. According to King, ETF investing kills BTC’s core principles. While investors no longer hold or control their own assets as banks do, which is the very system BTC was designed to challenge, greed always beats ideology. Market watcher Crypto Seth has revealed that the net inflows into BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot BTC ETFs have been relatively subdued since October 10, when the largest liquidation events happened. Seth believes that this might turn into a momentum reversal soon, as the US stock market is at 1% below new highs despite retail sentiment remaining stuck in extreme fear. Seth also pointed out that the macro backdrop is shifting in BTC’s favor. This is because the Federal Reserve ended its Quantitative Tightening (QT) program on December 1, 2025, wrapping up a multi-year effort that shaved nearly $3 trillion from the balance sheet since 2022. Since the US Fed rate is still at 4.00%, more interest rate cuts are on the horizon, which is higher than both Europe and China. The BlackRock iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which was launched in January 2024, is currently the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on annual fee revenue, despite being less than two years old. Bitcoin is seeing key initiatives that improve its ecosystem. Every market cycle that has promise to unlock Bitcoin for decentralized finance (DeFi), RioSwap is one of the few products built on infrastructure that was capable of unlocking it in a truly decentralized way. According to Mintlayer, this was powered by Mintlayer’s native HTLC architecture, as RioSwap introduces a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that allows BTC to move directly into decentralized markets without wrapping, unbridging, and is fully in the user’s control. With the RioSwap testnet now live, Mintlayer sees this as the start of a new liquidity phase for BTC where the asset will become an active participant in the decentralized market on its own terms.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Tether deepens AI bet, backs Italian firm’s humanoid robots

The funding will support the development of humanoid robots for industrial use, aiming for “industrial scale performance.” Stablecoin giant Tether has announced it is one of the backers of an $81 million funding round for an Italian artificial intelligence startup aiming to build advanced humanoid robots. The 70 million euro funding round for startup Generative Bionics was led by the AI fund of CDP Venture Capital, with participation from Tether, AMD Ventures, Duferco, Eni Next and RoboIT. In an announcement on Monday, Tether said it provided capital to support the development of advanced humanoid robots, “built for industrial scale performance” and “human-centric interaction.” “Tether’s investment will support the development of Physical AI systems and edge AI solutions, and accelerate the industrial validation of the company’s humanoid platform, the development of its first production facility, and its integration in the broader robotics ecosystem,” Tether said. Generative Bionics is an AI startup and research spinoff from the Italian Institute of Technology. Its focus is on building humanoid robots with “real-world physical AI capabilities” such as industrial usability in factory production lines. “Tether’s support for Generative Bionics builds on its broader strategy to back emerging technologies that expand human potential while reducing reliance on centralized systems overseen by Big Tech,” Tether said. Related: Tether's USDt awarded key regulatory status in Abu Dhabi According to Tether, the firm focuses on five areas of investment. These include: finance, power, data, education and evolution, with AI investments such as these falling under the category of evolution. With a healthy balance sheet in 2025, the firm has made a series of investments across multiple sectors. In terms of AI, it was reported in mid-November that the firm was considering a hefty $1.15 billion investment in German AI robotics startup Neura. In the announcement, Tether also highlighted some other AI plays it has supported. “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development,” Tether said.

(Bloomberg) -- Nomura Asset Management Co. plans to relocate dozens of staff from its Tokyo headquarters to offices in cities such as London and New York to develop its homegrown talent for investment and sales operations. More staff with overseas business experience will boost Nomura’s stance as a global competitor in asset management, President Hiroyasu Koike said in an interview. “Unless we enhance our global investment capabilities, we will lose our reason for being,” he said, adding that he’s still considering specific locations for the staff. “We want to proactively send trainees and transfer staff to greatly strengthen the development of global talent.” Japan’s main finance regulator this year revealed how many domestic asset managers often lag behind overseas rivals due to a narrower product offering that is harming the country’s competitiveness as one of the world’s key financial centers. Reform of tax-free accounts under the Nippon Individual Savings Account scheme is helping to draw more people into investing in a nation traditionally more focused on lower-return savings. Nomura Asset Management currently has about 30 employees stationed abroad and Koike said he intends to significantly boost that figure, without specifying more detail. Potential destinations include existing offices in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other destinations where parent Nomura Holdings Inc. recently acquired some public asset management businesses from Macquarie Group Ltd. in the US and Europe. As of the end of September, Nomura Asset Management oversaw around ¥99.7 trillion ($643 billion). That’s still a sliver compared to global giants like BlackRock Inc., which managed $11.6 trillion as of December 2024. Koike said Nomura’s purchase of the Macquarie assets offers “a chance to grow into a transformed asset management company in five or ten years.” It’s also being considered as a destination for trainee assignments. Previously, Nomura had sent four trainees to American Century Investments, a major US asset manager in which it holds a stake. “I want to acclimatize staff to an environment where they conduct daily business operations in English,” Koike said. “Then, when they return to Japan, it would be ideal if they can leverage that network and what they’ve learned to become future talent capable of engaging in global operations and global management.” --With assistance from Russell Ward.

Title: Robinhood launches staking for Ethereum and Solana in ongoing crypto expansion
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/08/robinhood-launches-staking-for-ethereum-and-solana-in-ongoing-crypto-expansion/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T22:09:46Z
Full Content:
Robinhood is doubling down on crypto offerings. The trading app will launch staking for Ethereum and Solana in New York starting on Tuesday, according to the company, allowing customers to earn yield on cryptocurrency. The company will let customers stake in New York and plans to expand across the country. “We’re proud of the momentum we’ve seen with staking and especially excited that staking is now available to customers in New York, which has one of the most rigorous regulatory frameworks in the country,” wrote Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, in a note to Fortune. Staking has been part of the crypto universe for nearly a decade, rewarding users who lock up a stash of tokens in order to help operate a blockchain network. But uncertainty over its legal status has meant it has been mostly experienced crypto users who have engaged in it using their own wallets. In 2023, the exchange Kraken agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations that it broke the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules by offering staking. Robinhood’s launching of crypto stakes reflects a looser regulatory environment under President Donald Trump’s administration. “These crypto enhancements are strategic chess moves positioning Robinhood for the anticipated transformation of financial infrastructure through blockchain technology and tokenization—particularly with the regulatory clarity we expect under the current administration,” said Caydee Blankenship, senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research. Robinhood also announced a push into global crypto markets. In Europe, it will add perpetual futures contracts on several coins, and it will also enter the Indonesian market, as it agreed to buy a brokerage and crypto platform in the country. Robinhood is not new to crypto, as users on the platform have been able to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2018. However, the company has beefed up its crypto arm this year. In June, Robinhood completed a $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, the world’s longest-running crypto exchange. Crypto transactions accounted for more than 21% of the company’s revenue, as of last month’s earnings report. Robinhood’s expansion of its digital assets could help it challenge other crypto exchanges, according to Romeo Alvarez, research analyst at William O’Neil. “Robinhood is stepping up its efforts to compete on a global basis with larger trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Kraken,” he said. The past few days have seen other big banks vie for staking. On Friday, BlackRock filed for a stake Ethereum ETF, the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB). The Wall Street giant already has an Ethereum ETF (ETHA), but that one does not have staking components.

Title: Crypto, TradFi sentiment improves: Will Bitcoin traders clear shorts above $93K?

Improving retail crypto and TradFi investor sentiment align with a recent uptick in Bitcoin price, but sell orders and short positions in the $93,000 range threaten to cap the rally. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin price repeatedly revisited the $90,000 range as retail investor sentiment improved, fund managers restated their bullish expectations for a potential end-of-year rally, and Strategy announced a sizable (BTC) purchase. According to VanEck head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Bernstein wrote that “the Bitcoin cycle has broken the 4-year pattern (cycle peaking every 4 years) and is now in an elongated bull-cycle with more sticky institutional buying offsetting any retail panic selling.” Bernstein’s comments follow BlackRock chair and CEO Larry Fink mentioning that sovereign wealth funds are “incrementally” buying Bitcoin as it “has fallen from its $126,000 peak.” Fink said, Mirroring Fink’s and Bernstein’s view, on Monday, Strategy announced a fresh 10,624 BTC ($962.7 million) purchase at an average $90,615 per coin. Bitwise European head of research Andre Dragosch noted that Strategy’s purchase “was the biggest amount since July 2025.” While Bitcoin’s recovery from its Nov. 21 low of $80,612 has followed the improvement in investor sentiment, the price is still capped in the $90,000 to $93,000 range. On Saturday, chartered market technician Aksel Kibar said, Related: Did BTC's Santa rally start at $89K? 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week Cumulative volume data from Hyblock provides a more nuanced view, highlighting rising participation from investors in the 0 to 100 BTC trade cohort, which some analysts label as retail.

Similarly, order book data for BTC/USDT (perpetual contracts at Binance) shows a wall of asks starting at $90,000 and thickening from $94,000 to $95,000. Liquidation heatmap data, on the other hand, shows short liquidity at $94,000 to $95,300, which could serve as fuel for bulls to attempt a run on $100,000 if the market provides sufficient catalysts to induce an uptick in either spot or futures buying.

Title: ‘Justice was done,’ says Willow Park abuse survivor after ex-teacher Peter Kelly jailed for 10 years
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/12/08/justice-was-done-says-willow-park-abuse-survivor-after-ex-teacher-peter-kelly-jailed-for-10-years/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T21:36:41Z
Full Content:
“The process was brutal but justice was done,” said one man who was abused as a child by teacher Peter Kelly at Willow Park primary school in Dublin’s Blackrock. Kelly (73) was sentenced to a total of 10 years imprisonment at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Monday for the sexual abuse of eight boys at the school in the early to mid-1980s. The trial took place in camera but a number Kelly’s abuse survivors spoke to The Irish Times afterwards. Some did not want their names used. Matthew (not his real name), first made allegations about Kelly 25 years ago, in 2000, to the Willow Park school authorities. This led to Kelly’s resignation in 2004. “They fought me and fought me and fought me and fought me. I’m the original complainant,” he said. “If they had afforded me 1 per cent of the protection that they had afforded him, this would have come out many years ago,” he said. A Garda file on Matthew’s allegations against Kelly was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) who decided not to prosecute Kelly. “I left the country. I took that as not being believed,” he said. Kelly was sentenced to five years jail on Monday arising from the allegations made by Matthew. In his victim-impact statement to the court on December 2nd, Matthew recalled how, in order to escape abuse by Kelly at Willow Park, he steered his bicycle into a lamp-post. “At 11 years of age I never stood a chance,” he told the court. “I hated everything to do with school.” These days he is “putting one foot in front of the other. I’m not coping, I’m here,” he told The Irish Times. Aidan Moore, who agreed to be named, felt 10 years was “a fair sentence” for Kelly. “I can’t say I’m happy, because it’s not a happy day but Justice [Elma] Sheahan has given a fair sentence in regard to what the charges were and I am very comfortable with what the sentence is,” he said. Mr Moore has spent most of his life abroad, mainly because of his abuse at Willow Park. “I really feel that I can’t stay here. I spent a number of years in the United States and spent over 20 years in Africa, in Kenya. I’m back here for family reasons but I’m really struggling,” he said. Five of the eight men who made complaints against Kelly also alleged abuse by former Christian Brother Edward Baylor, now deceased. He was referred to by Justice Elma Sheahan in her sentencing judgement as “EB”. He was convicted of child abuse in 1988. Mr Moore said he had been abused by Baylor. “It is clear that the Holy Ghost Fathers/Spiritans enabled, protected and covered up for their abusers. That is one of the reasons why it has taken so long to get to where we are today, the conviction of one paedophile for 28 charges out of the thousands of crimes committed.” It also “required a lot of courage from the victims and their families, and an enormous amount of work by An Garda Síochána and the DPP has gone into achieving this result,” he said. Kieran Freeney said of the case he was “happy that it’s concluded and that we can all move on from this because it’s been over 30 years in the making”. When his mother died by suicide, and with his father living abroad for work reasons, Kieran became a boarder at Willow Park, where he was abused by both Kelly and Baylor at the ages of 11 and 12. Kelly was “the only one that’s alive so, unfortunately for him perhaps, but fortunately for us that we get some closure in our lives and some part of justice being served on behalf of myself and of my colleagues here today and all victims of Blackrock and Willow Park,” he said. For Luke (not his real name), Kelly’s sentence was “in line with what I was hoping for. I think that’s fair.” His own decision to come forward with his allegations followed the RTÉ Radio 1 documentary Blackrock Boys in 2022. “I was living in Germany at the time and I came forward. My brother, who is 12 years older than me, was also abused in the school. He has come forward.” As with many survivors, he had high praise for the gardaí involved who did “a fantastic job, especially Rachel Kilpatrick, Aisling Healy and the team”. Overall “the process was brutal but justice was done. It’s OK for people to come forward. There is help out there and the police have a very much victim-led approach. So I urge people to come forward. It’s better out than in,” he said.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher has been jailed for 10 years for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He had pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests. Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Sentencing Kelly today, Judge Elma Sheahan said she was struck by the bravery of these men who she said “bared their souls” and noted the “eloquent expression of their very real hurt and torment”. She said the injuries suffered included psychiatric issues, addiction and also the inter-generational hurt in the sense that the children and partners of these men have suffered too. Judge Sheahan said the men had waited for decades for their stories to be heard and believed and referred to the fact that during their childhood and adolescence, many could not explain their reasons for withdrawing from their families, their inability to attend school and their various addictions. She said that the worry and upset caused to those close to the victims is more evidence of the damage done by Kelly. Judge Sheahan noted that many of the victims had already suffered very real or significant trauma including the loss or death of parents before she added that a number of the victims had previously been sexually abused by another teacher at the school. She said as such, these victims were “already vulnerable children”. The judge took into account “the gruelling nature” of the trial for the victims while accepting that Kelly was entitled to “call on the State to prove the case against him”. Judge Sheahan said the aggravating features of the case were the seriousness of the offending, the position of the accused in the lives of the victims, the breach of trust, the age disparity, the repetitive nature of the offending, the number of complainants, the vulnerability of the victims both due to their age and their own personal circumstances as well as the fact that some of the abuse took place in front of their peers. Judge Sheahan said that in mitigation she accepted that Kelly has no previous convictions and is a frail man with many medical conditions, noting that Kelly requires ongoing oncology appointments for treatment for prostate cancer. She said he has lost the single greatest mitigation of a plea of guilty before acknowledging that he does not accept the verdict of the jury. She set various different sentences for each of the offences in relation to each of the victims, ranging from 20 months to five years, before she imposed a global consecutive sentence of 10 years. Judge Sheahan said “given the lack of acceptance on the part of the accused of the verdict, the court does not feel there is any evidential basis on which to suspend any of the sentence”. “I hope this brings some closure to the victims,” Judge Sheahan said. Earlier, Judge Sheahan was advised that two members of the jury panel were present in the courtroom for the sentence hearing. She said given that the case was to be heard in camera and not open to the public, those members of the jury should not be in court. “The court is always careful to be very thankful to the members of the jury for the work they have done and what they have sat through – the letter of the law would require that strictly speaking as they are no longer members of the jury they should not be in court,” Judge Sheahan said, adding “this is in no way to disregard the work they had done”. At an earlier sentence hearing last week, Judge Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Advertisement Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of times in their lives when they have struggled with thoughts of suicide. They spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made to “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Inspector Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told Judge Sheahan that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Mr Sexton told the court. Judge Sheahan said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Title: BlackRock Seeks SEC Nod To Launch Staked Ethereum ETF

Time Published: 2025-12-08T20:32:44Z
Full Content:
In a bold push into on-chain yield exposure, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially applied to list and trade shares of an investment vehicle tied to a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday for its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to investors. The S-1 is part of the SEC’s process for issuers to introduce investment vehicles like ETFs, but does not guarantee approval, and the fund’s listing exchange must still file a separate 19b-4 form. The filing comes a couple of weeks after BlackRock filed a name registration with the state of Delaware for the staking Ethereum trust ETF, signaling intent to file with the SEC soon. Unlike BlackRock’s popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF, which the company intends to list and trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker ETHB, will track the performance of Ether and add rewards earned from the trust’s staked ETH. “The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the S-1 reads. BlackRock had previously sought the SEC’s sign-off to add a staking component to ETHA. Though the Commission had acknowledged applications as early as July, it continued to delay a formal decision. Notably, Grayscale Investments has already added a staking functionality to its previously greenlighted spot ETH and mini ETH trusts following the approval of new generic listing standards for commodity trusts, as the SEC’s stance has shifted under new Chairman Paul Atkins. However, BlackRock has decided to launch a completely new fund while others modify their existing vehicles. ETHA remains the largest of its kind with around $16 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile, BlackRock manages the world’s largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT).

Unlike the firm’s popular iShares Ethereum Trust spot ETF (ETHA), the staking Ethereum trust ETF will track the performance of Ethereum and add rewards earned from the trust’s staked ETH. “The trust is a passive investment vehicle that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of Ethereum and staking some portion of the Ethereum it holds (which may vary from time to time),” the filing reads. The firm’s S-1 registration filing follows the November formation of the Delaware statutory trust, an act that typically precedes the ETF filing for crypto and commodity products. Previously, BlackRock had sought approval to add a staking component to its spot Ethereum ETF, ETHA. While the SEC had acknowledged requests as early as July, it continued to push back a formal decision, last delaying a decision in early September. It’s unclear how ETHB’s filing will affect any plans for staking additions to ETHA. A representative for BlackRock told Decrypt the firm could not comment on its ETHB ETF filing at present time. Ethereum staking ETFs hit the market following the creation of generic listing standards for commodity trusts. Grayscale’s ETHE was first to market in early October, followed by the REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF. But so far, they haven’t eaten into the success of BlackRock’s existing spot ETF. ETHA has more than $11 billion in funds under management, or around 3.6 million ETH, compared to less than $5 billion (or 1.8 million ETH) for Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH Mini Trust ETFs combined. BlackRock’s ETF success is also apparent in the Bitcoin market, highlighted by its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which is the largest crypto ETF on the market with around $70 billion in assets under management. IBIT is up around 1% on Monday as Bitcoin has fallen 1% in the last 24 hours to trade at $90,390. ETHA has jumped more than 3% as Ethereum is roughly flat, changing hands at $3,122. When approved, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHB) is expected to trade alongside BlackRock’s other ETFs on the Nasdaq exchange.

Title: IBM To Buy Confluent For $9.3 Billion To Expand AI Services
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/ibm-to-buy-confluent-for-93-billion-to-expand-ai-services
Time Published: 2025-12-08T17:25:10Z
Full Content:
International Business Machines Corp. is buying the data-streaming platform Confluent Inc. for about $9.3 billion, marking one of its largest takeovers yet and a major bet on the kind of enterprise software that artificial intelligence tools need to perform tasks in real time. IBM will pay $31 a share, according to a statement issued Monday. The enterprise value, which includes debt, is $11 billion, it said. The companies expect the deal to close by the middle of 2026. If the transaction fails or is terminated, IBM will pay Confluent a breakup fee of $453.6 million, according to an accompanying regulatory filing. The acquisition “could significantly improve IBM’s AI portfolio, and subsequently its software unit’s sales growth,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard wrote Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported the deal talks. Confluent shares rose as much as 29% to $29.86 after markets opened in New York, more than a dollar below the offer price. IBM shares rose as much as 2.4%. The AI boom has touched off billions of dollars in deals for businesses that build, train or leverage the technology, propelling the value of an entire ecosystem of data center developers, software makers, generative AI tool developers and data management firms. Mountain View, California-based Confluent sits in the data corner of that world, providing a platform for companies to gather — or “stream” — and analyze data in real time as opposed to shipping data in clunkier batches. Manufacturers such as Michelin, for example, have used Confluent’s platform to optimize their inventories of raw and semi-finished materials live. Instacart adopted Confluent to develop real-time fraud detection systems and gain more visibility into the availability of products sold on its grocery delivery platform. Businesses are increasingly tapping AI systems that manage tasks like this in real-time and require live flows of data to do so. IBM, which pioneered mainframe computers, has been trying to reposition its business around AI over the past few years. Under Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, it’s been buying software companies and selling generative AI-related services to enterprise clients. Software now makes up almost half its total revenue and continues to grow at a steady rate. The Confluent acquisition would be IBM’s biggest since it bought cloud software firm Red Hat for about $34 billion in 2019. Confluent’s takeover stands apart from the multibillion-dollar deals that have dominated the AI space in recent months, largely focused on data centers and the computing power necessary to build and power AI systems themselves. Soaring demand for such capacity has fueled massive transactions, including BlackRock Inc.’s $40 billion purchase of Aligned Data Centers and Oracle Corp.’s agreement to supply OpenAI with about 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, worth as much as $300 billion. Confluent was started in 2014 by a trio of founders who came from LinkedIn, including the company’s current chief executive officer, Jay Kreps. The firm’s shares had fallen 17% this year before news of the deal. The stock is far below its intraday peak of $94.97 a share in November 2021, following the company’s initial public offering. Barclays Plc, Centerview Partners LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised IBM, while Morgan Stanley advised Confluent, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the matter is private. The banks each declined to comment. The acquisition builds on a five-year partnership between the two firms, which allowed some IBM customers to use Confluent’s data-streaming platform. IBM completed its $6.4 billion purchase of HashiCorp Inc. in February and recently considered buying Informatica Inc., another infrastructure-focused vendor that was ultimately acquired by Salesforce Inc.

Title: Survivors of abuser Kelly tell of 'unimaginable trauma'

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent Most of those abused by Peter Kelly as young boys were in court to see him jailed. They stood in silence watching as he was led by prison officers back to the cells in the Criminal Courts. Many broke down afterwards, hugging friends and family members. The former maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock, a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin, was jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Kieran Freeney, whose mother had died shortly before the abuse began said afterwards that he was happy with the sentence as it would give him closure in his lifetime. He said two other predators who had abused children in Willow Park school were now deceased. And he said he was relieved for the other men present in court as well as all victims alive and dead. He said his message to them was that "we got one, and we managed to put him away". Mr Freeney said Kelly should be serving life, but he knew that at his age, ten years would be horrific. He said he hoped he would use his time to reflect on the lives he had damaged. Aidan Moore was seriously abused by another teacher at the school, Edward Baylor, who is now dead. Judge Elma Sheahan said he and a number of other boys, who had also been abused by Baylor, had suffered "unimaginable trauma". Speaking outside court, Mr Moore said today was a victory for all victims of sexual abuse crimes. But he said the fact that the Spiritan order had protected abusers was one of the reasons it had taken so long to get to this point which he said was the conviction of just one paedophile for 28 charges. However, Mr Moore said this victory was not taken lightly and required a lot of courage from victims as well as enormous work by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Moore said he wanted to speak to all victims of sexual abuse especially those struggling. He said he wanted them to know they were not alone. "It is not your shame and it is not your guilt," he said, adding "and you do not have to carry it alone". Mr Moore praised the "incredible courage" of brothers, David and Mark Ryan and their friend Maura Harmon, who revealed the abuse that had been happening in Willow Park and Blackrock College in their groundbreaking documentary "Blackrock Boys", broadcast on RTÉ Radio one in November 2022. He said many men had come forward to tell their stories since. He said others remained silent, and perhaps thought nothing would happen if they spoke up. However, he said today something had been achieved, and a paedophile was "where he belongs, behind bars". Mr Moore said even though these offences happened almost 50 years ago, paedophiles had not gone away. And he believed it was incumbent on every adult to look out for the welfare of children and be proactive in protecting innocent young lives from predatory paedophiles. He said it remained very much a live issue. He said he was standing in front of the courts because if it made a difference in even one person’s life, it would be worth it Mr Moore said the end of the trial and the sentencing was a huge relief and he had not expected the sentence to be as long as it was. He said it had been a very painful process to go through for all victims. He said he hoped other people would come forward so the extent of the abuse at the two schools would be known. Mr Moore also criticised the length of time being taken by the Spiritan order to set up a redress scheme. He said he had gone through an extremely painful settlement process and hoped other people would be able to avoid this. Mr Moore said he would never get over this. He said the effect of child sexual abuse was evident every day. He said it affected his wife, children and everyone who knew him. Spiritan Province 'deeply sorry' for harm In a statement this afternoon, the Spiritan Province said it was "deeply sorry" for the harm caused by Peter Kelly while he was a teacher at Willow Park School. The statement said their thoughts were with those who were abused as children by Kelly, and with their loved ones. And they said they hoped the court's verdict and the sentence passed today brought them some measure of validation and justice. The Spiritans said they offered them the same sincere apology that they extended to all who suffered abuse in their schools. The order said it had begun a Restorative Justice process for victims and survivors, and encouraged anyone affected to come forward. It said support was available through the Restore Together Group, the Restorative Justice Team and its services, and the Spiritan Safeguarding Office. Those affected have strongly criticised the amount of time taken by the order to put in place a redress scheme for them. In an earlier statement issued in October, the Spiritan Province said they acknowledged the deep pain and frustration suffered by victims and survivors and also acknowledged progress had not been as fast as anyone would wish. It outlined steps being taken to sell properties in order to make resources available for redress payments. Victim impact statements Last week the court heard victim impact statements from a number of the men. The first man to give his statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he did not want Kelly near him, but he could not get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do to make sure Kelly would not notice him so he would not touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he would not have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse had not happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it could not just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. Aidan Moore told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by Edward Baylor. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. He broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Others also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Judge Sheahan said she hoped today’s sentencing would bring them closure. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent Most of those abused by Peter Kelly as young boys were in court to see him jailed. They stood in silence watching as he was led by prison officers back to the cells in the Criminal Courts. Many broke down afterwards, hugging friends and family members. The former maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock, a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin, was jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Kieran Freeney, whose mother had died shortly before the abuse began said afterwards that he was happy with the sentence as it would give him closure in his lifetime. He said two other predators who had abused children in Willow Park school were now deceased. And he said he was relieved for the other men present in court as well as all victims alive and dead. He said his message to them was that "we got one, and we managed to put him away". Mr Freeney said Kelly should be serving life, but he knew that at his age, ten years would be horrific. He said he hoped he would use his time to reflect on the lives he had damaged. Aidan Moore was seriously abused by another teacher at the school, Edward Baylor, who is now dead. Judge Elma Sheahan said he and a number of other boys, who had also been abused by Baylor, had suffered "unimaginable trauma". Speaking outside court, Mr Moore said today was a victory for all victims of sexual abuse crimes. But he said the fact that the Spiritan order had protected abusers was one of the reasons it had taken so long to get to this point which he said was the conviction of just one paedophile for 28 charges. However, Mr Moore said this victory was not taken lightly and required a lot of courage from victims as well as enormous work by An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Moore said he wanted to speak to all victims of sexual abuse especially those struggling. He said he wanted them to know they were not alone. "It is not your shame and it is not your guilt," he said, adding "and you do not have to carry it alone". Mr Moore praised the "incredible courage" of brothers, David and Mark Ryan and their friend Maura Harmon, who revealed the abuse that had been happening in Willow Park and Blackrock College in their groundbreaking documentary "Blackrock Boys", broadcast on RTÉ Radio one in November 2022. He said many men had come forward to tell their stories since. He said others remained silent, and perhaps thought nothing would happen if they spoke up. However, he said today something had been achieved, and a paedophile was "where he belongs, behind bars". Mr Moore said even though these offences happened almost 50 years ago, paedophiles had not gone away. And he believed it was incumbent on every adult to look out for the welfare of children and be proactive in protecting innocent young lives from predatory paedophiles. He said it remained very much a live issue. He said he was standing in front of the courts because if it made a difference in even one person’s life, it would be worth it Mr Moore said the end of the trial and the sentencing was a huge relief and he had not expected the sentence to be as long as it was. He said it had been a very painful process to go through for all victims. He said he hoped other people would come forward so the extent of the abuse at the two schools would be known. Mr Moore also criticised the length of time being taken by the Spiritan order to set up a redress scheme. He said he had gone through an extremely painful settlement process and hoped other people would be able to avoid this. Mr Moore said he would never get over this. He said the effect of child sexual abuse was evident every day. He said it affected his wife, children and everyone who knew him. Spiritan Province 'deeply sorry' for harm In a statement this afternoon, the Spiritan Province said it was "deeply sorry" for the harm caused by Peter Kelly while he was a teacher at Willow Park School. The statement said their thoughts were with those who were abused as children by Kelly, and with their loved ones. And they said they hoped the court's verdict and the sentence passed today brought them some measure of validation and justice. The Spiritans said they offered them the same sincere apology that they extended to all who suffered abuse in their schools. The order said it had begun a Restorative Justice process for victims and survivors, and encouraged anyone affected to come forward. It said support was available through the Restore Together Group, the Restorative Justice Team and its services, and the Spiritan Safeguarding Office. Those affected have strongly criticised the amount of time taken by the order to put in place a redress scheme for them. In an earlier statement issued in October, the Spiritan Province said they acknowledged the deep pain and frustration suffered by victims and survivors and also acknowledged progress had not been as fast as anyone would wish. It outlined steps being taken to sell properties in order to make resources available for redress payments. Victim impact statements Last week the court heard victim impact statements from a number of the men. The first man to give his statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he did not want Kelly near him, but he could not get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do to make sure Kelly would not notice him so he would not touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he would not have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse had not happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it could not just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. Aidan Moore told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by Edward Baylor. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. He broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Others also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Judge Sheahan said she hoped today’s sentencing would bring them closure. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

The fund, if approved by the SEC, would give BlackRock investors indirect exposure to staked Ether, one of the industry’s first following the 2024 approval of spot Ether ETFs. US-based asset management company BlackRock has applied to list and trade shares of an investment vehicle tied to staked Ether, following its offering of other cryptocurrency products. In a Friday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock filed a Form S-1 registration statement for its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund. The filing is part of the SEC’s process for companies to list investment vehicles such as ETFs, but does not guarantee approval. Shares of the staked Ether (ETH) fund, which BlackRock intends to list and trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker ETHB, could be one of the first offerings tied to staked cryptocurrencies. Grayscale Investments added staking functionality to its previously approved spot ETH and mini ETH trusts in October. The regulator has not greenlighted many crypto staking funds since initially approving spot Ether ETFs in May 2024. However, Canary Capital made a similar SEC filing for a staked Injective (INJ) product in July, and Grayscale and Bitwise launched separate staking products tied to Solana (SOL) in October. BlackRock manages the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which is listed under the ticker symbol IBIT. Related: Spot Ether ETF staking could ‘dramatically reshape the market’ Larry Fink, who co-founded BlackRock in 1988, said before Bitcoin’s 2017 bull run that the cryptocurrency “shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” In the years since, and as the US digital asset market grew in volume and usage, the CEO has made more bullish remarks on crypto investments, including by supporting BlackRock’s launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF and others. In The New York Times’ DealBook Summit last week, Fink said he had had a “big shift” in his opinions of crypto, but still referred to BTC as an “asset of fear.” Magazine: XRP’s ‘now or never’ moment, Kalshi taps Solana: Hodler’s Digest, Nov. 30 – Dec. 6 Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Will Ripple Dump 25% Of Its 45 Billion XRP Holdings Soon? Here’s The 411
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-dump-25-45-billion-xrp/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T15:00:08Z

Ripple currently controls a staggering amount of XRP, and now questions from market experts are mounting over whether the crypto payments company may be forced to sell 25% of its 45 billion token holdings. Analysts suggest that a possible selloff could have major implications. At the same time, they question the pathways through which Ripple could sell its holdings and who the potential buyers might be. Ripple may soon need to drastically reduce more than half of its substantial XRP reserves as regulatory discussions over the proposed CLARITY Act intensify. In a recent post on X, market expert Crypto Sensei shared a video, drawing attention to a provision in the CLARITY Act that would prevent any company from controlling more than 20% of a blockchain’s native asset’s total supply. Currently, Ripple owns 45 billion XRP, split between escrow and direct reserve, representing 45% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply of 100 billion tokens. This indicates that the company controls nearly half of the total XRP supply—a level of concentration that typically runs counter to the decentralization narrative of crypto and blockchain technology. Crypto Sensei suggests that US lawmakers are seemingly focused on preventing excessive accumulation of supply, and Ripple’s holdings stand out as one of the clearest examples of a single entity controlling a large portion of a network’s token. According to the analyst, if the CLARITY Act is implemented in 2026, Ripple may need to sell at least 25% of its holdings to comply with the legislation. A reduction of this magnitude would lower the crypto company’s XRP reserves to 20 billion tokens, or 20% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. At the current price of $2.0 per token, this would amount to roughly $40 billion. Notably, such a sell-off would likely require coordination with liquidity providers and partnering institutions to avoid unnecessary market disruption. In his X video, Crypto Sensei outlined several potential paths Ripple could take to reduce its substantial XRP reserves. One option is to sell the rights to future escrow releases instead of the tokens themselves. Another involves selling the accounts into which the escrowed XRP completes while preventing the tokens from circulating. According to the market expert, these possibilities have sparked widespread speculation that major financial players, such as BlackRock, could already be involved or poised to purchase future XRP escrow rights. The idea continues to circulate because it would allow institutions to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without immediately affecting the circulating supply. Crypto Sensei also notes that Ripple locks about 700 million XRP in escrow each month, raising questions about whether these transfers may represent sales. The analyst argues that if sales were occurring, the on-chain trail would clearly show tokens moving to buyers’ wallets, but the data does not reflect this. He highlighted that the current evidence points to a far more controlled internal process rather than large-scale institutional distributions. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Former teacher jailed for indecent assault of young boys

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent A former maths teacher at a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in south Dublin has been jailed for ten years for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Kelly was a teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock for almost 30 years. The 73-year-old was found guilty by a jury earlier this year of 28 counts of indecent assault. One man told the court that Kelly was "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse" at Willow Park and secondary school, Blackrock College. Kelly began teaching at Willow Park primary school in 1977. He resigned in 2004 after an investigation following a complaint made in 2001. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute him at that stage. However, earlier this year, he went on trial at the Circuit Criminal Court, charged with 28 counts of indecent assault against eight boys. All were aged between around 10 and 13 when the assaults took place. Some of the offences took place in the classroom and some in changing rooms. Kelly denied the charges but was convicted by a jury last month. The court heard that he does not accept the verdicts. Many of the boys gave evidence that Kelly wore a black gown and would put them under his gown and cuddle and fondle them - something he referred to as "The Muppet Show". He would also tickle boys, calling it "death by tickles", slap them, bounce them on his crotch and touch their genital areas or make them touch his. The boys also gave evidence of physical punishment, although this did not form part of the charges against Kelly. However, the prosecution case was that he used physical and sexual violence to demean the boys in his class. The boys are now men in their 50s and the court heard emotional and moving victim impact statements from all eight of them. Most described suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Some had struggled with addiction and lived with self doubt, fear, depression and anxiety. Judge notes bravery of men In her sentencing remarks, Judge Elma Sheahan said she was struck by the bravery of the men. She said they had to bare their souls in front of their families and strangers, and she was struck by the eloquent expression of their very real and ongoing hurt and torment. The judge noted the damage done to the men as well as the intergenerational hurt caused to the men's partners and children. She said they had waited for decades to tell their stories and to be believed. Judge Sheahan said their families may not have understood at the time why they behaved a certain way as young boys - withdrawing, refusing to attend school and even moving abroad. She said the worry and upset caused to those close to the victims was another aspect of the harm done. The judge pointed out that it was not just the young age of the boys which made them vulnerable. She said some of them were already traumatised from the loss of a parent, or from more severe abuse at the hands of other teachers at Willow Park. The judge said she noted the further hurt caused to some of his victims in comments that he made during his evidence to his trial. She said this was very unfortunate, but was ultimately rejected by the jury. Judge Sheahan said the gravity of the offending was significant. She said the aggravating factors were the seriousness of the offending, Kelly’s position in the boys' lives, the breach of trust, the age disparity, the repetitive nature of the offending and the number of children abused. Other aggravating factors, the judge said, were the vulnerability of the children and the fact that some of the offending took place in the classroom in front of their peers. In mitigation, she said she took into consideration the lack of previous convictions, as well as Kelly’s age and ill health. The judge was told that he suffers from a number of physical and psychological issues, including metastatic prostate cancer. She said she noted a testimonial by Kelly’s brother in relation to his efforts to help those in need in his community. Most of the offences carried a maximum sentence of ten years although some carried a maximum of two years because of the dates on which they were committed. Judge Sheahan said "having stood back" and looked at the case in its entirety, she would impose a total sentence of ten years in prison. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former Willow Park teacher jailed for ten years over indecent assault of eight boys

A former teacher at Willow Park primary school in south Dublin has been jailed for a total term of ten years for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago. Because Peter Kelly (73), who grew up and lived all his life in Booterstown, did not accept the verdict of a jury at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that he was guilty of 28 counts of indecent assault, there was “no basis” to suspend any of the ten-year term, Judge Elma Sheahan said. She was impressed by the bravery of the eight survivors, who had to “bare their souls” in victim impact statements, and the eloquent expression of their “very real hurt and torment”. All eight were “already vulnerable children” at the time of the offences. They had suffered real trauma, whether as the result of the death of a parent or abuse by another person. Four had been abused by another person at the school, she noted. As a result of Kelly’s abuse, they suffered “real damage”, including addiction in some cases, psychological injury and inter-generational trauma. They had “waited for decades” to tell their stories and to be believed and had suffered hurt due to lack of understanding about why they behaved in certain ways, including withdrawal, addiction and even moving abroad. The court also acknowledged the “brutal” nature of the trial process. The accused was entitled to have the State prove its case, but that could cause further hurt by comments made during the process, which were ultimately rejected by the jury. The aggravating factors were the seriousness of the offending, the position of the accused, the breach of trust, age disparity, repetitive nature of the offending, number of children involved, their vulnerability due to age and their own personal circumstances and the fact some of his offending was done in front of their peers, causing shame and embarrassment, the judge said. In mitigation, the judge took into account Kelly has no previous convictions and that his time in custody will be more difficult because of that and his age. She also noted his significant physical frailties and ill health, including prostate cancer, eye and kidney problems, and an anxiety disorder; efforts to help people in need in his community and his long history of employment. The single greatest mitigating factor in a case is a guilty plea but that was not available here and he did not accept the jury verdict, she said. The judge said there are different ranges of offending into which offences of indecent and sexual assault fall and the fact that two year and ten year maximum sentences applied to some of the offences reflected those changes. It is “profoundly degrading” for any person to be subject to any sexual assault and all sexual assaults are serious, she said. She imposed sentences ranging from 20 months to years in relation to each complainant and made some of those consecutive and some concurrent. After saying sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the personal circumstances of the offender, she impose a global total sentence of ten years. “I hope this brings some closure to the victims,” the judge concluded. Kelly, who taught at Willow Park primary school from 1977 until 2004, was convicted last month of 28 counts of indecently assaulting the eight boys on various dates in the 1970s and the 1980s at the school. The school was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, now the Spiritans, and one of the eight survivors of Kelly’s abuse told the court his former teacher had worked for an institution “that tolerated widespread sexual abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College”. “Thirty seven abusers were identified in this, he was a mere cog in a machine of systematic abuse,” the man said. “We as children had no chance.” All eight complainants, who were aged between 10 and 13 at the time of the offences, read or provided victim impact statements to the court last week. Six complainants attended court to read their statements while the remaining two statements were read by Inspector Rachel Kilpatrick, who was involved from 2021 in a large scale Garda investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College and Willow Park primary school. A number of complainants referred to Kelly engaging in what he called the ‘Muppet Show’ in the classroom, in which he would take a boy under his black cloak and, under the guise of tickling them, would run his hands up and down their torsos and buttocks. Kelly also pulled some complainants onto his lap and bounced them aggressively up and down in front of the class while pushing his body against their backs. The judge was also told Kelly brought some boys to stand in front of the class, stood behind them and took hold of their hands and moved their hands up and down all over their bodies while standing close behind them and pushing his body into theirs. One complainant described this as akin to “a humiliation ritual”. Many of the offences took place in the classroom but one complainant was assaulted on four occasions by Kelly in a rugby changing room, including being held face down across Kelly’s knee while the teacher slapped his bottom and pushed him up towards his penis. Another complainant was assaulted where gym equipment was stored, involving being made bend over a gym horse and having his buttocks rubbed and slapped. One complainant alleged, during an occasion when he was held back at school by Kelly, the teacher put his hands inside his underpants and digitally penetrated his anus. All eight statements outlined serious adverse impacts of the abuse. Some complainants suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and some spoke of experiencing suicidal ideation.

December 08, 2025 09:20 ET | Source: Intercont Cayman Intercont Cayman HONG KONG, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intercont (Cayman) Limited (Nasdaq: NCT)(“NCT” or “the Group”), a global carbon-neutral shipping company, announced that, it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to acquire a less than 50% minority stake of Starks Network Ltd (“Starks Network” or “the Company”) , a leading Singapore-based Web3 technology service provider and will co-develop the Project zCloak Network (“zCloak”). This strategic agreement marks a signiﬁcant milestone, positioning NCT and zCloak to jointly advance the integration of maritime services and blockchain technology. Starks Network, incorporated in the Cayman Islands with operational headquarters in Singapore, has established strong competitive advantages in the global Web3 ecosystem with Project zCloak Network. The company’s proprietary frameworks and compliance-forward infrastructure span AI identity, enterprise self-custodial wallets, stablecoin payment systems, and AI-powered crypto payment technologies. These differentiated capabilities create substantial barriers to entry and have earned zCloak grant by ofﬁcial Hong Kong Cyberport incubation programs, as well as investments from top-tier venture capital ﬁrms including Coinbase Ventures. zCloak is widely regarded as a high-growth technology leader with robust investor support. zCloak Network Vision The global adoption of stablecoin-based payment systems has accelerated rapidly. With the static by Stablecoin Insider, worldwide stablecoin transaction volume has surpassed the combined annual processing volume of Visa and Mastercard in 2024—an inﬂection point signaling stablecoins’ emergence as critical ﬁnancial infrastructure.[1] Meanwhile, McKinsey points out the growth rate of stablecoin transaction is in accelerating tendency and could surpass legacy payment volumes in less than a decade. On that basis, as on-chain payment matures, institutional and enterprise clients continue to demonstrate strong demand for secure, extensible, and compliant wallet solutions.[2] BlackRock reported $13.46 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in Q3 2025, underscoring the early participation of major financial institutions.[3] Meanwhile, the overall digital asset market capitalization surged from $5 billion in 2022 to over $25.5 billion by July 2025, representing growth of approximately 410%.[4] As digital assets become a central driver of innovation in global finance, governments and financial institutions worldwide are racing to establish strategic footholds. Bitcoin image NCT’s planned acquisition of zCloak represents a decisive step in its long-term strategy to expand into the digitization of real-world assets while reinforcing its leadership in global shipping services. The company will explore diversified pathways for tokenizing real-world assets across industries, leveraging zCloak’s technical infrastructure to deliver standardized, compliant, and scale up on-chain asset solutions. Together, both the NCT and Starks Network aim to accelerate enterprise adoption of Web3 technologies worldwide. Ms. Muchun Zhu, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of NCT, and Dr. Xiao Zhang, Founder of Starks Network and zCloak, described this partnership as a bold convergence of tradition and innovation: “Four hundred years after Shakespeare, the Merchant of Venice sails again — on-chain.” Through this collaboration, timeless themes of contract, wealth, humanity, and justice will be re-imagined using Web3 technology. Ms. Zhu added: “The markets zCloak operates in are already producing meaningful commercial outcomes. In privacy-preserving identity, compliance verification, and confidential computation, leading infrastructure providers routinely achieve the US$30–40 million annual revenue range, driven by institutional adoption and high-margin enterprise integration. We see a similar structural demand forming around zCloak’s technology. Our acquisition positions NCT to participate in these high-value verticals. While this does not represent a projection of future performance, it illustrates the exponential revenue potential associated with the infrastructure layer we are now building. We believe zCloak gives us a credible entry point into a rapidly expanding market, and we intend to execute aggressively.” About Intercont (Cayman) Limited Intercont (Cayman) Limited is a global shipping enterprise with plans for seaborne pulping operations.

Title: BlackRock Files for Staked Ethereum ETF

BlackRock has officially filed for a staked Ethereum ETH$3,320.02 exchange-traded fund, marking a key step in bringing staking exposure to the masses. The world’s largest asset manager submitted an S-1 registration statement with the U.S. SEC on Friday. The filing kicks off the review process, but to trigger a formal deadline for SEC approval or denial, the fund’s listing exchange must still submit a separate 19b-4 form. The proposed fund, called the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ETHB), was first hinted at in November when BlackRock registered the name in Delaware. That move signaled intent but didn't count as a formal application with the SEC. This isn’t BlackRock’s first Ethereum ETF. The firm launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024 alongside other issuers. But at the time, the SEC—then led by Chair Gary Gensler—reportedly instructed firms to strip out staking components from their filings. The agency had previously argued that staking services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase could constitute unregistered securities offerings. Under new Chair Paul Atkins, that position appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck are now among several issuers resubmitting or amending ETF filings to include staking. While others are modifying their existing products, BlackRock opted to launch an entirely new fund. ETHA, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking version. The staked fund, if approved, would give investors exposure to Ethereum’s yield-generating mechanism without having to stake assets themselves.

Share this article BlackRock plans to stake most of its Ethereum holdings through a new exchange-traded fund structure, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF seeks to stake 70% to 90% of its Ethereum holdings under normal market circumstances, the filing shows. The product will hold Ethereum and distribute staking rewards, minus fees, to shareholders at least quarterly. The trust will use third-party staking service providers selected by the Ether Custodian to operate validators. Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as the primary custodian, while Anchorage Digital Bank has been added as an alternative custodian. The trust may reduce staking if the sponsor determines the activity raises regulatory concerns or risks the trust’s grantor trust tax status. Shares will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ETHB.

Share this article BlackRock deposited 1,198 Bitcoin worth around $110 million and 24,792 Ethereum worth about $78 million to Coinbase Prime today, according to Arkham Intelligence data. The asset manager’s latest transfers came amid Bitcoin’s rally to $92,000. The digital asset was trading at $91,767 at press time, up approximately 3% in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. BlackRock’s on-chain movements often draw scrutiny given the firm manages the world’s leading Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products. Its ETFs have shown mixed momentum in recent weeks. The IBIT fund saw $49 million in net outflows last week, while its Ethereum ETF shed $82.5 million, according to Farside Investors. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Citadel’s shot at Andreessen Horowitz points to coming battle over DeFi and U.S. stock trading

Time Published: 2025-12-08T11:50:57Z
Full Content:
A quiet fight between two of the most powerful names in finance burst into the open last week. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Citadel Securities complained that crypto interests are poised to damage the U.S. stock market and harm consumer protections with a pell-mell rush into decentralized finance (DeFi). The firm didn’t directly say who it regards as responsible for this state of affairs—but it’s enough to guess from the footnotes, which refer to the venture giant Andreessen Horowitz more than 10 times. The source of the dispute is the fast-growing world of tokenized equities, which let users trade shares of popular companies but in a blockchain wrapper. The likes of Robinhood, Kraken, and even BlackRock are all dabbling in this technology, whose advantages include easy 24/7 trading and instant settlement. Holding stock on a blockchain also reduces middlemen, and expands opportunities to deploy equity-based collateral. So what’s not to like? According to Citadel, the problem is DeFi platforms like Uniswap. Right now, traders use them to swap billions of dollars of crypto every day—and soon large volumes of tokenized Nvidia or Apple stock could be sloshing around these platforms, too. And if the SEC grants certain exemptions that Andreessen and its DeFi allies are seeking, Uniswap and others will get to operate as de facto brokerages—without taking on the legal responsibilities that go with that. These include displaying the price of every trade or ensuring customers get the best price. Citadel also warns of “fragmenting liquidity” as stock investing gets split between two parallel systems. In response to the letter, the founder of Uniswap (one of Andreessen’s blue-ribbon portfolio companies) took to X to accuse Citadel of slandering DeFi in order to protect its lucrative role as the “king of shady tradfi market makers.” Other prominent names in crypto piled on as well, accusing the firm of trying to smother innovation. At first glance, it appears both sides have a point. If tokenized stock trading breaks into the mainstream, it would threaten Citadel’s business model of paying firms like Robinhood for their orders and using that volume to make trading profits. So the company’s letter to the SEC is clearly based in self-interest. That said, Citadel’s concerns about liquidity are not unreasonable—if the pool of U.S. stocks is divided into two separate pools, doesn’t that make trading more expensive for everyone? Likewise, it’s fair to ask if the SEC would be wise to grant exemptions on investor protection rules that have historically served the public very well. In reading the letter, it’s remarkable to read its claims that the likes of automated AMMs, block builders, validators and layer 2 blockchains are basically brokerages—less for the argument itself, than that Citadel and the SEC are discussing this stuff at all. It wasn’t long ago when only a handful of crypto diehards knew what these terms even meant. Now, they have become mainstream enough to be part of a non-crypto firm’s correspondence with the SEC, and there is no doubt they’re here to stay. As for which side is going to prevail, it’s worth noting the fight pits two of the most powerful firms in the country against each other. On one side, there is Citadel, which is owned by Ken Griffin, one of the richest and most combative people in the country. On the other is Andreessen, an influential VC firm that doubles as a PR firm and lobbying agency with immense clout in Washington, DC. For now, it feels Griffin may be able to slow down the spread of tokenized equities but, as with any superior technology, he will be unable to stop it.

Title: Former Willow Park teacher faces sentence for indecent assault of eight boys
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/08/former-willow-park-teacher-faces-sentence-for-indecent-assault-of-eight-boys/
Time Published: 2025-12-08T11:27:24Z
Full Content:
A former teacher at Willow Park primary school in south Dublin has been jailed for a total term of ten years for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago. Because Peter Kelly (73), who grew up and lived all his life in Booterstown, did not accept the verdict of a jury at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that he was guilty of 28 counts of indecent assault, there was “no basis” to suspend any of the ten-year term, Judge Elma Sheahan said. She was impressed by the bravery of the eight survivors, who had to “bare their souls” in victim impact statements, and the eloquent expression of their “very real hurt and torment”. All eight were “already vulnerable children” at the time of the offences. They had suffered real trauma, whether as the result of the death of a parent or abuse by another person. Four had been abused by another person at the school, she noted. As a result of Kelly’s abuse, they suffered “real damage”, including addiction in some cases, psychological injury and inter-generational trauma. They had “waited for decades” to tell their stories and to be believed and had suffered hurt due to lack of understanding about why they behaved in certain ways, including withdrawal, addiction and even moving abroad. The court also acknowledged the “brutal” nature of the trial process. The accused was entitled to have the State prove its case, but that could cause further hurt by comments made during the process, which were ultimately rejected by the jury. The aggravating factors were the seriousness of the offending, the position of the accused, the breach of trust, age disparity, repetitive nature of the offending, number of children involved, their vulnerability due to age and their own personal circumstances and the fact some of his offending was done in front of their peers, causing shame and embarrassment, the judge said. In mitigation, the judge took into account Kelly has no previous convictions and that his time in custody will be more difficult because of that and his age. She also noted his significant physical frailties and ill health, including prostate cancer, eye and kidney problems, and an anxiety disorder; efforts to help people in need in his community and his long history of employment. The single greatest mitigating factor in a case is a guilty plea but that was not available here and he did not accept the jury verdict, she said. The judge said there are different ranges of offending into which offences of indecent and sexual assault fall and the fact that two year and ten year maximum sentences applied to some of the offences reflected those changes. It is “profoundly degrading” for any person to be subject to any sexual assault and all sexual assaults are serious, she said. She imposed sentences ranging from 20 months to years in relation to each complainant and made some of those consecutive and some concurrent. After saying sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the personal circumstances of the offender, she impose a global total sentence of ten years. “I hope this brings some closure to the victims,” the judge concluded. Kelly, who taught at Willow Park primary school from 1977 until 2004, was convicted last month of 28 counts of indecently assaulting the eight boys on various dates in the 1970s and the 1980s at the school. The school was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, now the Spiritans, and one of the eight survivors of Kelly’s abuse told the court his former teacher had worked for an institution “that tolerated widespread sexual abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College”. “Thirty seven abusers were identified in this, he was a mere cog in a machine of systematic abuse,” the man said. “We as children had no chance.” All eight complainants, who were aged between 10 and 13 at the time of the offences, read or provided victim impact statements to the court last week. Six complainants attended court to read their statements while the remaining two statements were read by Inspector Rachel Kilpatrick, who was involved from 2021 in a large scale Garda investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College and Willow Park primary school. A number of complainants referred to Kelly engaging in what he called the ‘Muppet Show’ in the classroom, in which he would take a boy under his black cloak and, under the guise of tickling them, would run his hands up and down their torsos and buttocks. Kelly also pulled some complainants onto his lap and bounced them aggressively up and down in front of the class while pushing his body against their backs. The judge was also told Kelly brought some boys to stand in front of the class, stood behind them and took hold of their hands and moved their hands up and down all over their bodies while standing close behind them and pushing his body into theirs. One complainant described this as akin to “a humiliation ritual”. Many of the offences took place in the classroom but one complainant was assaulted on four occasions by Kelly in a rugby changing room, including being held face down across Kelly’s knee while the teacher slapped his bottom and pushed him up towards his penis. Another complainant was assaulted where gym equipment was stored, involving being made bend over a gym horse and having his buttocks rubbed and slapped. One complainant alleged, during an occasion when he was held back at school by Kelly, the teacher put his hands inside his underpants and digitally penetrated his anus. All eight statements outlined serious adverse impacts of the abuse. Some complainants suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and some spoke of experiencing suicidal ideation.

Title: XRP leads ETF ‘boom’ with $900m. Why price will go higher, Bitwise exec says

About us Copy link XRP is quickly becoming the star of cryptocurrency’s exchange-traded fund boom. Spot ETFs backed by the fourth-largest crypto have pulled in $898 million since their blockbuster launch in November, SoSoValue data shows. That is triple Solana products’ $270 million in the same time frame. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.6 billion in selloffs, while Ethereum ETFs shed $691 million, DefiLlama data shows. “The ETF boom will continue,” Bitwise Asset Management executive Katherine Dowling told DL News. “It is a good starter kit for many investors to gain exposure.” “Both Solana and XRP have promising fundamentals that make sense and the ETF launches should push demand and therefore prices higher,” Dowling said. At the moment, both tokens trade over 40% below their all-time highs set earlier this year as the overall crypto market reels from a $1.2 trillion downturn. The predictions land as Vanguard — the $11 trillion asset management colossus — changed course and finally launched spot crypto ETF trading last week, becoming the latest institutional stalwart to jump into the ring. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, was seen as Wall Street’s most stubborn holdout. It now allows more than 50 million of its brokerage clients to buy and sell regulated crypto ETFs. The move was a major concession to investor demand. The firm joins fellow giants BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which have all jumped on the crypto ETF bandwagon over the past two years. “It took a new CEO plus more than a year after that hire to move this Vanguard ship to a yes,” Dowling said. “They are not too late as there is more capital out there to come in but there is no doubt they watched a lot of capital leave to ports accepting the crypto ETF ships,” she added. When asked about BlackRock sitting out XRP ETFs so far, Dowling cited “a host of factors focused on market demand and liquidity. Perhaps even regulatory.” “But Blackrock also knows that with their name they can come in late and still take market share. Reality is they don’t need to be first to get AUM and can wait and see,” she said. “All of the tokens are scrambling to get issuers to launch ETFs because this is ultimately beneficial to the token because in theory the ETF should increase demand for the token and therefore price,” Dowling said. “More will be coming.” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Crypto funds log second week of inflows after massive $5.5B sell-off

Bitcoin led the $716 million of inflows to crypto ETPs last week, while Chainlink saw record gains, accounting for more than 50% of its AUM. Cryptocurrency investment products maintained upward momentum last week, logging two consecutive weeks of gains following substantial outflows. Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted $716 million in inflows, adding to the previous week’s gains of $1 billion, European crypto asset manager CoinShares reported on Monday. “Daily data highlighted minor outflows on Thursday and Friday in what we believe was a response to macroeconomic data in the US alluding to ongoing inflationary pressures,” CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, said in the update. The new inflows pushed total assets under management (AUM) above $180 billion, marking an 8% rebound from November lows following $5.5 billion of outflows in four weeks. However, AUM remained well below its all-time high of $264 billion, Butterfill noted. Bitcoin (BTC) led crypto ETP gains last week, attracting $352 million in inflows, followed by XRP (XRP) funds with $244 million. Chainlink (LINK) stood out with a record inflow of $52.8 million, which represented 54% of its AUM. Ether (ETH) funds saw minor inflows of $39 million, while short Bitcoin ETPs posted around $19 million in outflows, potentially indicating a lessening of negative sentiment. Among issuers, ProShares led inflows with $210 million, while BlackRock — the largest issuer by AUM — experienced $105 million in outflows. Cathie Wood’s ARK and Grayscale Investments also saw outflows, recording $78 million and $7 million, respectively, last week. Geographically, almost all regions globally saw inflows, with the most notable being the US, Germany and Canada, with inflows of $483 million, $97 million and $80.7 million, respectively.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has said a local authority in south Dublin approached it for additional funding for the controversial construction of a new entrance to a suburban park at Mount Merrion as it had encountered challenges on the site and design issues. The Irish Times reported last month that the works, which involved the provision of 14 steps and a ramp at Deer Park, had cost a total of €753,528.43 inclusive of VAT. Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil subsequently that the cost involved in the project was “excessive by any yardstick”. Sinn Féin contended that it represented another example of a waste of public money. The park at Mount Merrion is run by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council but funding for the project was provided by the NTA. The NTA did not directly answer questions about whether it had raised concerns with the local authority about the cost of the renovation of the entrance to the park. The NTA said that in 2023 Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council had applied for “active travel” funding to improve the access to Deer Park from North Avenue in Mount Merrion as the existing steps were unsuitable for those with mobility impairments, cyclists or those using buggies or push chairs. It said the project aimed to construct a ramp and replace the existing steps to improve accessibility for all to the park and between the park, the adjacent primary school and local church. The NTA said in addition, “this link formed part of a wider 6.2km ‘Sea to Mountains’ active travel route, which connects Blackrock to Kilmacud” in south Dublin. It said this provided safe and inclusive access for walking, wheeling and cycling to neighbourhood schools, shops and community facilities. “Following funding approval, a contractor was appointed and works began in October 2023. In 2024, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown requested additional funding due to challenges on site and design issues. The NTA requested detailed cost reports as the project progressed and conducted a site visit in August 2025. Additional funding was approved to allow the project to be completed, ensure the site was safe and that the link to and through the park was accessible to the community. The project was substantially completed in January 2025”, the transport authority said. The NTA said “as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council were the project managers and are responsible for ensuring the project was progressed in accordance with applicable legislation and standards, any detailed information on these costs should be directed to them”. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council told The Irish Times last month that the works at Deer Park represented “a significant engineering project that encountered many challenges during the construction including the discovery of previously unidentified electrical cables”. It said these had to be relocated. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said in the Dáil: “Access to public spaces for people with disabilities is very important, but for €750,000 I was expecting a breathtaking feat of engineering. There is nothing spectacular, however. In fact, it is very ordinary, literally just steps and a ramp. The only breathtaking thing about this is the cost,” she said. Ms McDonald said the money involved “would pay the salaries of 20 new special needs assistants or 20 new nurses for a year”. “Instead, the money is spent on a few steps and a ramp that surely could have been built for a fraction of that cost. It is scandalous.” Mr Martin said: “First of all, I do not believe €750,000 is right, proper or appropriate in terms of 14 steps, but it seems to me the scheme that was completed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was not just about 14 steps. Nonetheless, the cost is excessive by any yardstick.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: What bubble? Asset managers in risk-on mode stick with stocks

There’s a time when investments run their course and the prudent move is to cash out. For global asset managers who’ve ridden double-digit gains in equities for three straight years, that time is not now. “Our expectation of solid growth and easier monetary and fiscal policies supports a risk-on tilt in our multi-asset portfolios. We remain overweight stocks and credit,” said Sylvia Sheng, global multi-asset strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are playing the powerful trends in place and are bullish through the end of next year,” said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS. “For now we are not contrarians.” “Start the year with sufficient exposure, even over-exposure to equities, predominantly in emerging market equities,” said Nannette Hechler-Fayd’herbe, EMEA chief investment officer at Lombard Odier. “We don’t expect a recession in 2026 to unfold.” Those assessments came from Bloomberg News interviews with 39 investment managers across the US, Asia and Europe, including at BlackRock Inc., Allianz Global Investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Franklin Templeton. More than three-quarters of the allocators were positioning portfolios for a risk-on environment through 2026. The thrust of the bet is that resilient global growth, further developments in artificial intelligence, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus will deliver outsize returns in all fashion of global equity markets. The call is not without risks, including simply its pervasiveness among the respondents, along with their overall high degree of assuredness. The view among the institutional investors also aligns with that of sell-side strategists around the globe. Should the bullishness play out as expected, it would deliver a stunning fourth straight year of bumper returns for the MSCI All-Country World Index. That would extend a run that’s added $42 trillion in market capitalization since the end of 2022 — the most value created for equity investors in history. That’s not to say the optimism is without merit. The artificial intelligence trade has added trillions in market value to dozens of firms plying the industry, but just three years after ChatGPT broke into the public consciousness, AI remains in the early phase of development. The buy-side managers largely rejected the idea that the technology has blown a bubble in equity markets. While many acknowledged some pockets of froth in unprofitable tech names, 85% of managers said valuations among the Magnificent Seven and other AI heavyweights are not overly inflated. Fundamentals back the trade, they said, which marks the beginning of a new industrial cycle. “You can’t call it a bubble when you’re seeing tech companies deliver a massive earnings beat. In fact, earnings from the sector have outstripped all other US stocks,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, global co-chief investment officer at Northern Trust Asset Management. As such, investors expect the US to remain the engine of the rally. “American exceptionalism is far from dead,” said Jose Rasco, chief investment officer at HSBC Americas. “As artificial intelligence continues to spread around the globe, the US will be a key participant.” Most investors echoed the sentiment expressed by Helen Jewell, international chief investment officer of fundamental equities at BlackRock, who suggested also searching outside the US for meaningful upside. “The US is where the high-return high-growth companies are, so we have to be realistic about that. But those are already reflected in valuations, and there are probably more interesting opportunities outside the US,” she said. Profits matter above all else for equity investors, and huge bumps in government spending from Europe to Asia have stoked estimates for strong gains in earnings. “We have begun to see a meaningful broadening of earnings momentum, both across market capitalizations and across regions, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea,” said Wellington Management equity strategist Andrew Heiskell. “Looking into 2026, we see clear potential for a revival of earnings growth in Europe and a wider range of emerging markets.” India is one of the most compelling opportunities for 2026, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions. “We see real potential for India to become the Korea-like re-rating story of 2026, a market that transitions from tactical allocation to strategic core exposure in global portfolios,” she said. Nelson Yu, head of equities at AllianceBernstein, said he sees improvements outside of the US that will mandate allocations. He noted governance reform in Japan, capital discipline in Europe and recovering profitability in some emerging markets. At the sector level, the investors are looking for AI proxies, notably among clean energy providers that can help meet the technology’s ravenous demand for power. Smaller stocks are also finding favor. “The earnings outlook has brightened for small-capitalization stocks, industrials and financials,” said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of Franklin Templeton Institute. “Small-cap stocks and industrials, which are typically more highly leveraged than the rest of the market, will see profitability rise as the Federal Reserve trims interest rates and debt servicing costs fall.” Over at Santander Asset Management, Francisco Simón sees earnings growth of more than 20% for US small caps after years of underperformance. Reflecting the optimism, the Russell 2000 Index of such equities recently hit a record high. Meanwhile, the combination of low valuations and strong fundamentals makes health care one of the most compelling contrarian opportunities in a bullish cycle, a preponderance of managers said. “Health-care related sectors can surprise to the upside in the US markets,” said Jim Caron, chief investment officer of cross-asset solutions at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “This is a mid-term election year and policy may at the margin support many companies. Valuations are still attractive and have a lot of catch up to do.” Virtually every allocator struck at least a note of caution about what lies ahead. The top worry among them was a rekindling of inflation in the US. If the Fed is forced by rising prices to abruptly pause or even end its easing cycle, the potential for turbulence is high. “A scenario — which is not our base case — whereby US inflation rebounds in 2026 would constitute a double whammy for multi-asset funds as it would penalize both stocks and bonds. In this sense it would be much worse than an economic slowdown,” said Amélie Derambure, senior multi-asset portfolio manager at Amundi SA. “The way investors are headed for 2026, they need to have the Fed on their side,” she added. Another worry is around President Donald Trump’s capriciousness, particularly when it comes to trade. Any flareup in his trade spats that fuels inflation through heightened tariffs would weigh on risk assets. Oil and gas producers remain unloved by the group, though that could change if a major geopolitical event upends supply lines. While such an outcome would bolster those sectors, the overall impact would likely be negative for risk assets, they said. “Any geopolitical situation that can affect the price of oil is what will have the largest impact on the financial markets. Clearly both the Middle East and the Ukraine/Russia situations can impact oil prices,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Multiple respondents flagged European autos as a “no-go” area for 2026, citing intense competitive pressure from Chinese carmakers, margin compression and structural challenges in the transition to electric vehicles. “Personally I don’t believe for a minute that there will be a rebound in the sector,” said Isabelle de Gavoty at Allianz GI. Outside of those worries, most asset managers simply believe that there’s little reason to fret about the upward momentum being interrupted — outside, of course, from the contrarian signal such near-uniform bullishness sends. “Everyone seems to be risk-on at the moment, and that worries me a bit in the sense that the concentration of positions creates less tolerance for adverse surprises,” said Amundi’s Derambure.

Title: The Ways the AI Bubble Might Burst

[Editor's Note: this piece previously said "Blackstone" instead of "Blackrock," which has now been fixed.] I've been struggling to think about what to write this week, if only because I've written so much recently and because, if I'm honest, things aren't really making a lot of sense. NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs in the last four quarters — as I went into in my last premium piece — working out to somewhere between 10GW and 12GW of power (based on the power draw of B100 and B200 GPUs and GB200 and GB300 racks), which...does not make sense based on the amount of actual data center capacity brought online. Similarly, Anthropic claims to be approaching $10 billion in annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a month — which would make it competitive with OpenAI's projected $13 billion in revenue, though I should add that based on my reporting extrapolating OpenAI's revenues from Microsoft's revenue share, I estimate the company will miss that projection by several billion dollars, especially now that Google's Gemini 3 launch has put OpenAI on a "Code Red," shortly after an internal memo revealed that Gemini 3 could “create some temporary economic headwinds for [OpenAI]." Which leads me to another question: why? Gemini 3 is "better," in the same way that every single new AI model is some indeterminate level of "better." Nano Banana Pro is, to Simon Willison, "the best available image generation model." But I can't find a clear, definitive answer as to why A) this is "so much better," B) why everybody is freaking out about Gemini 3, and C) why this would have created "headwinds" for OpenAI, headwinds so severe that it has had to rush out a model called Garlic "as soon as possible" according to The Information: Right, sure, cool, another model. Again, why is Gemini 3 so much better and making OpenAI worried about "economic headwinds"? Could this simply be a convenient excuse to cover over, as Alex Heath reported a few weeks ago, ChatGPT's slowing download and usage growth? Experts I've talked to arrived at two conclusions: I don't know about garlic or shallotpeat or whatever, but one has to wonder at some point what it is that OpenAI is doing all day: So, OpenAI's big plan is to improve ChatGPT, make the image generation better, make people like the models better, improve rankings, make it faster, and make it answer more stuff. I think it's fair to ask: what the fuck has OpenAI been doing this whole time if it isn't "make the model better" and "make people like ChatGPT more"? I guess the company shoved Sora 2 out the door — which is already off the top 30 free Android apps in the US and at 17 on the US free iPhone apps rankings as of writing this sentence after everybody freaked out about it hitting number one. All that attention, and for what? Indeed, signs seem to be pointing towards reduced demand for these services. As The Information reported a few days ago... Microsoft, of course, disputed this, and said... Well, I don't think Microsoft has any problems selling compute to OpenAI — which paid it $8.67 billion just for inference between January and September — as I doubt there is any "sales team" having to sell compute to OpenAI. But I also want to be clear that Microsoft added a word: "aggregate." The Information never used that word, and indeed nobody seems to have bothered to ask what "aggregate" means. I do, however, know that Microsoft has had trouble selling stuff. As I reported a few months ago, in August 2025 Redmond only had 8 million active paying licenses for Microsoft 365 Copilot out of the more-than-440 million people paying for Microsoft 365. In fact, here's a rundown of how well AI is going for Microsoft: Yet things are getting weird. Remember that OpenAI-NVIDIA deal? The supposedly "sealed" one where NVIDIA would invest $100 billion in OpenAI, with each tranche of $10 billion gated behind a gigawatt of compute? The one that never really seemed to have any fundament to it, but people reported as closed anyway? Well, per NVIDIA's most-recent 10-Q (emphasis mine): A letter of intent "with an opportunity" means jack diddly squat. My evidence? NVIDIA's follow-up mention of its investment in Anthropic: This deal, as ever, was reported as effectively done, with NVIDIA investing $10 billion and Microsoft $5 billion, saying the word "will" as if the money had been wired, despite the "closing conditions" and the words "up to" suggesting NVIDIA hasn't really agreed how much it will really invest. A few weeks later, the Financial Times would report that Anthropic is trying to go public as early as 2026 and that Microsoft and NVIDIA's money would "form part of a funding round expected to value the group between $300bn and $350bn." For some reason, Anthropic is hailed as some sort of "efficient" competitor to OpenAI, at least based on what both The Information and Wall Street Journal have said, yet it appears to be raising and burning just as much as OpenAI. Why did a company that's allegedly “reducing costs” have to raise $13 billion in September 2025 after raising $3.5 billion in March 2025, and after raising $4 billion in November 2024? Am I really meant to read stories about Anthropic hitting break even in 2028 with a straight face? Especially as other stories say Anthropic will be cash flow positive “as soon as 2027.” And if this company is so efficient and so good with money, why does it need another $15 billion, likely only a few months after it raised $13 billion? Though I doubt the $15 billion round closes this year, if it does, it would mean that Anthropic would have raised $31.5 billion in 2025 — which is, assuming the remaining $22.5 billion comes from SoftBank, not far from the $40.8 billion OpenAI would have raised this year. In the event that SoftBank doesn't fund that money in 2025, Anthropic will have raised a little under $2 billion less ($16.5 billion) than OpenAI ($18.3 billion, consisting of $10 billion in June split between $7.5 billion from SoftBank and $2.5 billion from other investors, and an $8.3 billion round in August) this year. I think it's likely that Anthropic is just as disastrous a business as OpenAI, and I'm genuinely surprised that nobody has done the simple maths here, though at this point I think we're in the era of "not thinking too hard because when you do so everything feels crazy.” Which is why I'm about to think harder than ever! I feel like I'm asked multiple times a day both how and when the bubble will burst, and the truth is that it could be weeks or months or another year, because so little of this is based on actual, real stuff. While our markets are supported by NVIDIA's eternal growth engine, said growth engine isn't supported by revenues or real growth or really much of anything beyond vibes. As a result, it's hard to say exactly what the catalyst might be, or indeed what the bubble bursting might look like. Today, I'm going to sit down and give you the scenarios — the systemic shocks — that would potentially start the unravelling of this era, as well as explain what a bubble bursting might actually look like, both for private and public companies. This is the spiritual successor to August's AI Bubble 2027, except I'm going to have a little more fun and write out a few scenarios that range from likely to possible, and try and give you an enjoyable romp through the potential apocalypses waiting for us in 2026.

When people started experimenting with digital representations of real-world assets years ago, they eventually came to realize that the technology has little bearing on the ability to sell investments quickly, with minimal loss in value, he told Decrypt in an interview. “Providing liquidity to the asset class is as important as providing accessibility,” he said. “And there was a perception that tokenization was going to make those illiquid assets liquid, and that didn’t happen, because an illiquid asset is illiquid whether you tokenize it or not.” Whether it’s an ownership stake in an apartment building or a tokenized Pokémon card, Domingo said that a digital asset will inherit the illiquidity of its physical counterpart. That means assets could remain difficult to sell immediately without incurring significant losses. Domingo said the dynamic could eventually shift as the technology around tokenization develops, but in the meantime, people are focusing primarily on assets where existing liquidity can be amplified, namely cash and U.S. Treasuries. “We’ve gone in the opposite direction [of illiquid markets], where arguably the most successful tokenized asset is actually the dollar,” he said, pointing to the rise of stablecoins. Stablecoins, which are often backed by a combination of cash and government debt, are a $300 billion corner of the crypto market, according to RWA.xyz. Meanwhile, tokenized U.S. Treasuries dwarf tokenized stocks, at around $9 billion and $681 million, respectively. At present, Securitize is among several players taking tokenization to Wall Street, after helping issue BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (or BUIDL). The money market fund, which exists across several blockchains, has become a $2 billion product since its debut last March. In an article published in The Economist on Monday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein highlighted tokenization’s potential to “greatly expand the world of investable assets.” They described the technology’s adoption as notable in emerging markets. Asset classes like real estate are dominated by large institutions today, but the financial giant’s most senior executives posited that “smaller, more accessible units” could broaden access.

On November 10th, Tiffany Hsiao rejoined Matthews Asia after leaving the firm in August 2020 to join Artisan Partners to launch a China-focused private fund. Prior to her departure, Tiffany managed the firm’s China Small Companies, former Asia Small Companies (now Emerging Markets Small Companies), and Asia Innovators strategies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the way for Dimensional Fund Advisors to launch an exchange-traded fund share class on 13 of its existing mutual funds (see the November Commentary for the 13 funds) on November 17th. On or about January 28, 2026, CrossingBridge Pre-Merger SPAC ETF will change its name and its investment objective. The new name will be CrossingBridge Ultra-Short Duration ETF with a new investment objective to offer a higher yield than cash instruments while maintaining a low duration. The current ETF advisers allow that “the investor base interested in a very narrow pre-merger SPAC arbitrage strategy has diminished and the cost to acquire new potential clients is high.” First impressions aside, the Pre-Merger SPAC ETF is a low volatility strategy (maximum lifetime drawdown of 0.4%, annualized returns of 5.3%), which is consistent with CrossingBridge’s corporate ethos: “Return of capital is more important than return on capital. CrossingBridge seeks high current income and capital appreciation consistent with the preservation of capital.” Five of their six older funds have earned MFO’s Great Owl designation for having consistently top quintile risk-adjusted returns over all trailing measurement periods; the seventh fund, Nordic High Income, is fascinating but too young to qualify. Brown Advisory International Value Select ETF is in registration. Expenses have not been stated. Brown Advisory LLC serves as the investment adviser. FPA Queens Road Value ETF is in registration with the intent of reorganizing FPA Queens Road Value Fund into an ETF. Expenses have not been stated. Steve Scruggs, CFA, will remain the portfolio manager and has served as the portfolio manager of the predecessor fund. T Rowe Price has announced four new active fixed income exchange-traded funds: T. Rowe Price Short Municipal Income ETF (TMNS), T. Rowe Price Long Municipal Income ETF (TMNL), T. Rowe Price High Income Municipal ETF (THYM, Snowball begins humming about parsley, sage, rosemary, and …), and the T. Rowe Price Multi-Sector Income ETF (TMSF). Vanguard has launched three new actively managed ETFs: Vanguard Wellington U.S. Growth Active ETF (VUSG), Vanguard Wellington Dividend Growth Active ETF (VDIG), and Vanguard Wellington U.S. Value Active ETF (VUSV). VUSV’s strategy and management are similar to the Wellington Management portion of the Windsor Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.30%. VUSG’s strategy and management are similar to the Wellington Management portion of the Vanguard Global Equity Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.35%. VDIG is managed by the same team that is responsible for the Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund, with an expense ratio of 0.40%. Clearbridge Small Cap Growth fund is reopening to new investors on December 1st. The fund has been soft-closed since October 2013. Vanguard has trimmed its fees on its Primecap Funds: Additionally, Vanguard has eliminated its longstanding fee agreement with Primecap. Primecap will be paid a base fee plus (when it exceeds its benchmark) or minus (when it underperforms its benchmark). Previously, PRIMECAP was paid a simple, asset-based fee: a set percentage of each fund’s assets, billed quarterly. Bumpkus. DoubleLine Floating Rate Fund and DoubleLine Select Income Fund will, pending shareholder approval, be subject to a “Plan of Reorganization and Termination” through which they’ll become American Beacon funds on February 6, 2026. In each case, the change will involve stapling the words “American Beacon” to the front of the current name. If shareholders approve, the $23 million Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund is expected to reorganize into the $1.5 billion Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on or about May 8, 2026. If they don’t approve, their fund will be liquidated and the orphans cast out into the street. Laffer | Tengler Equity Income ETF will be reorganized into the Wedbush LAFFER|TENGLER New Era Value ETF. abrdn Bloomberg Industrial Metals Strategy K-1 Free ETF will liquidate on or about December 5, 2025. Fascinating factsheet: the fund has $23,214,433.06 in assets – presumably for about a 12-second window, has been in operation since 9/23/2021, and seems to have returned 0.43% since inception. The Acclivity Mid Cap Multi-Style Fund has closed and will discontinue its operations effective December 22, 2025. AB Sustainable US Thematic Portfolio will be variously terminated, liquidated, and dissolved on or about January 16, 2026.

BlackRock U.S. Insights Long/Short Equity Fund will close to new and subsequent investments on December 31, 2025, in anticipation of a January 30, 2026, liquidation. City National Rochdale U.S. Core Equity Fund will be liquidated on December 22, 2025. Decent fund with nearly $200 million in assets, but it appears that it lost a single large shareholder recently, with assets dropping by $199.46 million (per Morningstar) all at once. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF (BTFX) will be dissolved on December 16, 2025. Apparently, the advisor wasn’t able to find enough adrenaline junkies who wanted to take a ride in a vehicle twice as volatile as Bitcoin itself. How volatile? Ummm … on 10/6/2025, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC) hit $55.96/share. Six weeks later, it visited $36.42, a 35% drawdown. Year to date, BTC has lost 4% and BTFX has booked a 37% loss. Conestoga Mid Cap Fund will be liquidated on or about January 31, 2026. Cromwell Balanced Fund (formerly Cromwell Sustainable Balanced Fund) terminated the public offering of its shares and discontinued its operations on November 17, 2025. The microscopic DailyDelta Q100 Upside Option Strategy ETF, which pursues short-term upside bets on the NASDAQ 100, and its evil twin DailyDelta Q100 Downside Option Strategy ETF, both disappear on or about December 8, 2025, after just eight months of operation despite high nominal returns for QUP and correspondingly large losses for QDWN. Following the resignation of Raymond James as the fund’s subadviser, the FT Raymond James Multicap Growth Equity ETF will be liquidated on January 16, 2026.

State Street Nuveen Municipal Bond ESG ETF, State Street SPDR S&P SmallCap 600 ESG ETF, State Street SPDR MSCI USA Climate Paris Aligned ETF, and State Street SPDR MarketAxess Investment Grade 400 Corporate Bond ETF are slated to undergo a singularly slow unwinding, with the funds closing on May 12, 2026, and liquidating on May 18th. Texas Capital Texas Small Cap Equity Index ETF, which promised you the opportunity to “harness the potential of small companies benefiting from the business-friendly Texas economy,” will be liquidated on or about December 15, 2025. Based on a simple comparison with Mairs & Power Small Cap, it appears that the “economic, regulatory, taxation, workforce, and other benefits” of operating in Texas might be just a little less compelling than those of operating in Minnesota. The $14 million Touchstone Climate Transition ETF (HEAT) will be liquidated on December 23, 2025, a decision attributed to the fund’s limited growth potential. The #1 and #2 holdings are NVIDIA and Facebook / Alphabet, dubious champions of the climate transition. Sanford C. Bernstein Emerging Markets Portfolio will be reorganized into an ETF through a merger with the AB Emerging Markets Opportunities ETF. While Bernstein is the investment adviser for both the fund and the ETF, the ETF is managed by a different portfolio team, one that employs an integrated approach that combines both fundamental and quantitative research to identify attractive investment opportunities to manage risk. The acquisition “is expected to be consummated on or about January 23, 2026.” (That sounds creepily like the description of some feudal lord’s wedding night, by the way.” Sterling Capital Short Duration Bond and Sterling Capital Ultra Short Bond Funds will be reorganized into the Sterling Capital Short Duration Bond ETF and Sterling Capital Ultra Short Bond ETF, respectively. The reorganizations are expected to occur on or about March 30, 2026. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Just when it looks as if the wheat was being sorted out from the chaff and one thinks Division 1A the form lines are possibly becoming set in Division 1A, along comes a weekend threat shreds such notions. The tone of round 8 had been set on Friday night when UCD defied form and expectations with a rip-roaring 43-38 win over Lansdowne on the Aviva Stadium back pitch, and that surprising tone rippled into Lakelands Park on Saturday when Young Munster stormed into a 29-0 lead against Terenure College before withstanding a late comeback for an overdue second win of the season. UCD had lost a week previously by 36-12 in Old Belvedere and after their summer exodus again fielded a team with no player older than 23. But they roared into a 28-17 interval lead after Max Doyle opened the scoring, Daniel Hurley struck twice, and Thomas Quinn added a crucial first-half stoppage-time try for the students before they capitalised on another hanging restart by Paddy Clancy for Evan Moynihan to score at the start of the second half. Even so, Lansdowne stayed in contention through tries by Bobby Sheehan, Jack Matthews, Greg McGrath and Harry Van Eaden before James Kenny’s score put them 38-36 ahead inside the last ten minutes. Whereupon, UCD’s Under-20 hooker Matthew Furlong, on debut, gathered an overthrow and followed up his own long punt with a tap tackle in the lead up to centre Ben Brownlee scoring under the posts. “I’m very proud of the fight shown by the boys after a week when we showed a great reaction to what had been a poor performance,” said head coach Emmet MacMahon. “It was a wild game but we managed to score different types of tries, which is always very pleasing.” In many respects, Young Munster were due a significant win after so many near misses. Terenure won the toss and elected to play into the wind, as Munsters would have done, but the home side were pinned in their own half as the Cookies built a 22-0 lead and had their fifth attacking bonus point by the interval through tries by Shay McCarthy (two), Luke McCready and the prolific Sligo winger Hubert Gilvarry – his ninth try in eight games. A penalty try after the break put them 29-0 lead, and two tries from Aran Egan and another from Caspar Gabriel, who converted twice, was not enough for ‘Nure to extract anything from the game, as Lansdowne’s two bonus points ultimately moved them up to third. “We definitely deserved to win and it was our most complete performance of the season,” said a relieved and happy Munsters head coach Ger Slattery. St Mary’s stayed top with a 14-0 win in Ballynahinch, Ronan Watters scoring in each half; Cork Constitution moved to fifth with a 21-15 win at Old Belvedere, Danny Sheahan scoring twice early and David Good adding a decisive 62nd minute try; while Clontarf made it seven wins in a row with a 28-12 victory at Nenagh Ormond through Alex O’Grady, Alex Usanov, Sam Owens and a penalty try.
