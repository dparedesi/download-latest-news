You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has passed its proof-of-concept phase. With over $20 billion in tokenized assets and institutional momentum from top-tier asset issuers such as Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, KKR and VanEck, among others, on-chain finance is no longer hypothetical. But the road ahead — powered by rapid infrastructure improvements and shifting market conditions — is where the real transformation begins. Here are the five key technological and five key market drivers shaping the next three years of tokenization: 1. Blockchain infrastructure maturityLayer 1s and layer 2s are scaling quickly, reducing fees and improving UX. Seamless wallet usage, account abstraction and lower gas costs will make holding tokenized assets frictionless for institutions and individuals alike. 2. Smart contract evolutionContracts are becoming safer, more composable and increasingly automated. Expect AI to assist in designing and auditing contracts that power yield, compliance and asset servicing — all with less manual oversight. 3. On-chain identity integrationWallet-linked KYC and decentralized identity protocols will streamline onboarding without sacrificing privacy, a critical breakthrough for institutional adoption and retail accessibility. 4. Institutional-grade custodyMPC wallets, recovery protocols and regulated custody options will resolve long-standing custody concerns — making tokenized assets truly investable at scale. 5. Regulated marketplaces & exchange integrationMore tokenized assets will trade on SEC-regulated ATS platforms and become available on-chain via compliant DEXs, driving liquidity and transparency across asset classes. 1. Regulatory clarityRegulators in the U.S., EU, and APAC are advancing frameworks for tokenized securities, stablecoins and DeFi. As clarity grows, so will institutional confidence. 2. Tokenized treasuries > stablecoinsTokenized T-bills (e.g. BUIDL, VBILL) are emerging as superior collateral and yield-bearing instruments — offering institutional-grade safety with better capital efficiency. 3. Stablecoins as global settlement layerWith $150B+ in circulation, stablecoins are evolving into programmable cash — enabling instant settlement, treasury funding and FX trades across blockchains. 4. Full asset class coveragePublic equities, private equity, bonds, credit, real estate and commodities are all heading on-chain. Tokenization is expanding from yield products to the full capital stack. 5. Institutional & emerging market accelerationWall Street is actively piloting tokenization infrastructure, while emerging markets are leapfrogging legacy systems by going directly to blockchain rails. Conclusion The next phase of RWA tokenization will be driven by scalability, composability and credibility. Institutions are no longer asking if they should tokenize — but how fast they can do it. The result will be a 24/7, globally accessible financial system — built on trustless rails, powered by programmable assets.

Title: SharpLink Gaming Boosts Crypto Treasury To 188,478 ETH, Becomes Largest Publicly Traded Ether Holder

Minneapolis-based sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming added over $30 million in ETH to its treasury between June 16 and June 20, cementing its position as the largest publicly traded holder of Ether globally. SharpLink acquired 12,207 ETH at an average price of $2,513, boosting its treasury holdings to 188,478 Ether, or approximately $470 million based on the crypto’s price at the time. To fund the purchase, SharpLink raised $27.7 million in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) offering, selling over 2.5 million shares. SharpLink is one of the increasing group of publicly traded companies that recently pivoted to add crypto to their corporate balance sheets, following the successful playbook of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Since the company is centered on Ethereum, it is the first Nasdaq-listed firm to adopt ETH as its core treasury reserve asset, aiming to offer shareholders exposure to the second-largest crypto by market cap. Unlike Strategy, which typically just accumulates BTC, SharpLink has put its ETH to work. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy, the company said it has staked all its crypto cache, earning 120 ETH in rewards. The firm also disclosed an ETH-per-share growth rate of roughly 19% during that period. “This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders, alike,” said SharpLink Chairman of the Board, Ethereum co-founder, and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin in a statement. ETH is up 0.5% over the past 24 hours amid a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. It is now trading at $2,419.38, which is below the average purchase price for SharpLink’s treasury buys. While SharpLink now claims the bragging right of being the biggest publicly traded holder of Ether globally, some entities are still holding more ETH. The Ethereum Foundation now holds 212,072 ETH ( valued at $514.59 million) in its treasury, data from Arkham Intelligence shows. Some crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, such as BlackRock, also hold a considerably bigger ETH stash, albeit on behalf of their clients. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF held roughly 1.7 million ETH as of June 25, worth around $4 billion.

Title: Agrochemical Giant Syngenta: Toxic Sustainability. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2025-06-25T13:28:25Z

Syngenta doesn’t sell sustainability. It sells the story of it. It’s one of the world’s largest agrochemical firms—born from the merger of Novartis and AstraZeneca’s agribusiness arms, now owned by ChemChina. It sells seeds, pesticides and promises. And increasingly, it sells itself as a climate solution. But this is not transformation. It’s rebranding. Syngenta’s model hasn’t changed. It still pushes chemical-intensive farming, proprietary hybrids and monoculture logic. What’s changed is the language: regenerative agriculture, climate smart, sustainable intensification. The poison is the same. Only the label is new. Take paraquat. A highly toxic herbicide linked to thousands of farmer poisonings and deaths across India. Banned in more than 50 countries. Still sold in India. Syngenta is one of its largest manufacturers. In 2020, India’s Ministry of Agriculture proposed banning paraquat, citing health risks and lack of antidote. But the ban never materialised. Industry lobbying, led in part by Syngenta and its affiliates, stalled the process. The company argued that paraquat was safe when used properly. Apparently, training, not prohibition, was the answer. The burden is shifted to the farmer. The chemical stays on the shelf. And the deaths continue. Syngenta now frames itself as a sustainability leader. Its corporate roadmap outlines four priorities: higher yields with lower impact, soil regeneration, rural prosperity and sustainable operations. It speaks of ‘regenerative agriculture’ and ‘nature-positive farming’. It partners with The Nature Conservancy and the World Economic Forum. But its core business remains unchanged. It still sells atrazine, banned in the EU. It still promotes hybrid seeds that require chemical support. It still pushes input-intensive models that degrade soil, reduce biodiversity and lock farmers into cycles of dependency. This is not regeneration. It’s reputation management. And it’s working. In India, Syngenta runs various corporate social responsibility programmes: rural market upgrades, solar electrification, youth training and water access. These projects are real. They improve lives. But they also serve a deeper function: to embed the company in rural communities, deflect criticism and secure social licence. A firm that sells paraquat also installs solar panels. A firm that promotes pesticide use also funds health camps. The contradiction is not resolved. It’s papered over. This is not corporate responsibility. It’s strategic philanthropy. And it’s expanding. The Green Revolution didn’t just change what farmers grew—it changed how they thought about farming. Syngenta’s model continues that legacy. It reframes farming as a chemical equation: inputs in, yields out. Syngenta’s ‘Good Growth Plan’ claims to train millions of farmers in sustainable practices. But these practices often revolve around safe pesticide use—not reducing dependency. The goal is not agroecology. It’s market expansion. And the state plays along. Syngenta partners with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) (India’s top body for agricultural research and education), state governments and international donors. It co-authors training manuals. It sits on advisory boards. It helps shape what counts as ‘best practice’. And it does so without scrutiny. It’s capture by invitation. And it narrows the future. Agroecological alternatives are framed as niche. Indigenous seeds are sidelined. Farmer-led innovation is ignored. The path forward is paved with proprietary inputs, digital compliance and climate branding. The farmer is told ‘adapt or be left behind’. Syngenta sells carbon credits, drought-tolerant hybrids and ‘climate-smart’ packages. It positions itself as part of a solution. But the solution looks a lot like the problem. The same firm that degrades soil now offers soil regeneration. The same firm that promotes monocultures now speaks of biodiversity. The same firm that lobbied against pesticide bans now funds sustainability summits. The future of food is being written by those who caused its crisis. Syngenta doesn’t just sell chemicals. It sells the idea that chemicals are inevitable. That farming without them is naïve. That sustainability means managing toxicity, not moving beyond it. But this is the enclosure of possibility—wrapped in the language of regeneration, delivered through partnerships and enforced by protocol. The agri biotech sector is engaged in a corporate hijack of agriculture while attempting to portray itself as being involved in some kind of service to humanity. A couple of years ago, Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald called for organic farming to be abandoned. He claimed rich countries had to increase their crop production—but organic farming led to lower yields. Fyrwald also called for gene editing to be at the heart of food policy in order to increase food production. He stated that people are starving due to organic agriculture. Writing on the GMWatch website, Jonathan Matthews responded by saying the conflict in Ukraine and food-related supply chain disruptions had emboldened Fyrwald’s scaremongering. In effect, Fyrwald’s comments reflected the industry’s determination to undermine the European Union’s Farm to Fork strategy, which aimed by 2030 not just to slash pesticide use by 50 per cent and fertiliser use by 20 per cent but to more than triple the percentage of EU farmland under organic management. Such goals represent an existential threat to the likes of Syngenta, which led to a carefully orchestrated attack on the EU strategy. Mathews quoted research that shows genetically engineered crops have no yield benefit and drive substantial increases in pesticide use. The newer and much-hyped gene-edited crops look set to do the same. Syngenta was among the corporations criticised by a 2017 UN report for “systematic denial of harms” and “unethical marketing tactics”. Selling highly hazardous pesticides is at the core of Syngenta’s business model. Fyrwald is far from an objective observer. He is compelled to promote corporate value capture, patents and market penetration while denigrating threats to profit margins. Bayer sells dependency, Amazon sells inevitability, Microsoft builds the stack, Gates builds the script, BlackRock governs through capital and so on. Each firm speaks a different dialect. But the grammar is the same. It is the grammar of control. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: Joe Duffy’s Liveline highlights: From scammers to Normal People and banks to menopause, this was appointment radio
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/06/25/joe-duffys-liveline-highlights-from-scammers-to-normal-people-and-banks-to-menopause-this-was-appointment-radio/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T13:07:51Z
Full Content:
Joe Duffy will host his final edition of Liveline on Friday, bringing the curtain down on one of the most popular and influential tenures in Irish radio history. Since taking over from the late Marian Finucane as presenter in 1999, Duffy has turned RTÉ Radio 1’s afternoon phone-in show into a phenomenon. Under Duffy’s stewardship, Liveline – with its famous tagline, “Talk to Joe” – could be a safe space for deeply personal stories, a chaotic small claims court and a crusading platform for social justice. As he hangs up his mic on the show, these 10 memorable moments highlight Duffy’s inimitable style, as well as his knack for capturing the public mood. An early indication of Duffy’s ability to stir listeners to action came in January 2001. Helen, a mother of autistic twins, phoned the show “in pure desperation” to describe her dire living conditions: her Wicklow house had been left unfinished by a builder who had scarpered, despite having been paid £25,000. “It’s just a nightmare,” she said, recounting how she had to cook Christmas dinner in her garage. Duffy appealed for help, the show was duly inundated with offers from tradesmen, and 101 days later, Helen – real name Catherine Doyle – was hosting both Duffy and President Mary McAleese in her newly rebuilt home. The legend of the Liveline effect was born. In hindsight, Duffy’s first decade at Liveline was wilder and more sensationalist than in later years, never more so than during the 2007 on-air barney between crime journalist Paul Williams and criminal Alan Bradley. The temperature really spiked when Duffy took a call from John Daly, an inmate at Portlaoise Prison, who accused Williams of stirring up a feud between himself and fellow Finglas native Bradley. “I can’t stay long, I’m in a cell,” said an agitated Daly. “Get off the phone you f***ing liar.” The episode prompted a clampdown on mobile phones in Irish jails. But it had a grim coda: Daly was murdered a few months after being released from prison. One of Liveline’s enduring strengths has been as a consumer watchdog, calling out shoddy customer service or – in the case of Mark Townley – serial conmen. In June 2008, Duffy heard several complaints about a Dublin-based model agency approaching teenage girls with bogus promises of a spot on an Irish version of reality show America’s Next Top Model – for a fee, naturally. Bangor native Townley, the agency’s boss, phoned in and brazenly defended his scam, while Duffy picked apart his guest’s murky past, before delivering a dramatic coup de grace: “I’m putting it to you straight now, and you can take me to the High Court on this – you are the Mark Townley that has been banned from entering England and Wales for two years.” Townley never sued: in a tragicomic twist, he was later imprisoned in England for threatening to kill Prince Harry. In September 2008, with the Celtic Tiger faltering, Liveline was flooded with calls from people anxiously withdrawing their money from banks and placing it in supposedly safer post office accounts: a postmaster spoke of queues out the door. Duffy knew reassurances from banks were falling on deaf ears: “Look at Lehman Brothers, look at Enron, Rusnak and AIB – the issue is trust,” he said, modestly adding, “I know I sound like Jimmy Stewart in It’s a Wonderful Life.” Then finance minister Brian Lenihan was so worried about Duffy’s potential to cause a run on the banks that he phoned RTÉ’s director-general Cathal Goan to complain. Days later, however, Lenihan issued the fateful bank guarantee, thus heralding Ireland’s great economic crash – something Duffy cannot be blamed for. But the host displayed his occasionally preternatural facility for taking the public pulse; as he later remarked, “The punters knew the banks were dodgy before the politicians did.” Down the years, Duffy has had many heartbreaking conversations with people suffering from grave medical conditions, from cancer patient Susie Long in the months before her passing in 2007, to the late Charlie Bird’s revelation of his motor neuron disease diagnosis in 2021. But few interviews had the immense empirical impact of Duffy’s 2009 interview with screenwriter Frank Deasy. A friend of the host, Deasy candidly spoke of his agonising wait for a liver transplant, likening it to “being on death row”. It was a sadly prophetic description: Deasy died only days later, during an operation to transplant his liver. But the effect of his brave account was spectacular. Within days, 15,000 people had applied for organ donor cards, with surely life-saving results. Once Duffy has a target in his sights, he can be relentless. This was certainly the case in 2010, when the host spearheaded a campaign against head shops selling so-called “legal highs”. For days on end, Duffy heard from people whose family members had suffered terrible effects after consuming psychoactive substances from the 100 stores across the country. One caller, Paul Hodkinson, recounted how his brother Colm died after taking magic mushrooms in 2005. Duffy’s unremitting campaign whipped up emotions, though not always to edifying effect, with pickets placed on some shops. But the public pressure yielded action. The government clamped down on the sale of legal highs, leading in turn to the closure of most head shops. A decade later, Duffy commented: “Our campaign to close down head shops was our best achievement.” Arguably Duffy’s most significant achievement, however, is his uncompromising and compassionate coverage of clerical abuse in Ireland. Following the 2009 publication of the Ryan and Murphy reports into sexual abuse in Catholic-run institutions, Duffy provided a sympathetic space for survivors to share their stories in raw, unfiltered fashion. In other hands, the deluge of abusive experiences could have been numbing, but Duffy handled the issue sensitively, with callers testifying to the traumas endured by vulnerable people in the Church’s care. Taking just one example, a caller named Maureen later recalled the harsh regime she endured in a Magdalene laundry, as well as the harrowing fate of her older brother at Artane Industrial School: “He was rented out to a bank manager for weekends.” Duffy has revisited the subject regularly ever since, whether allowing survivors to furiously decry the inadequacy of the mother and baby homes report in 2021, or, the following year, hearing how schoolboys sexually assaulted by priests at Blackrock College in the 1970s were shamed into silence by their clerical abusers: “They make you feel so ashamed, so guilty, it’s actually frightening.” In allowing survivors to find their voice, Duffy helped reveal the truth about one of Ireland’s most shameful chapters. A proud son of Ballyfermot, Duffy has never hidden his Dublin roots, given to sentimentally reminiscing with older callers about the city in the rare auld times. Equally, however, he has fulminated against the capital’s less attractive side, be it antisocial behaviour, street crime or, during an unforgettable 2015 rant, the city itself. Duffy declared Dublin “dead”, with shuttered landmark stores replaced by pound shops and fast food joints. “Dublin city centre is turning into an unadulterated kip, and nobody is shouting stop.” The possibility of such cranky outbursts ensured Liveline remained appointment radio for many throughout Duffy’s tenure. At the height of the first Covid lockdown in April 2020, between his signature pandemic-era exhortations to “washyourhands”, Duffy brought much-needed gaiety to the nation by hosting a riotous discussion on the TV series Normal People, complete with the classic Liveline elements of sex and religion. The host first heard genteel-sounding caller Mary voice her displeasure at the sexually explicit scenes in the small screen adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel. “I imagine it was like something you would expect to see in a porno movie,” Mary ventured. “What would you see in a porno movie, Mary?” replied Duffy, deploying his trademark sigh. (Mary didn’t know.) [ Normal People: Putting Sally Rooney’s novel on the small screenOpens in new window ] From there on, proceedings grew more entertainingly fractious, as a devout Christian named Tommy started railing against “fornication”, “the teaching of promiscuity” and, most unfortunately, “sluts”. The derogatory terminology aside, the captive audience was treated to a vintage episode. He can be hammy, tetchy and mawkish, as well as empathetic and engaging, but if Duffy has one defining characteristic as a broadcaster, it’s his capacity to hit upon and tease out the urgent conversations bubbling under the surface of Irish life. This was evident in May 2021 when the host spoke to Sallyanne Brady, who described the multitude of distressing effects of menopause on her health. Despite the fact that half the population will face menopause, Brady said, there was a silence on the matter: “I want a voice for these women.” Duffy soon noted that “the calls are coming in thick and fast”, and over the next two weeks women phoned in to share their experiences of menopause. Not for the first time, Duffy put a previously taboo subject firmly on the public agenda. That a male presenter should facilitate such a necessary conversation on women’s health probably says something about Irish society; but equally, Duffy was always adept at tapping into his audience’s concerns. People talked to Joe, after all. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The following content is sponsored by Monument Traders Alliance and written by Karim Rahemtulla, the head fundamental tactician at Monument Traders Alliance. Let’s be clear: Donald Trump isn’t known for backing individual companies. But if you know anything about him, you’d realize he’s an “America First” protectionist at heart. And the truth is, Trump’s latest trade war means he’ll need to protect American companies from costly tariffs. And there’s one emerging energy company he’s backing personally. It didn’t take long for me to understand why. You see, this energy group is tapping into two of the most important forces shaping Trump’s “America First” future. Those forces are: Over the past few years, the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has been everywhere. Tech stocks like NVIDIA have become a household name. ChatGPT is changing the way we gather and communicate information. Plus, America is in an arms race with China, with former President Joe Biden signing the CHIPS act in 2022 to boost domestic tech production from companies like Intel and Micron. But aside from AI, there’s another side to the story – energy. While AI is growing at a rapid rate, it’s starving for energy. A single AI model can consume as much electricity as 100 U.S. homes during its training phase – and it’s only going to get worse. Even Elon Musk has raised alarm as well – saying we’re headed for a massive shortfall in electricity production if we don’t act fast. It’s rare that two major market forces combine, but this is one of those pivotal moments. On one hand, you’ve got AI – the single biggest transformative technology of our lifetime. On the other hand, you’ve got energy – the main resource to fuel that transformation. Combine the two and you have a complete system for: When I was researching the company, I was shocked at how strong its fundamentals were: Here are a few reasons why the energy group is not a household name yet. It’s in a “boring” sector. Wall Street and retail investors have been obsessed with tech and AI over the past few years. Meanwhile, energy prices have been ignored unless prices spike. Energy companies aren’t sexy like Nvidia or Tesla. So, it’s overlooked because of its sector. COVID caused some impairments. It took some write-downs and impairments in previous years, especially during COVID when demand cratered. While the company is crushing it now, those past scars have scared investor sentiment. It recently partnered with an AI company. This company recently partnered with another tech giant to squeeze more energy out of the ground, and more profitably and efficiently. But that partnership is still in its early stages, and investors haven’t caught on yet. When a President starts defending a company in the headlines, it means something big is brewing. And when a foreign government recently tried to pass a new tax to interfere with the group’s operations overseas, Trump stepped in with a fiery statement – directly calling out the move and telling them to reverse course. The fundamentals on this company are also the strongest I’ve seen in years, and since most investors haven’t caught on yet, I believe it’s still undervalued right now.

Title: BNY Eyes $3 Trillion Powerhouse With Northern Trust Deal

More is displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, showcasing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's real-time financial trends, stock price movements, market fluctuations, and developments in the global financial services and investment management sectors, on April 6, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) The custodial banking behemoth Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is considering a possible acquisition of Northern Trust, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. So, will a deal actually occur? Not at the moment. The CEOs of both companies have had discussions, but there has yet to be a formal proposal. A spokesperson for Northern Trust also stated that the company prefers to remain independent. However, should the two firms join forces, there are numerous potential advantages due to their significant presence in the asset-servicing arena; thus, the opportunity isn’t entirely closed, particularly if BNY presents a persuasive proposal. So why would this deal be advantageous for BNY? For BNY, the rationale is quite straightforward: larger scale, increased influence, and substantial cost efficiencies. Both companies provide comparable services such as asset protection, trade settlement, cash management, and wealth as well as asset management services. Merging with Northern Trust would produce an investment services powerhouse. BNY currently oversees $53 trillion in assets under custody, ranking as the world’s largest custodial bank. Collaborating with Northern Trust’s clientele and capabilities would significantly enhance the strength of the combined organization. The merged entity would control over $3 trillion in assets under management, enabling it to compete with asset-management titans like BlackRock and Vanguard. Additionally, there’s an efficiency component to consider. The merger could yield considerable cost synergies primarily through the consolidation of technological platforms, reducing overall workforce numbers, and minimizing redundant real estate holdings. Under the leadership of CEO Robin Vince, who has implemented a turnaround strategy that has boosted the company’s stock by almost 50% within the last year, BNY appears well-positioned to pursue this course. Furthermore, BNY’s financial performance has recently exceeded expectations. related: Is Neobank Chime Stock A Buy? Initially, Northern Trust must consent to a sale. After the initial report surfaced, the company asserted its commitment to remaining independent. Then there’s the matter of regulation. While the Trump administration is perceived as more welcoming to substantial mergers in the financial services sector, especially following the recent approval of the Discover-Capital One merger, BNY is recognized as a globally systemic bank, which may invite additional regulatory scrutiny. The leading positions of both companies in the custodian and asset servicing domains could also trigger antitrust issues. Shares of Bank of New York experienced a fall of about 2% during Monday’s trading session, suggesting that investors might not be entirely convinced about a potential deal. Investing in a singular stock involves inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 during the past 4 years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, demonstrating less volatility as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.

These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “TITAN1” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “TITAN2,” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

June 25, 2025 02:01 ET | Source: InfraPartners, LLC InfraPartners, LLC London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The research team unveils the new Upgradeable Data CenterTM in its first white paper London and Houston, Texas, June 25, 2025 - InfraPartners, a leader in prefabricated AI data center solutions, today announced the launch of a new research function, InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering. Led by recent hire Bal Aujla, previously the Global Head of Innovation Labs at BlackRock, InfraPartners has assembled a team of experts based in Europe and the US to act as a go-to resource for AI innovation in the data center industry. The function will foster industry collaboration to provide forward-looking insights and thought leadership. Innovating the future of data centers AI demand is driving a surge in new global data center builds which are projected to triple by 2030. AI-specific infrastructure is expected to drive approximately 70% of this growth. Additionally, regulation, regionalization, and geopolitical shifts are reshaping infrastructure needs. As a result, operators are looking at new ways to meet these changes with solutions that deliver scale, schedule certainty, and accelerated time-to-value while improving sustainability and avoiding technology obsolescence. InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering will accelerate data center innovation by identifying and focusing on the biggest opportunities and challenges of this next wave of AI-driven growth. With plans for Gigawatts (GWs) of data center builds globally and projected investments reaching nearly $7 trillion, the impact of new innovation will be significant. Through partnerships with industry experts, regulators, and disruptive newcomers, the InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering team aims to foster a community where ideas and research can be shared to grow data center knowledge, capabilities, and opportunities. These efforts will aim to advance the digital infrastructure sector as a whole. “At InfraPartners, our new research function represents the deliberate convergence of expertise from across the AI and data center ecosystem. We’re bringing together professionals with diverse perspectives and backgrounds in artificial intelligence, data center architecture, power infrastructure, and capital allocation to address the evolving needs of AI and the significant value it can bring to the world” said Bal Aujla, Director, Head of Advanced Research and Engineering, InfraPartners. “This integrated team approach enables us to look at opportunities and challenges from end-to-end and across every layer of the stack. We’re no longer approaching digital infrastructure as a siloed engineering challenge. Instead, the new team will focus on the initiatives that have the most impact on transforming data center architecture and creating business value.” Ensuring access to the right insights As AI innovation and GPU roadmaps outpace traditional data center lifecycles and significantly change the design of sites, operators need access to insights and approaches which enable them to keep pace with rapid industry change. InfraPartners’ Advanced Research and Engineering team will support this by enabling the industry to build smarter, more adaptable infrastructure and improving outcomes for all stakeholders. A new approach to data center architecture: introducing the Upgradeable Data Center™ InfraPartners Advanced Research and Engineering has developed a new design philosophy that prioritizes flexibility, upgradeability, and rapid refresh cycles. Called the Upgradeable Data Center™, this design future-proofs data center investments and enables greater resilience and sustainability in a fast-changing digital landscape. “The Upgradeable Data Center™ reflects the fact data centers must now be built to evolve. In a world where GPU generations shift every 12–18 months and designs change significantly each time, it is no longer viable to build static infrastructure which has decade-long refresh cycles. Our design approach enables operators to deploy the latest GPUs and upgrade data center infrastructure in a seamless way” said Harqs Singh, Chief Technology Officer at InfraPartners. In its first white paper, ‘Data Centers Transforming at the pace of Technology change’, the team explores the rapid growth of AI workloads and its impact on digital infrastructure, including the thought-provoking GPU technology roadmap, increasing rack densities, and the implications for the modern data center. It highlights the economic risks and commercial opportunities emerging from these trends and introduces how the Upgradeable Data Center™ is enabling new data centers to transform at the pace of technology change. InfraPartners' model is to build 80% of the data center offsite and 20% onsite, helping address key industry challenges like skilled labor shortages and power constraints, whilst aligning infrastructure investment with business agility and long-term growth. About InfraPartners: InfraPartners is a global leader in digital infrastructure, delivering turnkey prefabricated data center solutions for AI workloads. The company’s standardized design process and offsite manufacturing offers greater schedule and cost certainty, plus rigorous quality control. With a core focus on sustainability and innovation, InfraPartners collaborates with hyperscalers, GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) providers, and government entities focused on sovereign AI to design and deploy scalable, energy-efficient data centers.

Title: Leaving Cert grinds industry: ‘Salaries scales for the top teachers can be 100 to 250 grand’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/06/25/leaving-cert-grinds-industry-salaries-for-the-top-teachers-are-100-to-250-grand/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
The final Leaving Cert exams are over – but another competition has been raging among grind schools where top teachers have been snapped for eye-watering salaries. The race is for a slice of a grinds industry estimated to be worth up to €60-80 million. Grinds360 is the newest competitor on the market, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. It describes itself as a “hybrid” service, combining an app which streams weekly grinds across 20 subjects, a Netflix-style catalogue of video lessons as well as in-person workshops at certain times of year. The cost, which has varied since its launch almost a year ago, is currently €1,399 a year. The company started out by poaching several teachers from rivals such as the Institute of Education and the smaller Dublin Academy of Education on huge salaries for the sector. The circumstances of one those cases – maths teacher Rob Browne, who left the Dublin Academy of Education to work for Grinds360 – was at the centre of a High Court row last September, which was subsequently struck out. Brendan Kavanagh, chairman and co-founder of Grinds360, says the firm started out hiring teachers from its competitors for key subjects like maths, English, Irish, sciences and business. The going rate to attract some of the top talen from its rivals initially was, he says, “anywhere from 100 to 250 grand”. “Are they worth 200 grand or 250 grand? For the hours they had to work – they were working six, seven days a week in day school and night school – I’d want that kind of money – especially for teaching!” Kavanagh laughs. At the online platform, he says, they are able to work fewer hours but play key roles in developing the future of the company. “It’s not really apples for apples. The more experienced grinds teachers are able to add a lot of value as we train other teachers throughout the country [who are now working for the company].” Some, he says, were also attracted by the idea of becoming involved in ownership of the firm. “If you earn that kind of money, you pay a lot of tax. So I think the opportunity for them to become stakeholders in the business ... created a new sort of environment there.” Subsequent teachers have been hired part-time, on different contracts, from various schools in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Roscommon. The result, he maintains, is that the company is making grinds “accessible and affordable” for students, while disrupting the “superstar teacher” narrative which he says has been pushed by some grind schools. “I’m off a few Christmas Card lists and I’ve been referred to as the Michael O’Leary of grinds. I’ll take it if making overpriced, over-glorified education finally compete on fairness, access, and transparency earns me that comparison,” he says. Nearly one year on from launch, Kavanagh says Grinds360 has seen “explosive growth” with more than 3,000 paying members and 18,000 app users. Backed by a €3.2 million seed round, he says the company is set to “double revenue” in 2025-2026 and claims the company has established itself as the “go-to alternative to traditional grind schools”. “The numbers speak for themselves – there’s a real hunger for a new model of academic support,” he says. Yet, business is also booming at the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street, which itself was a disruptive force in the education sector 57 years ago when it started the trend for exam-focused tuition. The institute was sold to a UK-based schools group, Dukes Education, in 2023 for just under €135 million. This year, the institute is forecasting a record enrolment of 1,700 full-time students in September across fourth, fifth and sixth year, with students paying annual fees of up to €11,000 a year. It also runs grinds, crash courses and online learning for up to 10,000 students attending other schools. Yvonne O’Toole says demand is growing not just for exam results but because students have “moved on” from single-sex, religious schools and uniforms by the time they are in senior cycle. While it lost some teachers to Grinds360, she says “crazy salaries” are not the norm, but that teachers are paid well on the basis that they are “expected to go above and beyond”. “They do a lot more hours ... there are extra classes – morning, evening – and they’re expected to be available. They put their heart and soul into it.” The institute’s main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It had about 350 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students last year and says it is on course to grow to 400 when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock in September. It expects numbers to grow to 500 in 2027 when it launches a fourth year offering. Founder Chris Lauder says while it also lost some teachers to Grinds360, it has “a deep squad” and was able to “march on”. The academy, he says, is always looking for top teaching talent. “What we used to do was ask our students if they knew of great teachers and surveyed them. Teachers also know other great teachers. And, these days, you also find them on social media,” he says. He questions whether some of the top salaries being mentioned are sustainable for the sector and insists the best teachers ultimately want to teach students in-person rather than online. “We pay more than what the public sector has to offer, and in some cases a lot more – maybe 50 per cent more,” he says. “Our teachers want to work for not just for remuneration; they like teaching students who are serious about academics. This is senior cycle only. They’re young adults, not children. They are driven – and they are a joy to teach.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Carl O'Brien is Education Editor of The Irish Times.

Title: Why did the US Army commission four technocrats as high-ranking military officers?

Four technocrats who are closely affiliated with Meta, Palantir, and OpenAI were just commissioned into the U.S. Army as lieutenant colonels, which I find to be extremely odd, and seriously concerning. Here’s the story, from a report at Task & Purpose: Four senior executives of tech giants like Meta and Palantir are being sworn into the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers at the unusually high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a new program to recruit private-sector experts to speed up tech adoption. For context, these Silicon Valley executives just skipped the entire enlisted rank structure (12 ascending positions), and four officer ranks, and jumped right to O-5. And, here are the four names: The Reserve’s new lieutenant colonels are Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer for Palantir; Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta; Kevin Weil, chief product officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former chief research officer for OpenAI. Since my mind immediately goes to scandal and conspiracy when I see the federal government cozying up to Big Tech (I’m engrossed in the news every day, can you blame me?), I quizzed a military friend trying to understand any reason why this might not be the nightmare it seems, wondering if I were overlooking or missing something. His conclusion was logical and simple: the only reason people are commissioned into the military is because they want to work within the military framework. I asked if it was because maybe their civilian status precludes them from being involved in sensitive tasks or missions? He replied no, noting that civilian consultants are a normal thing in the military, and then referenced Hillary Clinton who “never served a day in her life” but held a Top Secret SCI until very recently, when President Trump revoked it. And, these four men aren’t going to be officers in the traditional sense, as they’re exempt from standard military requirements: As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won’t need to complete the Army Fitness Test. So, why are top executives in Big Tech joining the military? Especially alarming is that all three tech firms, largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard, are known for being enemies to liberty and freedom. (I wrote on a disturbing development regarding Palantir here.) At least two of these technocrats are World Economic Forum elites—and now they’re leaders in our military? Is Sankar just a surrogate for Palantir’s Alex Karp? This doesn’t sit right with me at all. Image from Grok.

The initial public offer of HDB Financial Services Ltd, a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, received 37 per cent subscription on the first day of bidding on Wednesday. The initial share sale got bids for 4,85,98,380 shares against 13,04,42,855 shares on offer, as per NSE data. The category for non-institutional investors attracted 76 per cent subscription while the quota for Retail Individual Investors (RIIs) got subscribed 30 per cent. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) quota got subscribed 1 per cent. HDB Financial Services mopped up Rs 3,369 crore from anchor investors. The Rs 12,500-crore initial public offering (IPO) will conclude on June 27. The price band for the offer has been fixed at Rs 700-740 per share. At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at nearly Rs 61,400 crore. The IPO is a combination of a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs 2,500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 10,000 crore by the promoter, HDFC Bank. At present, HDFC Bank owns a 94.36 per cent stake in HDB Financial Services, a non-banking financial company (NBFC) arm of the bank. The company proposes to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue to strengthen its Tier-I capital base. This will support future capital needs, including additional lending, to support business growth. The HDB Financial IPO is the second biggest in the last three years after South Korean automaker Hyundai’s Rs 27,000-crore offer. JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, IIFL Capital Services, Jefferies India, Morgan Stanley India Company, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Nuvama Wealth Management, and UBS Securities India are managing the company’s IPO. The company’s shares are expected to be listed on the BSE and NSE on July 2.

Total: 0.31 times (BSE data as at 3.54 pm) The credit growth of NBFCs which has trended above India’s GDP growth historically, is expected to continue to rise at a faster pace. NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network. Investors looking to invest can invest in the IPO for the long term. - Master Capital Services Ltd With scalable operations, granular customer acquisition, diversified funding, and expanding fee-based revenues, HDB is expected to sustain its growth momentum, outperform the sector, and continue delivering healthy, sustainable returns. We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months. SMIFS Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%. We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services. - Deven Choksey Research Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective. - BP WEALTH HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.28 times (BSE data as at 3.03 pm) HDBFS, a fast-growing subsidiary of HDFC Bank, is set for a ₹12,500cr IPO with a valuation of ~₹61,253cr at 3.9x P/B basis FY25 book value. Its strong presence in semi-urban and underbanked markets, diversified and expanding loan portfolio, advanced digital capabilities, and robust financial performance underscore its compelling long-term investment potential. - Aditya Birla Money Backed by strong parentage, AAA-rated credit profile, and an expanding footprint, A C Choksi Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. says HDB is positioned to leverage growth in underserved segments. However, challenges around rising NPAs, elevated credit costs, and subdued ROEs remain near-term watchpoints. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.24 times as at 2.21 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.24 times (BSE data as at 2.21 pm) Valuation: The company is valued at an FY25 P/B of 3.2x/3.4x at post\u0002issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively. The company is backed by strong parentage, brand, governance, risk management and a high credit rating. It is one of the largest NBFCs catering to the 2 nd largest customer franchise. The company is well placed to register healthy growth going ahead, while witnessing an improvement in the asset quality. SBI Securities recommend investors SUBSCRIBE to the issue at the cut-off price. At the upper end of the price band, HDB is valued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.01x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.72x. This places it above peers like L&amp;T Finance and Mahindra Finance, and in line with Sundaram Finance and Cholamandalam, but below the premium commanded by Bajaj Finance. - Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk • Further stake sale by parent HDFC Bank can be overhang on the stock price: The parent HDFC Bank may have to decrease its holding from 74.2% (post-issue @ UB) to less than 20% in a span of 2 years, according to the draft circular by the RBI, which was issued on 4th October 24. • Asset quality risk: The company’s Gross Stage 3 Loans accounted for 2.3% of the gross loans as of Mar’25, which may adversely affect the company’s financials in case of non-payment or default. • Unsecured loan risk: Unsecured loans accounted for 27.0% of the company’s gross loans as of Mar’25. • Liquidity risk: Any asset-liability mismatch may cause liquidity concerns affecting the results of operations and financial condition • Regulatory risk: The NBFC industry is highly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, and any adverse regulations or any failure to comply with a regulation may have an adverse impact on the business. - SBI Securities All IT stocks traded in green, led by Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Infosys. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. Among the defence index, Dynamatic Technologies and Cyient DLM traded with 1-3 per cent gains, while Data Patterns, GRSE, Paras Defence, BEL and Mazagon Dock depreciated 2-4 per cent.

HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.20 times as at 1.27 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.20 times (BSE data as at 1.27 pm) We believe HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in one of India’s leading and fastest-growing diversified NBFCs, with a well-balanced loan portfolio across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand. Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective. Mehta Equities HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.17 times (BSE data as at 12.42 pm) We compare HDB with Bajaj Finance and also with other vehicle, MSME, Consumer financiers like Chola, M&M Finance, Shriram Finance and L&T Finance. HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlook Nirmal Bang Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion? The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said. His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business. Report by Piyush Shukla of businessline | Read more HDB Financial Services, an IPO-bound NBFC, operates independently from HDFC Bank, with an upcoming IPO on June 25. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.14 times as at 12.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.14 times (BSE data as at 12.03 pm) HDB’s IPO crystallises three critical trends in Indian finance. First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps. Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come At upper price band, IPO is priced at 3.2x FY25 P/BV post capital raise (V/s its close peer Chola Fin-5.5x) with 2.2% ROA. We recommend SUBSCRIBE for long term. Key risk: Regulatory overhang on overlap of business activities with the parent. - IDBI Capital The ₹12,500 crore HDB Financial Services IPO marks a pivotal moment for India’s NBFC sector – not just as the largest NBFC debut to date, but as a test case for how public markets value diversified lenders in an era of tightening regulations and evolving credit demand. Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.12 times as at 11.36 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.12 times (BSE data as at 11.36 am) We recommend to subscribe this IPO with long term view, as With its robust brand, varied loan portfolio, and wide distribution network, the company which is supported by HDFC Bank offers a great chance. With a focus on digital infrastructure and underbanked segments, it is well-positioned for long-term growth. Considering the company’s constant growth in its headline numbers and the recent rate cut by the RBI will improve liquidity and reduces borrowing costs, which will benefits the company. - Kunvarji Wealth Solutions JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, IIFL Securities, Jefferies India, Morgan Stanley India Company, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Nuvama Wealth Management, and UBS Securities India are managing the company’s IPO. HDB Financial Services, a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, has garnered Rs 3,369 crore from anchor investors, according to an update on the exchange. The anchor round saw participation from a host of investors such as domestic mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign entities, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website on Tuesday. Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI MF, Nippon India MF, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, BlackRock, Royal Bank of Canada, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, APG Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, and Goldman Sachs have participated in the anchor round. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, British multinational Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, and Tata Investment Corporation, among others, have also been allotted shares in the anchor round. According to the circular, HDB Financial Services has allotted over 4.55 crore equity shares to 141 entities at Rs 740 per equity share, which is the upper end of the IPO price band, aggregating the transaction size to Rs 3,368.99 crore. Of the total equity share allocation to the anchor investors, the company has allocated nearly 1.94 crore shares to 22 domestic mutual funds that have applied for the public issue through 65 schemes, the circular said. PTI “HDB Financial Services Ltd. is India’s second largest and third-fastestgrowing NBFC franchise, serving 19.2 million customers as of March 31, 2025, with a CAGR of 25.45% over two years. Its growth is supported by financial inclusion initiatives, and it offers 13 lending products across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance, tailored by loan type, customer profile, tenure, and interest rate. They have built a pan-India hybrid presence, comprising over 1,771 physical branches across more than 1,170 towns and cities in 31 States and Union Territories as of March 31, 2025, supported by a digitally enabled distribution network through both in-house and third-party channels. They intend to further diversify their funding sources by expanding and strengthening their lender base, with the goal of optimising leverage and reducing the average cost of borrowings. At the upper price band, the company’s FY25 price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 3.7x, with a post-issue market capitalization of ₹6,13,879.4 million. Backed by the strong parentage of HDFC Bank, India’s second largest private bank by total assets, the company offers a well-diversified product portfolio with robust granularity, scale, and sound lending quality. We consider the IPO fairly valued and recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating.” Anand Rathi HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.08 times as at 10.48 am on June 25, 2025.

Additionally, favourable macro environment will act as tailwind for the sector in the near to medium term. We expect healthy listing gains and remain assertive from a medium to long-term perspective.” ❑ Asset Quality: High exposure to unsecured loans and MSMEs increases the risk of defaults, especially during economic stress. ❑ Geographic Concentration: Over 80% of branches are in semi-urban/rural areas, which may be more vulnerable to economic or monsoon-related disruptions. ❑ Liquidity & Interest Rate Risk: As an NBFC, HDB relies on borrowed funds. Tightening liquidity or rising interest rates could impact margins and loan growth. ❑ Regulatory Risk: RBI’s evolving norms for NBFCs could affect operations, compliance costs, and capital requirements. ❑ Competition: Intense competition from banks, fintechs, and other NBFCs may pressure yields and affect credit quality. ❑ Limited Transparency: Being unlisted, HDB provides less public disclosure than listed peers, limiting investor visibility HDB Financial Services IPO has been subscribed 0.04 times as at 10.18 am on June 25, its opening day. The NII portion has been booked 0.07 times, retail 0.05 times, employee portion 0.29 times and reserved for shareholders 0.07 times. QIBs were NIL.

Arisinfra Solutions stock rose 1.55% on the NSE to ₹208.18 as at 10.09 am after listing at ₹205, a 7.65% discount from the IPO price of ₹222. Valuation: HFSL is the seventh largest leading, diversified retail-focused NBFC in India in terms of the size of total gross loan. The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25. Additionally, the NIM has been under pressure and remains lower compared to peers. The declining ROE and PCR further underscore operational concerns. Although the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by its strong brand and expanding customer base, considering the near-term operational challenges, we recommend a “Subscribe For Long Term” rating for this issue -Choice Broking India’s largest NBFC public issue, HDB Financial Services, will hit the primary market today at a price band ₹700-740 a share.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs record $1B inflows in 15 trading days, hitting $4B for the first time

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.3 billion of gross inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the US crossed $4 billion in cumulative net inflows on June 23, only eleven months after their market debut. The products launched on July 23, 2024, and required 216 US trading sessions to accumulate their first $3 billion by May 30. Following the $3 billion mark, spot Ethereum ETFs added the next $1 billion in just 15 trading days, lifting lifetime net subscriptions to $4.01 billion by the close of June 23. Those 15 sessions represent 6.5% of the 231-day trading history but account for 25% of all cash committed so far. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.31 billion of gross inflows, while Fidelity’s FETH contributed $1.65 billion and Bitwise’s ETHW added $346 million. Grayscale’s legacy ETHE trust, which converted to an ETF at launch, recorded $4.28 billion in outflows over the same period. Daily flow data show the inflection. ETHA absorbed more than $160 million on June 11 alone, and the complex booked five separate days above $100 million between May 30 and June 23. Grayscale’s redemptions slowed during the same window, allowing aggregate flows to turn sharply higher. ETHA and FETH charge 0.25% management fees, matching the sector median and undercutting ETHE’s 2.5% rate. Lower costs, combined with established primary-market relationships, continue to steer inflows toward BlackRock and Fidelity, according to a CoinShares report that spoke with brokers who allocate on behalf of wealth managers. The report highlighted three factors as drivers for the June surge. The first is a rebound in ETH’s price relative to Bitcoin, coinciding with the Internal Revenue Service’s more explicit guidance on staking income within grantor-trust ETFs. Lastly, larger rebalancing orders from multi-asset allocators, treating ETH as a portfolio extension rather than a standalone speculative bet, contributed to the surge in inflows. The next quarterly Form 13F deadline in mid-July will reveal whether professional managers joined the late-spring push. Through March 31, those firms accounted for less than 33% of spot Ethereum ETF assets, suggesting room for broader institutional uptake even as retail flows concentrate on low-fee vehicles.

Title: Principal of school in Blackrock, Dublin, given further 16 months for indecent assault charges
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/06/24/principal-of-school-in-blackrock-dublin-given-further-16-months-for-indecent-assault-charges/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T17:20:00Z
Full Content:
A former school principal jailed for indecently assaulting two students has been told he will spend a further 16 months in prison for indecently assaulting another four boys. Aidan Clohessy (85) was jailed for four years on Monday for indecently assaulting two boys in the 1980s. He was convicted of 19 counts of indecent assault in relation to six boys following two separate trials at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last month. On Tuesday, Judge Martin Nolan imposed sentence in relation to the second trial, in which Clohessy was convicted of five counts of indecently assaulting four boys. Two of these counts of indecent assault related to one boy, with one count each in relation to the other three boys. All of these offences took place between 1969 and 1986. Clohessy was acquitted of three further counts of indecent assault. After hearing facts on Monday, Judge Nolan adjourned the case overnight to consider sentence and the defence’s submission in relation to the totality principle. Judge Nolan said the indecent assaults were “undoubtedly very serious” for the injured parties, noting that many of the incidents described were “obviously physical chastisement as well”. He said the aggravating features included that Clohessy was in a position of trust which he betrayed. The judge also noted that the injured parties were vulnerable and said Clohessy “took advantage of their vulnerability”. He said there was some “small mitigation”, including Clohessy’s age. Judge Nolan said if this was a stand-alone trial, and Clohessy was younger, he would impose a sentence of between three and four years. But, the judge said the court had to take into account the totality principle and that Clohessy is already serving a sentence. He imposed a 16-month sentence, which is to run consecutive to the four-year sentence imposed on Monday. This means Clohessy has received a sentence of five years and four months for his offending against the six injured parties. A member of the Order of St John of God, Clohessy was the principal of St Augustine’s School, Blackrock, Co Dublin, from the early 1970s until 1993, when he was appointed to lead a mission in Malawi. Clohessy, with an address at the Hospitaller Order of St John of God, Granada, Stillorgan, Co Dublin, voluntarily returned to Ireland in 2013. The six boys were all pupils of the school. Some were boarders at the school, which catered for boys with mild to moderate learning disability at that time. The injured parties were aged between 10 and 13 when Clohessy’s offending took place. The abuse primarily took the form of inappropriate touching, the court heard. In the first trial, Clohessy was convicted of 14 counts of indecent assault – 10 in relation to one boy and four in relation to a second boy on dates between 1983 and 1985. The court heard that some of the complainants had no objection to being identified.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/06/24/these-3-big-dividends-just-got-cut-theyre-safer-than-ever/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T16:17:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Global liquidity and BTC’s resilience could fuel continued uptrend. Bitcoin [BTC] continued to show resilience as Global Liquidity climbed to $140 trillion, nearly reclaiming all-time highs. The move came as the U.S. dollar weakened, and the MOVE Index dipped, boosting overall liquidity in risk markets. This uptick was not random—weekly liquidity grew by $0.46 trillion, a 0.33% increase, as confirmed by Alpha Extract. That surge helped reinforce the current macro support for Bitcoin’s bullish bias. The 3-month Rate of Change (RoC) stayed elevated, backing the thesis that Bitcoin’s $78,000 breakout wasn’t just noise. Historically, a rising 3-month RoC aligns with bull market territory and risk-on appetite. In fact, the RoC’s trend has been consistent since the initial breakout and continues to support the uptrend even as geopolitical risks shift. Source: Alpha Extract Due to the de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and Iran, fear-related volatility was diminished. Oddly enough, a direct war could have spurred liquidity via emergency spending. However, markets now lean toward reduced uncertainty, favoring slow-and-steady growth over chaos. This lowered volatility backdrop is ideal for assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on confidence and consistent capital flows. Following the powerful resilience exhibited by Bitcoin, the whale activity and institutional inflows increased. A whale made a withdrawal of 163 BTC from Binance worth $17.16 million, but this was just a part of a bigger transfer. The same whale withdrew 2,263 BTC, or $235.02 million in total. Of that, 2,100 BTC was sent straight to cold storage. In fact, it was this vigorous hoarding that indicated an increase in the confidence of Bitcoin as a long-term trend and a determined course in self-custody. Moreover, according to Trader to The Fund’s latest ETF flow data, Bitcoin ETFs saw $350.48 million in Net Inflows, marking the 10th straight day of green. BlackRock was on top with IBIT raising a total of $217.65 million, and Fidelity followed with $105.66 million Source: Trader to The Fund/X Healthy participation was found even in smaller funds. Even though Grayscale had a small outflow amount of $5.69 million, mini funds had a positive $10.06 million gain. Overall, the sustained demand from both majors and minors confirms that institutional appetite remains firm in this liquidity-rich phase. On the 15-minute chart, BTC jumped past $105,000, liquidating short positions en masse. A strong bullish candle supported a high-paced move of the price up to $105,112, after initially standing at a distance of $103,697. Meanwhile, CVD dropped to -10.438K, confirming that aggressive short-selling failed to hold the line. At the same time, Open Interest (OI) fell to 289.18K from 290.84K. This indicated liquidation of short positions rather than fresh long entries—a classic wipeout as bears got squeezed. Source: TradingView As OI declined while prices continued rising, it became clear that short positions were being liquidated in real time, fueling even more momentum for the ongoing bull market.

Title: New BlackRock ETF Signals A Strong Focus On The Texas Economy

ByDavid Blackmon ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. BlackRock chairman and CEO US Larry Fink gestures as he addresses the audience, during the annual ... More meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Alpine resort of Davos on January 24, 2025. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) The Texas state government made big news a few years back when it invoked sanctions on big institutional investor BlackRock, claiming the firm’s ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) based investing strategies unfairly discriminated against the state’s oil and gas energy sector. The sanctions were invoked related to a state law passed in 2021, during the height of the ESG investment boom. But that movement has faded rapidly over the past year as oil and gas corporations have refocused their capital allocation strategies away from low carbon projects, which shareholders have noticed also largely proved to be low profit endeavors. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has adjusted as well, removing the term “ESG” from his internal and external communications and tailoring BlackRock’s investment strategies to reflect current trends. Most recently, Blackrock has made significant moves to re-engage in the Texas marketplace. Bloomberg reported in late March that Fink’s firm had filed to establish a Texas-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would invest in companies headquartered in the Lone Star State. On Tuesday, BlackRock launched the iShares Texas Equity ETF (NASDAQ: TEXN) to be based off the Russell Texas Equity Index, which is designed to reflect the performance of Russell 3000 companies with Texas headquarters. “TEXN presents a new opportunity for Texans, and investors across the country, to invest in nearly 200 companies powering the state’s economy and to capitalize on Texas’ twin engines of business and population growth,” said Joe DeVico, Head of the Americas Client Business at BlackRock. Despite its controversies with the state’s government, BlackRock was one of the founding investors in the nascent Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE). With current plans to launch operations in 2026, TXSE has taken in over $120 million in capital from investors like BlackRock and Citadel, who see the state and its massive economy as a major growth engine for the future. TXSE plans to function as a national securities exchange and is banking on being able to obtain application approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the end of 2025. In response to BlackRock’s filing for its Texas-focused ETF, James H. Lee, Chairman and CEO of the Texas Stock Exchange, posted about it on LinkedIn: “BlackRock’s plan to create a Texas ETF is a masterclass move that puts it at the forefront of two key trends. The first is the momentum behind the Texas Miracle. We’re seeing the same demand to invest in and grow Texas businesses, especially since our state is already home to more than one in 10 U.S. public companies. The second key trend is the rapidly expanding market for ETPs, which is projected to grow to more than $25 trillion over the next decade.” Lee added that he was "excited that the world's largest institutional investor is making another bold strategic move in our great state.” So, despite the dustups with state officials of the recent past, BlackRock maintains a large and growing presence in Texas. According to BlackRock’s Texas state spotlight, they have over $379 billion invested in Texas public companies, $134.6 billion invested in state energy, and over $14 billion invested in Texas municipal bonds on behalf of clients. In fact, BlackRock today stands one of the largest investors in Texas oil and gas. For Fink and his management team, the motivations for such a robust presence in the state are obvious. Investing in Texas, as TEXN will promote, not only strengthens the state’s energy infrastructure but also aligns with and advances America’s rapidly evolving national energy policy objectives. Texas is the nation’s largest energy producer, accounting for 41% of national crude oil and 25% of natural gas production. The state also leads the country in both wind and solar power generation capacity, making up about 28% of U.S. wind-powered electricity. Regardless of anyone’s personal views about the various forms of generation, all investors must recognize that grid infrastructure like transmission lines and upgrades, battery storage systems, and weatherization of critical facilities require constant injections of new capital. These rising levels of investment are crucial for maintaining grid stability and accommodating renewable energy sources and baseload generation from natural gas, coal and nuclear alike. For Texas’s nation-leading suite of wind and solar installations, programs like the federal government’s $7 billion investment in the Solar for All program, including nearly $406 million for Texas, and the Renewable Energy Electric Generation (REEG) program in Texas, which has attracted approximately $62 billion in investments, provide major injections of such capital. The same is true of the state’s natural gas generation sector, which is again embarked on a growth path as power generators strive to meet Texas’s rapidly expanding electricity demand in the coming years. In essentially every possible way, Texas stands as a pivotal player in the U.S. energy landscape. There is no question the state must be able to attract major, strategic investments to maintain and further bolster its leadership in energy production, grid reliability, and clean energy transition. BlackRock continues to invest heavily in local industries, including energy, infrastructure, and real estate because Texas offers what few other states can: low taxes, light regulation, a booming population, and thriving energy and tech sectors. In the end, while political drama may dominate headlines, economic and energy reality drives investment decisions. Texas remains a place where business still comes first, and BlackRock, through its investment in the TXSE and establishment of its Texas-focused ETF, appears committed to both Texas and financial returns in its continuation of doing business in the state.

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s 8% rebound – Will Q3 push ETH to $3K?

Time Published: 2025-06-24T12:00:56Z

Caught between conviction and caution, Ethereum tests a key supply wall. After nearly two weeks of relentless selling pressure on Ethereum [ETH], a sharp 8.27% green candle has emerged, at press time, clawing back nearly 21% of those losses in just one move. On closer look, this resembles a textbook “reset and rebound” setup, where a cooldown offered patient investors a shot at discounted supply, especially with macro FUD starting to ease off. Yet, the line between a relief rally and a breakout could be razor-thin. According to AMBCrypto, which side Ethereum lands on may well dictate its directional bias heading into Q3. Yet again, Ethereum’s two-week decline has been noticeably steeper than [BTC], with ETH shedding 26% from its $2,878 mid-June peak, more than double BTC’s 10.89% drop. And this wasn’t just a fluke. While Bitcoin showed relative resilience, Ethereum’s Short-Term Holder (STH) NUPL plunged into the capitulation zone right as ETH broke below the $2.5k mark, after nearly a month of tightly range-bound trading around that level. This was further confirmed by a surge in realized losses, suggesting that STHs began unwinding their positions in weakness. Now, with ETH climbing back toward that same $2.5k zone, these holders may view the rally as a break-even escape, right as Ethereum re-enters a high-density cost basis cluster, as highlighted by the chart below. Source: Glassnode The yellow and orange bands highlight where most Ethereum holders bought their supply, clustering heavily around this zone. Numerous entries sat specifically in the $2.4k to $2.6k range, making it one of the most crowded and critical areas to watch as ETH approaches resistance. If ETH pushes through this band with strength, it could clear the way for further upside. But if weak hands step in to exit at breakeven, it could turn into a near-term ceiling. As Ethereum climbs into a key cost basis cluster, whether holders stay confident in a continued move higher could shape how Q3 plays out. Despite a solid run through Q1 and Q2, ETH still hasn’t managed to reclaim the $3k level, a psychological barrier that might push some investors to sell early, especially with macro risks still lingering. That’s why the recent $100 million in ETF inflows feels encouraging, as it shows fresh capital is still flowing in. Pair that with a 9.3% jump in Open Interest and a 61% long bias on Binance ETH perps, and clearly, the market’s leaning bullish. Source: CoinGlass But is this conviction? Or are we looking at blind optimism, a setup for another volatility-driven shakeout just as ETH nears resistance? Well, BlackRock’s recent $18.4 million sell-off adds a layer of caution. Smart money seems to be dialing back, too. So, unless Ethereum can break through that $2.4k– $2.6k supply wall with strength, the idea of a clean run to $3k in Q3 might be a stretch for now.

Title: Investment Firm Waltz Secures $25M Line of Credit

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy In a sign that U.S. real estate investment remains a safe harbor for foreigners, investment company Waltz announced Tuesday that it has secured a $25 million line of credit, bringing its total debt and equity funding to $50 million. Setpoint Capital provided the new funding to support Miami-based Waltz’s up to $1 billion in loan volume capability for foreign investors looking to invest in U.S. residential real estate. “The demand is growing,” said Yuval Golan, founder and CEO of Waltz, which plans to use the new funding to expand into Latin America and meet some of that demand. “What we see in the market, even though there’s some uncertainty, is that foreigners keep investing and being very bullish on America right now, especially the sophisticated investors. A lot of demand is from countries that are seeing some macro political issues.” The line of credit is intended to originate additional U.S. mortgage loans for foreign buyers through its digital platform, which will support Waltz’s official launch across Central and South America, with a focus on Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina — the first three being the region’s largest sources of U.S. real estate investment. Data shows that Latin American buyers make up 29 percent of international investors in U.S. residential real estate purchases of existing property sales, not including new developments. In addition, Golan is seeing investor interest from Canada, Cuba, Israel, Russia and Ukraine. “We don’t use our equity funds to lend,” said Golan. “We use a warehouse line that we can recycle, so then we can lend more and more. How does this work? Let’s say I have a line of credit of $25 million and at any given moment I have $25 million to lend. I originate the loan, then we sell that loan to Apollo or Acra Lending, one of our other secondary market players. They pay us back the principal plus the premium, and then I can redeploy the capital to use that again. Let’s say I sell to them every week. That means that I can recycle the $25 million times 52, and I use this money to turn it into a billion. “These are premium buyers that understand what they’re doing, and people believe in the U.S. economy,” said Golan of his international clients. “And that’s the time to raise and boost up the demand. There’s a lot of new construction coming up in the next few years. Post-COVID, things got a bit delayed, but now they’re coming back and inventory is back up.” Waltz’s end-to-end digital platform allows foreign investors to quickly and easily form an LLC, open a U.S. bank account, exchange currencies, secure financing, and close on property purchases. It launched in July 2024 and has processed more than $300 million in loan applications on four continents, with 15 to 20 percent of clients being U.S.-based high-credit borrowers, according to Waltz. The company uses its AI-enhanced technology across its platform, including onboarding, underwriting, processing, and selling loans to Wall Street institutions including Acra Lending, a subsidiary of HPS acquired by BlackRock; and Atlas SP, which is backed by Apollo. “We have a lot of data on our loans,” said Golan. “Many Wall Street players are very excited about our product and are partnering up with us. We automate and use artificial intelligence more and more, so that we can sell the loans faster with a lot of data. So they’re very excited about it.” “With Waltz’s full-service approach, they are streamlining investment opportunities and making it easier for individuals across the globe to invest in income-producing residential properties in the U.S.,” said Kendall Ranjbaran, managing director of investments at Setpoint Capital. “Setpoint is proud to provide a tailored credit solution as they continue to scale.” Philip Russo can be reached at prusso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Vanguard Vs. Fidelity Index Funds: Which Is Best For Your Investments In 2025?

Time Published: 2025-06-24T11:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Vanguard and Fidelity have sufficient index fund options to fulfill simple or complex investing ... More strategies. Vanguard and Fidelity offer popular index funds with competitive expense ratios. Is one fund family better for your investment portfolio than the other? This detailed comparison of Vanguard and Fidelity index funds—covering fees, performance and selection—helps you decide. One fun fact sums up Vanguard’s investment philosophy: Under the direction of company founder John Bogle, Vanguard created the world's first index fund in 1976. Bogle's innovation gave investors convenient access to a low-cost portfolio that could be held for decades. Bogle also decided to market Vanguard funds directly to investors, bypassing brokers, and to eliminate sales loads. Both moves, unconventional in the 1970s, showed Vanguard's commitment to the individual investor's success. The move to drop sales charges has spared investors from hundreds of millions in fees over the past several decades. Today, Vanguard retains its reputation as a leader in low-cost funds and a champion of retail investors. According to Morningstar, Fidelity is the third-largest fund family after Vanguard and BlackRock in terms of U.S. market concentration. The company was formed to take over the Fidelity Fund in 1946 and launched its first index fund in 1988. Fidelity's index fund strategy emphasizes low costs and fund performance that aligns closely to the target index. Both objectives benefit index fund investors by minimizing dilution of underlying investment returns. Below are head-to-head comparisons for Vanguard and Fidelity on expense ratios, fund selection, fund performance and minimum investment requirements. Vanguard expense ratios on index funds with investment minimums of $3,000 or less range from 0.03% to 0.2%. Per author calculations, the average expense ratio is 0.07%, which equates to $7 annually for every $10,000 invested. Fidelity expense ratios across 82 index funds for retail investors range from 0% to 0.4%. The average is 0.12%, per author calculations. This translates to $12 annually per $10,000 invested. Vanguard has the lower average expense ratio, but Fidelity offers a selection of zero-expense funds. Also, Fidelity’s S&P 500 fund, FXAIX, has lower expenses than Vanguard's S&P 500 portfolios. FXIAX charges 0.015%, while Vanguard's VOO ETF and VFAIX fund charge 0.03% and 0.04%, respectively. Both companies beat broader expense ratio averages. A Morningstar report concludes that the average fees for passively managed funds in 2023 was 0.55%. Vanguard has more index funds with low investment minimums than Fidelity, but both families cover these popular market segments: Cryptocurrency is one point of differentiation and Fidelity has the edge. Fidelity has funds stocked with bitcoin (FBTC) and ethereum (FETH). Vanguard does not offer crypto funds. Performance comparisons for index funds can be tricky because the underlying index is primarily responsible for defining the portfolio. So, the comparison is most telling when two funds are targeting the same index. In that case, sampling methods and trading efficiency can introduce a higher-than-necessary tracking error—causing one fund to underperform. The table below compares returns for S&P 500 funds and U.S. bond market funds from both families. Fidelity performed slightly better on the S&P 500 fund and in the one-year period for the bond fund. Lower expense ratios on the two Fidelity mutual funds contribute to the outperformance. More generalized comparisons can be made between funds that offer similar exposures but rely on different target indexes. The index gets most of the credit for outperformance, particularly when both compared funds have low tracking errors. Even so, the fund family can take responsibility for choosing the stronger index. This table compares Vanguard and Fidelity funds with similar strategies, implemented through different target indexes. You can see the performance gaps are larger vs. the prior comparison. The Vanguard index funds mostly outperformed here, despite Fidelity’s funds having lower expense ratios. Both Vanguard and Fidelity have at least 80 index funds with a $0 or $1 investment minimum. These are predominantly exchange-traded funds. Vanguard additionally has about 50 mutual funds with a $3,000 minimum investment. Both Vanguard and Fidelity are appropriate for beginner investors. Those who plan to own only an S&P 500 fund and a bond fund might earn slightly higher returns with Fidelity, thanks to the ultra-low expense ratios. On the other hand, Vanguard’s website and fund research tools are somewhat easier to navigate than Fidelity's. Fortunately, choosing one fund family doesn't mean you give up access to the other. If you are trading in a Vanguard brokerage account, you may pay extra fees to buy Fidelity mutual funds and vice versa. You can avoid the fees by purchasing ETFs instead or by opening a new account with the other fund family. Morningstar is a leading researcher of mutual funds and fund families. The company's Fund Family Digest summarizes research and ratings on the 150 largest fund families in the U.S. According to the 2024 Fund Family Digest, Vanguard is the largest fund family with $8.5 trillion in U.S. assets under management (AUM). Fidelity is ranked third with $2.95 trillion in AUM. Vanguard also has the highest Parent Rating by Morningstar Manager Research analysts. Only 10 fund families earn this rating, based on manager tenure, risk management, performance, fees and other factors. Additionally, 99% of Vanguard’s assets are in share classes with Gold, Silver or Bronze Medalist Ratings. Morningstar analysts assign these ratings to funds that are expected to outperform their category index after fees. Fidelity's parent rating is Above Average and 95% of its assets are in funds with Gold, Silver or Bronze Medalist Ratings. Vanguard and Fidelity have sufficient index fund options to fulfill simple or complex investing strategies. Fidelity does have cryptocurrency funds, which may be an advantage if bitcoin or ethereum exposure is part of your allocation plan. Vanguard has more assets under management and slightly higher Morningstar ratings, implying a more stable fund management team and better performance potential. Bottom Line You can implement many passive investment portfolios with Vanguard or Fidelity. To choose the right family, review Vanguard.com and Fidelity.com. See if one brand speaks to you over the other. If not, identify which exposures you'll invest in first, such as the S&P 500 or all U.S. stocks. Compare your options across the two families and select the one with lower tracking errors. That hopefully keeps much of the underlying investment returns flowing into your net worth.

Title: Mumbai Airport Operator Secures $1 Billion Financing for Upgrades

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Credit: Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, India Chhatrapati Shivaji Internatonal Airport, Mumbai, India / David Wong Adani landing two big funding deals back-to-back says a lot about how easily the group can tap into global money. And it’s happening just as India’s trying to catch up on airport infrastructure. Select a question above or ask something else Indian airport operator Adani Airport Holdings has raised $1 billion to support the growth and improvement of Mumbai International Airport. The funding comes just weeks after the airport company secured $750 million from a group of global banks to upgrade six other airports across India. Adani Airport Holdings manages seven Indian airports and is the country's largest airport infrastructure company, accounting for 25% of passenger footfalls and 33% of the country’s air cargo traffic. The $1 billion is a mix of a $750 million bond sale and the option to raise another $250 million later. The funds will go toward “transforming the airports infrastructure through continued investments in modernization, capacity expansion, digitization, and technology integration,” Adani said in a statement. It added that the investment will also support sustainability goals, including a target for Mumbai Airport to hit net-zero emissions by 2029. This is the first time a private company in India’s airport sector has raised money through an investment-grade bond. Adani Airport said it expects the bond to receive a BBB- rating, which is a medium-grade score. Adani Airport raised the money using a structure called “project finance,” which ties the loan directly to Mumbai Airport’s income rather than backing it with the broader Adani Group. Apollo, a US-based investment firm, led the deal, with other participants including BlackRock and Standard Chartered. Calling it the “largest private investment-grade project finance issuances,” Arun Bansal, CEO, Adani Airport, said: “With participation from Apollo-managed funds and leading institutional investors, we are proud to deepen our access to global pools of capital.” This new round of funding follows a $750 million loan Adani Airport took earlier this month from a consortium of international banks, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Barclays, and Standard Chartered. The company said the loan would support upgrades at six regional airports: Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati, and Thiruvananthapuram. Adani Airport had said it would also use the money to grow non-aviation services like retail, food and beverage, and duty-free shopping inside airports, all of which are becoming big revenue sources for airport operators. Last year, reports quoting Jugeshinder Singh, the group's chief financial officer, said Adani Enterprises is planning to list Adani Airport Holdings by fiscal 2028. Together, these two fundraising deals suggest Adani Airport is pushing ahead with its plan to modernize and expand capacity across its network. The company served 94 million passengers in the last financial year and aims to handle 300 million annually by 2040. The upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport, also managed by Adani, is being developed for $2 billion and is expected to ease congestion at the current Mumbai airport. The aim is to position the city as a global transit hub. The airport's opening has now been pushed from May this year to August. The first phase will add capacity for 20 million passengers, with eventual expansion up to 90 million. Airlines like IndiGo have already committed to flying from the new airport as soon as it opens. Low-cost carrier Akasa Air became the latest airline to partner with Adani Airport to commence flight operations. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said earlier this month that the Navi Mumbai airport will connect to 14 international destinations at launch. India is now the world’s third-largest aviation market, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). India’s 174 million passengers in 2024 accounted for 4.2% of global air traffic. IATA projects India’s annual passenger traffic to triple by 2044, reaching 425 million journeys per year. The airports in Mumbai, along with the upcoming Jewar airport in Delhi, will help cater to the growing demand for air travel in the country.

Title: The best new restaurants and cafes to open in Ireland in the past year
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/06/24/the-best-new-restaurants-and-cafes-to-try-this-year/
Time Published: 2025-06-24T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s all change in Barna where chef Nathan Hindmarch has a brand new diningroom to showcase his talents. With a menu inspired by the elements of land, sea and fire, a new open flame set-up works wonders in dishes such as black sole on the bone or dry-aged rib-eye with ramson capers. Long-serving sommelier Fergal Guiney is always happy to guide you through the wine list. Joanne Cronin With a bright open room, big windows for people watching and outdoor seating for fine days, Caribou has already established itself as a fun spot in the middle of town for bar food that’s a cut above. Its steak frites with Irish rump steak and peppercorn sauce or double smash burger bring in the weekday lunch crowd, while hearty roast lunches with unlimited gravy fill the seats at weekends. JC Peking duck at China Tang – €88 for a whole duck, ordered in advance – arrives gleaming and carved tableside by Mr Chan. The skin is brittle and amber – the first bite cracks, melts and disappears. Warm house-made pancakes, dark hoisin, sharp scallions and cool cucumber build the rest. The second course – wok-fried duck with cumin – is darker, crispier, and just as essential. Pricey, yes – but it is one of the best ducks you will eat in Dublin. Corinna Hardgrave Cush recently relocated from the seaside village of Ballycotton to the busy town of Midleton, where Dan Guerin’s cooking remains as sharp and welcoming as ever. A strong focus on locally caught seafood remains at the heart of Cush, with John Dory, roast monkfish and smoked haddock all showcased on the menu. But fear not carnivores, there’s also hearty dry-aged beef chop roasted over charcoal or pork shoulder and mozzarella croquettes. JC A cool Australian coffee vibe in Liscannor. Elaine Slattery’s coffee shop offers a small, well-executed menu with daily baked goods such as brownies, cookies and scones, plus sandwiches made with local ingredients. Headed by coffee expert Richard Mattey, it’s a laid-back spot with a retractable roof, ideal for sunny afternoons or sheltered seating, and an upstairs studio for yoga and Pilates. CH Toulouse out front, La Rochelle in the kitchen – this narrow Ranelagh bistro from Colin Dapot and Sidjy Batista turns out deft French classics. Raclette-stuffed croquettes, pork in mustard sauce with buttery spaetzle, and a fish gratin show up on the short dinner menu from Wednesday to Sunday. By day, it’s a deli for coffee, croissants and charcuterie – with a smart wine list and retail bottles available with €10 corkage. CH Classic French bistro cooking arrived firmly in Dublin to great acclaim, courtesy of industry stalwarts John and Sandy Wyer. Located over M O’Brien’s pub, the L-shaped diningroom is home to a menu packed with Gallic delights. Start with home-made saucisson or seasonally perfect asparagus with cockles followed by chicken au vin jaune or steak frites with pepper sauce. Make sure, though, to leave room for the croissant pudding with Calvados caramel. JC Dublin’s north inner city received a huge boost with the arrival of Joe Smith’s cooking, tucked inside the revitalised Juno pub. The menu is packed with good value downright tasty plates, influenced by Mediterranean flavours. Scoop up smoked cod taramasalata with home-made crisps, crunch through aubergine schnitzel or share a luxurious fish pie for two. Enjoy with one of their excellent cocktails or craft beers. JC Soup hot enough to scald your soul, dumplings fat enough to need a strategy, and French toast that should come with a defibrillator. Hong Kong Wonton is the Pau family’s 16-seater tribute to proper Hong Kong fast food: blisteringly fresh pork and prawn wontons, beef brisket falling apart into spiced broth, and deep-fried peanut butter sandwiches soaked in syrup. It’s a cha chaan teng (Hong Kong diner) drop-kicked into Dublin, serving serious food without apology. CH From former Locks restaurant to new kid on the block, Lena’s transition has been utterly seamless. The old bar is gone, replaced with a sleek new counter, the diningroom is better than ever and the menu is packed with chef Paul McNamara’s unmissable Italian dishes. Sourdough toast with melting lardo, the peppery pici cacio e pepe and the rich veal shin osso bucco will have you coming back for more. JC A Hong Kong native, chef Ben Wong came to Ireland at age 15 and now calls himself a proud Corkman. At Nosh 19, his menu is inspired by Hong Kong cha chaan teng cafe culture, mixing classic Irish-Chinese favourites with authentic Hong Kong and Asian dishes. Recent seafood showcase nights have been a hit, as are dishes like the roast duck noodle soup, Sichuan sour fish and Hong Kong ice milk tea. JC Reggie White could have stayed the guy who fixed everyone else’s pizza. Instead, he built the best one in Dublin – a sharp, low-waste pizzeria set in a reworked redbrick building in Rathmines. Behind a front window rattling with a 1981 Diosna mixer, he’s turning 48-hour fermented Wildfarmed sourdough into blistered, nutty bases topped with whey-braised leeks, Cashel Blue, and Andarl Farm sausage. CH Tucked above Conway’s Bar in Blackrock, Sea Shanty is in a creaky-floored room where dinner drifts between anchovies sharpened with ponzu, grilled octopus on smoky muhammara, green curry and oysters straight from Woopstown, Cooley, and Killough Bay, and battered seaweed bhajis. Uruguayan chef Sebastian Sainz and Spanish sommelier Elena Segura run the floor like it’s their front room, pouring serious natural wines to match the tide of sardine tins, tacos and tentacles. CH Jalisco and Oaxaca meet in Ranelagh as chefs Victor Lara and Celina Altamirano combine to bring elevated Mexican food to Dublin. Dishes such as Michelada oysters, tostada de ceviche, birria tacos with consomé and incredible charcoal grilled steak would not be out of place in Mexico City itself. It goes without saying that the cocktails made with imported tequila and mezcal are superb. JC The Bucks Head still looks like a Mournes hiking pub from the outside – pint, crisps, dog asleep under the table. Inside, Alex Greene (formerly of Michelin-starred Eipic, Pétrus, Claridge’s), and co-owner Bronagh McCormick are turning out Kilkeel scallops with beurre blanc, black crab and pork ravioli, and a black garlic bread-and-butter pudding that’s worth the drive alone. It’s serious cooking without the ego – a village inn where you can have steak and chips or savour some of the best sauces in Northern Ireland. CH Following a recent hiatus, the Pig’s Ear is back with a menu that is an ode to Irish literature and art. In other hands this would be twee, even touristy, but under owner Stephen McAllister the results are elevated and confident. Indulgent Dublin Lawyer omelette features whiskey flambéed lobster and Béarnaise sauce, holding true to its origin story of being “as rich as a Dublin lawyer”. JC Two restored carriages from the Orient Express, Leona (1927) and Linda (1954), at Glenlo Abbey, set the stage for a dining experience led by Angelo Vagiotis (Terre, Noma, Manresa) and pastry chef Linda Sergidou. The tasting menu combines exceptional technique with creativity: from organic leaves tied in a bouquet to Jerusalem artichoke paired with monkfish liver, and turbot in brioche butter with Champagne sauce. The pastry? Some of the best you’ll find. It’s clear – this is Michelin-level ambition, and one to watch. CH With summer on the way, Two Pups could not have picked a better time to launch its new evening food and wine offering. And while the name may be tongue-in-cheek, there is absolutely nothing pretentious about Adam Kelly’s food. It’s all bang on trend and beautifully executed, ranging from whipped cod’s roe on grilled sourdough and asparagus in Parmesan sauce and guanciale to chunky ham hock croquettes. Oh, and there’s wine now too. JC Vada is a daytime cafe that has livened up Stoneybatter with creative and fun dishes. Chef Hannah O’Donnell maintains a zero waste philosophy as she serves up breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. The Vada hash goes a step beyond with Ethersons gammon steak and asparagus, while the croissant French toast is for those with a sweet tooth. Look out for pop-up dinners with natural wines over the summer months. JC The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
