Crypto’s traditional four-year cycle could come to an end because of President Trump’s executive order, according to Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a new note to investors, Hougan says that the four-year cycle appeared to be intact – until Trump came out with the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order. The executive order directs the United States government to promote stablecoins, end regulatory persecution of digital assets, the evaluation of a national crypto reserve, and other initiatives. The four-year cycle is based on the idea that crypto follows Bitcoin’s halvings when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. While the four-year cycle is widely accepted as the norm by many crypto investors, Hougan says that the pattern might now be broken due to the implications of Trump’s executive orders, the implications of which could take years to play out. “The thing I’m wrestling with is that the downstream positive effects of the EO, plus the other changes in Washington, will be felt over the course of years, not months. In the absolute best-case scenario, it will take a year to align on and implement a new regulatory framework for crypto. It will take longer than that for the behemoths on Wall Street to fully orient themselves to crypto’s possibilities. If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new “crypto winter” in 2026? Will investors go into hibernation even though they know we’ve entered a new crypto-enabled world? If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback? My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis. But my guess is that any pullback will be shorter and shallower than in years past. Why? The crypto space has matured; there’s a greater variety of buyers and more value-oriented investors than ever before. I expect volatility, but I’m not sure I’d bet against crypto in 2026. As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/29/robinhood-ceo-warns-lack-of-u-s-regulation-stifles-security-tokenization-efforts

Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. "The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind," Tenev wrote. "It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century." However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to "rapidly approve" tokenization of stocks and bonds.

William Dudley, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Chris LaCivita, a political consultant and co-manager of Trump’s 2024 campaign, are joining Coinbase’s global advisory council, the company said in a press release. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democratic Arizona senator—who once proposed eliminating taxes on crypto transactions under $50—will also be joining the council, Coinbase said. What’s more, Allen & Co. Managing Director Luis Alberto Moreno, who serves on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum (WEF), will round out the group, Coinbase added. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad told Decrypt in a statement that the four new members represent “some of the brightest minds across finance, tech, and politics,” who will help guide Coinbase’s direction as “the world enters a new era for crypto.” Under the Biden administration, Coinbase faced heavy scrutiny from the SEC, which alleged that America’s leading crypto exchange violated agency rules in a now-frozen lawsuit. With Trump’s SEC apparently taking a crypto-friendlier bent with plans to bring about a sense of regulatory clarity, it appears Coinbase is taking on power players to advance its vision. “I believe we’ve reached a pivotal moment in crypto’s evolution,” Dudley, the former Fed policymaker, said in a statement. “Coinbase can ensure it is integrated into our financial system in a safe and beneficial way for Americans.” In 2018, as president of the New York Fed, Dudley warned that the “speculative mania around cryptocurrencies” was dangerous because of his perceived lack of underlying value, per the Wall Street Journal. While Bitcoin’s beginnings are rooted in a skepticism of the existing financial system—Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, embedded a message referencing bank bailouts in Bitcoin’s first block—Coinbase has embraced the industry’s ascent into the mainstream, working with companies who view blockchain as a natural evolution of financial markets. Coinbase first inked a partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in 2022. While BlackRock CEO Larry Fink continues to promote Bitcoin, he’s also talked extensively about the benefits associated with the tokenization of securities. Following a recent trip to Davos, where the WEF holds its annual meeting, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a post on X that the exchange will work with corporate leaders, from banks to asset managers, as investments accelerate into crypto. “We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone,” he wrote. "They need an institutional-grade partner like Coinbase, who can build relentlessly through the winters, to feel confident getting into crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Czech Central Bank To Vote On €7 Billion Bitcoin Investment On Thursday
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/czech-central-bank-vote-7-billion-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T16:30:13Z
Full Content:
The Czech National Bank (CNB) is poised to decide on Thursday whether to allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion in foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin, an amount totaling roughly €7 billion (roughly $7.31 billion). Governor Aleš Michl revealed the plan in an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, underlining a bold departure from the traditional asset strategies usually favored by major central banks. Michl, who previously worked as an investment fund manager, expressed his conviction that introducing BTC into the CNB’s portfolio could serve as a viable way to diversify holdings. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” he told the FT. He acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s “extreme volatility” and limited track record but pointed to rising institutional interest since global asset managers like BlackRock launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last year. Should the board approve the plan, the CNB could direct as much as 5% of its reserves—equivalent to approximately €7 billion—into Bitcoin. “Five percent [of our assets] is a lot of money, even for the Bitcoin market,” Michl noted, underscoring the potential impact of a sizable BTC purchase by a sovereign authority. Most central banks around the world have steered clear of BTC, preferring “safer” instruments such as highly rated government bonds. A few have ventured into equities, but public disclosures of Bitcoin holdings by these institutions (except for El Salvador) remain virtually nonexistent. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell confirmed in December that the US central bank does not hold Bitcoin, while comparing it to gold, describing it as a virtual and digital speculative asset. Other top monetary officials in Europe have been notoriously critical. The governor of the Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, likened Bitcoin to “digital tulips,” referencing the 17th-century speculative bubble. European Central Bank (ECB) officials have similarly argued that the “fair value of Bitcoin is still zero.” However, Michl struck a distinctly different tone. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker, I would say, I like profitability,” he told the FT. He also suggested more central banks might follow suit within the next five years, citing how some pension funds and commercial banks have begun holding BTC in their portfolios. Michl acknowledges the gamble: “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” Yet he also drew attention to the historical examples of failed corporate investments, such as Enron and Wirecard, arguing that underperformance is an inherent risk of portfolio management. Internal CNB calculations suggest that if the central bank had held 5% of its foreign reserves in BTC over the past decade, its annual returns would have increased by 3.5%—albeit with double the volatility. “But I’m saying that my goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good [for that], then let’s have it,” Michl remarked. In the interview, Michl referenced US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused executives in Washington. Last week, Trump issued an executive order to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling further discussions about crypto at the highest levels of government. While the Bitcoin proposal has captured headlines, the CNB already stands out for its relatively adventurous investment policy; 22% of its foreign exchange reserves are in equities—well above the norm for a central bank. Michl intends to increase US stock holdings to 50% of that equity portfolio within three years, up from the current 30%. “We are buying gradually and in very small steps because the [US stock] prices are the highest in history,” he explained. Whether the CNB board ultimately endorses Michl’s proposal to venture into BTC remains to be seen. If approved, the Czech National Bank could become the first major Western central bank to publicly hold crypto, setting a precedent that might inspire others—or serve as a cautionary tale. The CNB’s board meeting is scheduled for Thursday, with a final vote on the governor’s Bitcoin proposal expected shortly thereafter. At press time, BTC traded at $102,817.

Title: Institutions Are Primed for MicroStrategy's Preferred Stock Sale, Say Analysts

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). To say that MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been at the lead of creatively raising capital with which to buy massive amounts of bitcoin (BTC) would be an understatement. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company this week opened a new front along those lines with its perpetual preferred stock offering (STRK). Preferred stock sits between equity and debt on the corporate balance sheet, offering investors the regular return of bonds while giving them an ownership stake in a company. Well-followed MicroStrategy analyst Ben Werkman, posted on X about the attraction preferred stock can offer institutional investors due to its lack of maturity risk, stable yield and optional equity upside. "I could see a scenario where [the preferred stock] starts taking some of the convertible bond space for fixed income accumulation due to the lack of any point in time maturity risk," said Werkman. "Preferred stock has the potential to be massively more accretive than any convertible offering has been and definitely more accretive than [share sales]." Similar sentiments came via Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, who called MSTR's preferred stock offering one of the most compelling securities in the market and a next-generation investment vehicle. "STRK is a near-perfect instrument," wrote Park. "It gives you two chances to win: First, when rates go down, it's a huge boon to the principal, and two, if MicroStrategy goes up first, then you have a deep in-the-money (ITM) option to convert and own the higher volatility asset or just directly sell." The largest of the U.S. preferred stock ETFs is the BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF), which has roughly $15 billion in assets under management. The largest holders of PFF ETF are major corporations such as Boeing (BA), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi Group (C). The final pricing terms of the new security are to be completed and announced after the market closes on Thursday.

Title: Saga sets sail with £450m HPS refinancing boost

Saga, the financial services and travel provider to the over-50s, is tapping one of the world's biggest investment firms as part of a refinancing aimed at relieving pressure on its balance sheet. Sky News has learnt that London-listed Saga is lining up HPS - which is in the process of being taken over by the asset management behemoth BlackRock - to help refinance more than £450m of its existing debt. Financiers said an agreement was likely to be announced alongside a scheduled trading update from the company on Thursday morning. Money latest: People who only watch Netflix or Disney 'may have to pay BBC licence fee' The debt involved in the deal comprises a bond, a loan from chairman Sir Roger De Haan and Saga's revolving credit facility. A refinancing will be a boost to Saga, which has been weighed down by a debt pile which is huge relative to the value of its equity. It will come months after the company struck a partnership deal with the Belgian insurer Ageas, which involves a series of cash payments to the British business. In February last year, it also held talks with Open, an Australian company, about a sale of the division but the discussions fell apart. Saga has previously signalled that it would explore a similar partnership model for its cruises division, although a transaction is not thought to be imminent. Shares in Saga have fallen by just over 20% during the last 12 months, leaving it with a market capitalisation of about £165m.

That came after it spurned a takeover bid for the whole company from private equity investors. A Saga spokesperson declined to comment on Wednesday evening. Saga, the financial services and travel provider for over-50s, has said it expects to report an underlying profit before tax above previous guidance. In a trading update, the firm said it expected underlying profit before tax for the last six months of 2024 to come in marginally higher than the year before.

Title: Czech National Bank Plans Multi-Billion Euro Bitcoin Purchase

The governor of the Czech National Bank reportedly wants to invest in bitcoin. The move — involving billions of euros worth of the country’s reserves — could make this the first central bank in a Western nation to hold cryptocurrency assets, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). Governor Aleš Michl said in an interview with the FT that he would present the bank’s board with the idea of investing in bitcoin as a way of diversifying the CNB’s reserves at a Thursday (Jan. 30) meeting. If the board agrees, the bank could someday hold up to 5% of its 140 billion euros of reserves in bitcoin, said Michl. Although he acknowledged bitcoin’s “extreme volatility” and limited record, Michl stressed growing investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other companies launched bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. He also noted President Donald Trump’s push to deregulate the crypto sector and the administration’s embrace of the industry. Trump last week issued an executive order that established a working group to study the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the FT. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The report points out that central banks have typically placed reserves in more conservative assets — U.S. Treasuries, bonds, equities — though none have publicly adopted crypto. Michl said he had “a totally different philosophy” about bitcoin compared to other central bank heads. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer,” Michl said. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” While other central banks may be more reluctant to keep their reserves in bitcoin, they are — as covered here earlier this week — experimenting more frequently with blockchain and tokenization. At the most recent Eurogroup meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) offered an update on its exploration on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions. The bank reported that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. “This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk,” PYMNTS wrote. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will present a proposal this Thursday that could see up to $7 billion of the country's wealth flow into crypto, potentially making it the first Western central bank to hold digital assets. "For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good," Michl said in an interview with the Financial Times, acknowledging his stance differs from other central bankers when it comes to crypto matters. The proposal follows increased institutional interest in Bitcoin after BlackRock and other firms launched spot ETFs. Michl also cited U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance and the growing influence of digital asset executives in his administration. This is not the first time that the country has made crypto headlines. In December, its parliament unanimously passed legislation exempting Bitcoin held over three years from capital gains tax. Earlier this month, Michl was quoted as saying that he had "considered" adopting Bitcoin as a foreign exchange reserve. Broader policy moves in the Eurozone are also shaping up in the background. No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it 🇨🇿🔥 pic.twitter.com/i7E8aZHC2W — Kristian Csepcsar (@KristianCsep) December 6, 2024 Last week, the European Central Bank signaled its readiness for multiple rate cuts in 2025, with ECB President Christine Lagarde indicating a "gradual" approach toward monetary easing, according to reports from Reuters and CNBC out of Davos. Policymakers across Europe are slated to approve the cuts on January 30. The CNB has indeed carved out a niche in central banking with its investment strategies. Explaining its unique approach, Michl explained how the CNB's allocations are different from other central banks. Currently, the CNB allocates 22% of its portfolio to equities—primarily set on U.S. tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft. This is more than what most other central banks allocate, as they typically play it safe with government bonds. They're planning to ramp this up to 30% by 2029, betting on stocks to boost returns, Michl shared in the interview. Meanwhile, most central banks remain skeptical of crypto investments. The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed in December it holds no Bitcoin, while European Central Bank officials maintained in February last year that the "fair value" of Bitcoin is "still zero," reacting to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs a month prior. Given these, Michl acknowledged potential risks, noting Bitcoin could end up worthless or achieve "absolutely fantastic value." Michl said the move is aimed at diversifying reserves rather than just speculating. “My goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good, then let’s have it,” he said. The bank did not immediately return Decrypt's request for comment. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Czech central bank chief proposes huge Bitcoin investment – FT
URL: https://www.rt.com/business/611846-czech-central-bank-bitcoin-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T14:55:43Z
Full Content:
The governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Ales Michl, wants to invest a substantial amount of the country’s reserves in Bitcoin, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. The value of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency hit a new record earlier this month following the inauguration of crypto-friendly US President Donald Trump. Michl told the FT that he will present a proposal to the CNB’s board on Thursday, to invest up to 5% of the central bank’s €140 billion ($145 billion) reserves in crypto. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the publication. The FT has described the potential move as “groundbreaking” and noted that the CNB could become the first Western central bank to hold crypto assets. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people,” Michl added. The banker also acknowledged the asset’s volatility, saying he was “ready” for a possible Bitcoin collapse. Central banks traditionally hold their reserves in conservative assets such as US Treasuries and other forms of high-yield debt. Some have holdings in stocks, but almost none have publicly ventured into cryptocurrencies, the FT noted. Bitcoin hit a new record high this month after Trump was sworn in, surpassing $109,000. Days into his term, the new US president signed an executive order establishing a working group to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Last year, the value of Bitcoin more than doubled, thanks partially to the approval of trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) shares by a US regulator. According to Michl, more central banks could follow his lead within the next five years, as several funds and commercial banks have started investing in crypto. Larry Fink, CEO of investment company BlackRock suggested recently that if institutions allocate between 2% and 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, its price could reach $700,000. Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without the need for traditional banking systems. Its decentralized nature appeals to those seeking alternatives to government-backed currencies. However, this same feature has allegedly made it attractive for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorist financing. Bitcoin’s value is influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, market availability, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment. Despite its growing use in commerce, Bitcoin operates in a regulatory gray area, with no uniform international laws governing its use. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as an official currency in 2021, although many governments remain cautious, warning about the risks associated with investing in such a volatile asset.

The bitcoin price dropped sharply toward $100,000 before bouncing back to around $102,000 though bitcoin and crypto remain subdued despite BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealing a sovereign wealth fund bombshell. Now, as Coinbase's chief executive predicts when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion, bitcoin and crypto traders are braced for the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision after U.S. president Donald Trump called for rates to come down sharply. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates by "a ... [+] lot"—something that many think would boost the bitcoin price and crypto market. The market is pricing in a near-100% certainty that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep interest rates on hold, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, after cutting rates at each of its last three meetings. "The current [bitcoin price] lull can be attributed to risk aversion ahead of the Fed meeting," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in an emailed note. 01/30 update: The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed after the Federal Reserve followed through with its well-telegraphed pause of interest rate cuts yesterday, with the bitcoin price topping $105,000. Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments that indicated he expects inflation to continue to ease helped push bitcoin and crypto prices higher. "Even with the U.S. Federal Reserve pursuing a ‘wait and see’ strategy on further interest rate cuts, bitcoin bulls have little reason to worry," Neil Roarty, cryptocurrency analyst at ClickOut Media, said in emailed comments. "The current 4.25% to 4.5% range is already proving low enough to sustain risk appetite, even if inflation is still higher than the Fed’s target. Bitcoin looks safe above the $100,000 watermark, and it could break higher over the coming months if Donald Trump pressures Jerome Powell into accelerating cuts, as he’s hinted he may. While bitcoin remains an attractive risk-on asset at current rates, a drop below 3% could flood markets with liquidity, further fueling speculation and pushing bitcoin into uncharted territory." Powell also opened the door for banks to start serving crypto companies, provided they take proper precautions. "Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks," Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's rate decision. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing them of failing to get a handle on inflation and the economy and putting pressure on Powell to bring interest rates down through 2025. "Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with inflation, I will do it by unleashing American energy production, slashing regulation, rebalancing international trade, and reigniting American manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping inflation, I will make our country financially, and otherwise, powerful again," Trump posted to his Truth Social account. "The Fed has done a terrible job on bank regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, 'green' energy, and fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in the history of our country." The rate decision will be released Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by the all-important press conference led by Fed chair Jerome Powell in which reporters will press him for a reaction to Trump's comments that interest rates should come down by "a lot." "I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision," Trump said last week. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by the Federal Reserve beginning its ... [+] interest rate cutting cycle. Last year, then-Republican candidate Trump said U.S. presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Fed, raising the possibility it could lose its independence. "We expect [Fed chair Powell] to be as diplomatic as is possible, while firmly committing to Fed independence," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note seen by Axios. "Now that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence," Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told the Financial Times.

Thank you everyone. It’s fantastic to be here at Siemens at this amazing facility. Today, I want to talk about economic growth. Why it matters. How we achieve it. And what we are going to do further and faster to deliver it. Before we came into office… … the Prime Minister and I have said loud and clear: Economic growth is the number one mission of this government. Without growth, we cannot cut hospital waiting lists or put more police on the streets. Without growth, we cannot meet our climate goals… … or give the next generation the opportunities that they need to thrive. But most of all… … without economic growth… … we cannot improve the lives of ordinary working people. Because growth isn’t simply about lines on a graph. It’s about the pounds in people’s pockets. The vibrancy of our high streets. And the thriving businesses that create wealth, jobs and new opportunities for us, for our children, and grandchildren. We will have succeeded in our mission when working people are better off. I know that the cost of living crisis is still very real for many families across Britain. The sky high inflation and interest rates of the past few years have left a deep mark… … with too many people still making sacrifices to pay the bills and to pay their mortgages. But we have begun to turn this around. Everything I see as I travel around the country gives me more belief in Britain. And more optimism about our future. Because we as a country have huge potential. A country of strong communities, with small and local businesses at their heart. We are at the forefront of some of the most exciting developments in the world… … like artificial intelligence and life sciences… … with great companies like DeepMind, AstraZeneca, Rolls Royce… and of course Siemens… … delivering jobs and investment across Britain. We have fundamental strengths – in our history, in our language, and in our legal system – to compete in a global economy. But for too long, that potential has been held back. For too long, we have accepted low expectations and accepted decline. We no longer have to do that. We can do so much better. Low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight. Without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country’s future for the better. That’s what our Plan for Change is all about. That is what drives me as Chancellor. In my Mais lecture in March last year, I set out my approach to achieving economic growth… … and identified the fundamental barriers to realising our full potential. The productive capacity of the UK economy has become far too weak. Productivity, the driver of living standards… …has grown more slowly here than in countries like Germany and the US. The supply side of our economy has suffered due to chronic underinvestment… … and stifling and unpredictable regulation… … not helped by the shocks we have faced in recent years. [redacted political content] The strategy that I have consistently set out… … is to grow the supply-side of our economy… … recognising that first and foremost… … it is businesses, investors and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth… … a government that systematically removes the barriers that they face – one by one and has their back This strategy has three essential elements: First, stability in our politics, our public finances and our economy - the basic condition for secure economic growth. Second, reform - reform which makes it easier for businesses to trade, to raise finance and to build. And third, investment, the lifeblood of economic growth. Let me explain each of those in turn. Stability – the first line of our manifesto was a promise to bring stability to the public finances. It is the rock upon which everything else is built. And it is the essential foundation of our Plan for Change. Because economic stability is the precondition for economic growth. That’s why the first piece of legislation that we passed as a government was the Budget Responsibility Act… … so never again will we see our independent forecaster sidelined. [redacted political content] At my first Budget in October… … it was my duty as Chancellor… … to fix the foundations of our economy, and repair the public finances that we inherited. To restore stability and create the conditions for growth and investment. I set out new fiscal rules which are non-negotiable, and will always be met. We began to rebuild our NHS and our schools – the start of a programme of public service reform. I capped the rate of corporation tax - and I extended our generous capital allowances for the duration of this parliament - as the CBI and the BCC have long called for. And I protected working people after a cost of living crisis… … by freezing fuel duty… … and with no increases in their National Insurance, Income Tax or VAT. But taking the right decisions and the responsible decisions does not always mean taking the easy decisions. The increase in Employers’ National Insurance contributions has consequences on business and beyond. I said that up front in my Budget speech. I accept that there are costs to responsibility. But the costs of irresponsibility would have been far higher. Those who oppose my Budget know that too. That is why, since October, I have seen no alternative put forward [redacted political content]. No alternatives to deal with the challenges we face. No alternatives to restoring economic stability… … and therefore no plan for driving economic growth. Alongside stability, we need to drive forward the reform which makes investment more likely… … by removing the constraints on the supply side of our economy… … making it easier for businesses to trade… … to raise finance… … and to build. Let me first address our approach to trade. We stand at a moment of global change. In that context, we should be guided by one clear principle above all. To act in the national interest… … for our economy… … for our businesses… … and for the British people. That means building on our special relationship with the United States under President Trump. The Prime Minister discussed the vital importance of growth with the President last weekend… … and I look forward to working with the new Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent… … to deepen our economic relationship in the months and the years ahead. Acting in our national interest also means resetting our relationship with the EU – our nearest and our largest trading partner – to drive growth and support business. We are pragmatic about the challenges that we have inherited from the last government’s failed Brexit deal. But we are also ambitious in our goals. [redacted political content] … we will prioritise proposals that are consistent with our manifesto commitments… … and which contribute to British growth and British prosperity… … because that is what the national interest demands. Our approach to trade also means building stronger relationships with fast-growing economies all around the world. That is why I led a delegation to China for the first Economic and Financial Dialogue since 2019… … alongside world-leading financial service businesses, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Schroders… … unlocking £600 million of tangible benefits for the UK economy. And I am pleased to confirm that the Business and Trade Secretary will shortly visit India … … to restart talks on the free trade agreement and bilateral investment treaty [redacted political content]. Our businesses can only realise these opportunities if they can recruit the skilled staff that they need. So we are reforming our employment system to create a national jobs and careers service. We have created Skills England to meet the skills of the next decade in sectors like construction and engineering. And we will deliver fundamental reform of our welfare system. That includes looking at areas that have been ducked for too long… … like the rising cost of health and disability benefits… … and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will set out our plans to address this ahead of the Spring Statement. Next, the Immigration White Paper, that will bring forward concrete proposals to bring the overall levels of net migration down. But we know that the UK is in an international competition for talent in vital growth sectors. That is why last week, I set out plans for attracting global talent. We will look at the visa routes for very highly skilled people… … so the best people in the world choose the UK to live, work and create wealth… … bringing jobs and investment to Britain. To help businesses access the finance and support they need to grow… … we have delivered significant reforms to provide greater flexibility for firms and founders to raise finance on UK capital markets, by rewriting the UK’s listing rules. In my Mansion House speech, I announced a series of reforms to our pensions system… … including the creation of larger, consolidated funds… … which have much greater capacity to invest in high growth British companies at the scale that we need them to. The consultation on these reforms is already complete and the final report will be published in the Spring. Yesterday we confirmed that we have plans to go further, whilst always protecting the important role that pension funds play in the gilt market. We will introduce new flexibilities for well-funded Defined Benefit schemes… … to release surplus funds where it is safe to do so… … generating even more investment into some of our fastest growing industries. I know too that businesses are held back by a complex and unpredictable regulatory system… … and that is a drag on investment and innovation. We have already provided new growth-focused remits to our financial services regulators… … we have announced a new interim Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority… … and we have established the Regulatory Innovation Office, with an initial focus on synthetic biology, space, AI, and connected and autonomous vehicles. But we need to go further and we need to go faster. So earlier this month, I met the Heads of some of our largest regulators. They have already provided a range of options to drive growth in their sectors… … and proposals for how they can be more agile and responsive to businesses… … and we will publish that final action plan in March to make regulation work much better for our economy. To get Britain building again… … we have delivered the most significant reforms to our planning system in a generation. I have been genuinely shocked about how slow our planning system is. By how long it takes to get things done. Take the decision to build a solar farm in Cambridgeshire – a decision the Energy Secretary took only a few weeks into the job in July… [redacted political content] The Deputy Prime Minister has already driven significant progress across government in addressing these issues. My colleagues have determined 13 major planning decisions in just six months… … including for airports, data centres and major housing developments. We have significantly raised housing targets across our country and made them mandatory, so that we can build one-and-a-half million homes in this parliament. We have reformed decades-old “green belt” policies, making it easier to build on the “grey belt” land around our major cities. And we have opened up our planning system to build new infrastructure – like onshore wind farms or data centres driving the AI revolution. Having listened closely to calls from business groups like the Institute of Directors… … and businesses across our economy about the need to speed up infrastructure delivery… … including Mace, Skanska and Arup who are here today… … and members of our British Infrastructure Taskforce like Lloyds, Blackrock and Phoenix… … we have now set out plans to go even further. Last week we confirmed our priorities for the Planning and Infrastructure Bill … … to rapidly streamline the process for determining applications… … to make the consultation process far less burdensome… … and to fundamentally reform our approach to environmental regulation. The problems in our economy… … the lack of bold reform that we have seen over decades… … can be summed up by a £100 million bat tunnel built for HS2… … the type of decision that has made delivering major infrastructure in our country far too expensive and far too slow. So we are reducing the environmental requirements placed on developers when they pay into the nature restoration fund that we have created… …so they can focus on getting things built, and stop worrying about bats and newts. And to build our new infrastructure like nuclear power plants, trainlines and windfarms more quickly… … we are changing the rules to stop blockers getting in the way of development… … through excessive use of Judicial Review. This Bill, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, is a priority for this government. It will be introduced in the Spring… … and we will work tirelessly in parliament to ensure its smooth, and speedy and rapid delivery. By providing a foundation of economic stability… … and by delivering the reforms needed to make it easier for businesses to succeed and grow… … we will create the right conditions to increase investment in our economy – the final key element of our strategy. Investment and innovation go hand in hand. I want to see the sounds and the sights of the future arriving. Delivered by amazing businesses like Wayve and Oxford Nanopore. They are the future. And Britain should be the best place in the world to be an entrepreneur. That is why we protected funding for research and development… … and it is why one of the first decisions I made as Chancellor… … was to extend the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the Venture Capital Trust schemes for a further 10 years… … to get more investment into new companies, driving their innovation and growth. I am determined to make Britain the best place in the world to invest. That was my message in Davos last week. That ambition demands action. The International Investment Summit that we hosted in October delivered £63 billion of investment right across our country… … from Iberdrola doubling its investment in clean energy in places like Suffolk… … Blackstone investing £10 billion in a data centre in Northumberland… … and Eren Holdings investing £1 billion in advanced manufacturing in North Wales. While the lifeblood of growth is business investment, a strategic state has a crucial role to play. That is why we established the National Wealth Fund… … to create that partnership between business, private investors and government to invest in the industries of the future… … like clean energy. Today I can announce two further investments by the National Wealth Fund. First, a £65 million investment for Connected Kerb, to expand their electric vehicle charging network across the UK. And second, a £28 million equity investment in Cornish Metals… … providing the raw materials to be used in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles… … supporting growth and jobs in the South-West of England. There is no trade-off between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century, and Britain must lead the way. That is why we will publish a refreshed Carbon Budget Delivery Plan later this year, which alongside the Spending Review, will set out our plans to deliver Carbon Budget 6. Today, I can also announce that we are removing barriers to deliver 16 gigawatts of offshore wind… … by designating new Marine Protected Areas to enable the development of this technology in areas like East Anglia and Yorkshire… … crowding in up to £30 billion of investment in homegrown clean power. And there’s more. Our industrial and manufacturing base, brilliantly represented by Make UK, have been banging their heads against the wall for years at the lack of a proper industrial strategy from government. That is why we have launched our modern industrial strategy… … to drive investment into the industries that will define our success in the years ahead. We have already provided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences… … and we have set out reforms to boost financial services, the AI sector and creative industries. We are not wasting any time, and we will move forward with the next stages of the Industrial Strategy ahead of its publication in the Spring. We will work with the private sector to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs. This includes the Lower Thames Crossing, which will improve connectivity at Port of Tilbury and Dover, London Gateway and Medway… … alleviating severe congestion… … as goods destined for export come from the North, and the Midlands and across the country to markets overseas. To drive growth and deliver value for money for taxpayers, we are exploring options to privately finance this important project. And we have changed course on public investment, too… … with a new Investment Rule to ensure that we don’t just count the costs of investment – we count the benefits too. We are now investing 2.6% of GDP on average over the next five years, compared to 1.9% planned by the previous government.. … delivering an additional £100 billion of growth-enhancing capital spending… … which catalyses private sector investment… … in more housing… … better transport links… … and clean energy. These are significant steps in just six months… … and we are seeing some encouraging signs in the British economy. The IMF have upgraded our growth prospects for 2025… … the only G7 country outside the US to see this happen. This gives us the fastest growth of any major European economy this year. And a global survey of CEOs by PWC, has shown Britain is now the second most attractive country in the world for businesses looking to invest. The first time the UK has been in that position for 28 years. This is all welcome news. But there is still more that we can and will do. I am not satisfied with the position we are in. While we have huge amounts of potential, the structural problems in our economy run deep. And the low growth of the last 14 years cannot just be turned around overnight. This has to be our focus for the duration of the parliament. Because the situation demands us to do more. And today I will go further and faster in kickstarting economic growth. Our mission to grow our economy is about raising living standards in every single part of the United Kingdom. Manchester is home to the UK’s fastest growing tech sector. Leeds is one of the largest financial services centres outside of London. These great northern cities have so much potential and promise… …which our brilliant metro mayors, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin, are working hard to realise… … just like our other metro mayors are doing to deliver new opportunities in their areas. And there is so much more that government can do to support our city regions. To achieve this requires greater focus on two key areas: infrastructure and investment. If we can improve connectivity between towns and cities across the North of England, we can unlock their true growth potential… … by making it easier for people to live, travel and work across the area. At the Budget, I set out funding for the Transpennine Route Upgrade… … a multi-billion-pound programme of improvements that will connect towns and cities from Manchester to York via Stalybridge, Leeds and Huddersfield. We are delivering railway schemes to improve journeys for people across the North… … including upgrades at Bradford Forster Square and by electrifying the Wigan-Bolton line. We have committed to supporting the delivery of a new mass transit system in West Yorkshire. And in Spring, we will publish the Spending Review and a 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy… … which will set out further detail of our plans for infrastructure right across the UK. New transport infrastructure can also act as a catalyst for new housing. We have already seen the benefits that unlocking untapped land around stations can deliver in places like Stockport… … where joint work spearheaded by Andy Burnham and council leaders has delivered new housing and wider commercial opportunities. We will introduce a new approach to planning decisions on land around stations, changing the default answer to yes. We are working with the devolved governments to ensure the benefits of growth can be felt across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland… … including by partnering with them on the Industrial Strategy to support their considerable sectoral strengths. And in December, I met with Metro Mayors from across England. They told me that more opportunities for investment are vital if their local economies are to grow in the years ahead. We are listening closely to them. As the Metro Mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotherham, has called for… … we will review the Green Book and how it is being used to provide objective, transparent advice on public investment across the country, including outside London and the Southeast. This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead. The Office for Investment is going to be working hand in hand with local areas… … to develop a commercially attractive pipeline of investment opportunities for a global audience… … starting with the Liverpool City Region and the North East Combined Authority, led by Kim McGuinness. The National Wealth Fund is establishing strategic partnerships to provide deeper, more focused support for city regions, starting in Glasgow, West Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and Greater Manchester. We are supporting key investment opportunities across the UK. The government is backing Andy Burnham’s plans for the redevelopment of Old Trafford, which promises to create new housing and commercial development around a new stadium… … to drive regeneration and growth in the area. We are moving forward with the Wrexham and Flintshire Investment Zone… … focusing on the area’s strengths in advanced manufacturing… … backed by major businesses like Airbus and JCB… … to leverage £1 billion of private investment in the next ten years… … creating up to 6,000 jobs. [redacted political content] So I can announce today that we will work with Doncaster Council and the Mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard… … to support their efforts to recreate South Yorkshire Airport City as a thriving regional airport. And finally, I am pleased to announce a partnership between Prologis and Manchester Airport Group in the East Midlands, where the Metro Mayor Claire Ward is doing an excellent job growing the local economy there. Prologis and MAG will work together to build a new advanced manufacturing and logistics park at East Midlands Airport … … unlocking up to £1 billion of investment and 2,000 jobs at the site… … a major investment from a global business into our country… … representing a huge vote of confidence in the East Midlands and in the UK. This is just the start of our work to get more investment into every nation and region of Britain. Next, I want to set out further detail for plans for the area we are in today. Oxford and Cambridge offer huge potential for our nation’s growth prospects. Only 66 miles apart… … these cities are home to two of the best universities in the world… … and the area is a hub for globally renowned science and technology firms. This area has the potential to be Europe’s Silicon Valley. To make that a reality, we need a systematic approach to attract businesses to come here and to grow here. At the moment, it takes over two and a half hours to travel between Oxford and Cambridge by train. There is no way to commute directly by rail from places like Bedford and Milton Keynes to Cambridge. And there is a lack of affordable housing right across the region. In other words, the demand is there… … but there are far too many supply side constraints on economic growth here. We are going to fix that. The Ox Cam arc was initially launched in 2003 – over 20 years ago. [redacted political content] We are not prepared to miss out on the opportunities here any longer. So working with the Deputy Prime Minister… … who is already driving forward vital work in the region… … we are going further and faster to unlock the potential of the Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor. First, we are funding the transport links needed to make the Oxford Cambridge growth corridor a success… … including East-West Rail, with new services between Oxford and Milton Keynes starting this year… … and road upgrades to reduce journey times between Milton Keynes and Cambridge. East West Rail will also support vibrant new and expanded communities along the route. We have already received proposals for New Towns along the new railway… … with 18 submissions for sizeable new developments. At Tempsford – the nexus of the East Coast Mainline, the A1 and East West Rail… …we will move quicker to deliver a mainline station, meaning journey times to London of under an hour… … and to Cambridge in under 30 minutes when East West Rail is operational. Second, we are ensuring that the area has the right infrastructure and public services in place to support the growth corridor as it expands. A new Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital is being prioritised for investment as part of wave 1 of the New Hospital Programme. Water infrastructure has also been a major hindrance to development. So we have now agreed water resources management plans, unlocking £7.9 billion of investment in the next 5 years… …including plans for the new Fens Reservoir serving Cambridge and the South East Strategic Reservoir near Oxford. And I can confirm today that the Environment Agency have now lifted their objections to new development in Cambridge, following this government’s intervention to address water scarcity… … which means 4,500 additional homes, new schools, and new office, retail and laboratory space can be built. Third, I am delighted that Cambridge University have come forward with plans for a new flagship innovation hub at the centre of Cambridge… … to attract global investment and foster a community that catalyses innovation, as other cities around the world like Boston and Paris have done. Just yesterday, Moderna completed the build for their new vaccine production and R&D site in Harwell, right here in Oxfordshire, alongside a commitment to invest a further £1 billion in the UK. And we are creating a new AI Growth Zone in Culham to speed up planning approvals for the rapid build-out of data centres. And finally, to take this project forward at real pace… … and catalyse private sector investment into the region… … I am pleased to announce that the Deputy Prime Minister and I have asked Lord Patrick Vallance to be the champion for the Oxford Cambridge Growth Corridor. Lord Vallance has extensive experience across the sciences, academia, and government. He will work with local leaders and with the Housing and Planning Minister to deliver this exciting project… … including with Peter Freeman, who is already doing excellent work in Cambridge… … and a new Growth Commission for Oxford, which will help to accelerate growth in the city and its surrounding area. This is the government’s modern Industrial Strategy in action. With central government, local leaders and business working together… … the Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor could add up to £78 billion to the UK economy by 2035 … … driving investment, innovation and growth. Finally, I come to the decision that perhaps more than any other… … has been delayed… … has been avoided… … has been ducked. The question of whether to give Heathrow … … our only hub airport… … a third runway… … has run on for decades. The last full length runway in Britain was built in the 1940s. No progress in eighty years. Why is this so damaging? It’s because Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country. It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three-quarters of all long-haul flights in the UK go from Heathrow. Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers used Heathrow in 2023. But for decades, its growth has been constrained. Successive studies have shown that this really matters for our economy. According to the most recent study from Frontier Economics, a third runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050. Over half – 60% of that boost, would go to areas outside London and the South-East. … increasing trade opportunities for products like Scotch whiskey and Scottish salmon - already two of the biggest British exports out of Heathrow. And a third runway could create over 100,000 jobs. For international investors, persistent delays have cast doubt about our seriousness towards improving our economic prospects. Business groups, like the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Chambers of Commerce right across the UK… …as well trade unions like GMB and Unite are clear… … a third runway is badly needed. In 2018, the previous government steered its Airports National Policy Statement through parliament. But no action was taken. It simply sat on the shelf. We are taking a totally different approach to airport expansion. This Government has already given its support to expansion at City Airport and at Stansted. And there are two live decisions on Luton and Gatwick which will be made by the Transport Secretary shortly. But as our only hub airport, Heathrow is in a unique position - and we cannot duck the decision any longer. I have always been clear that a third runway at Heathrow would unlock further growth… … boost investment… … increase exports… … and make the UK more open and more connected. And now, the case is stronger than ever… … because our reforms to the economy… … like speeding up the planning system… … and our plans for modernised UK airspace… … mean the delivery of this project is set up for success. So I can confirm today that this Government supports a third runway at Heathrow… … and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer. We will then take forward a full assessment through the Airport National Policy Statement. That will ensure that the project is value for money - and our clear expectation is that any associated surface transport costs will be financed through private funding. And it will ensure that a third runway is delivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate obligations. Heathrow themselves are clear that their proposal for expansion will meet strict rules on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. And we are already making great strides in transitioning to cleaner and greener aviation. Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuel by around 70%. At the start of this month, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate became law. And today I can announce that we are investing £63 million into the Advanced Fuels Fund over the next year… … and we have today set out the details of how we will deliver a Revenue Certainty Mechanism to encourage investment into this growing industry. These measures will encourage more investors to back production in the UK, bringing good, high-skilled jobs to areas like Teesside… … demonstrating that investment in the right technology can help us deliver both our growth and our clean energy missions. Now is the moment to grasp the opportunity in front of us. By backing a third runway at Heathrow, we can make Britain the world’s best connected place to do business. That is what it takes to make bold decisions in the national interest. That is what I mean by going further and faster to kickstart economic growth. The work of change has begun. We have already made great progress. But I am not satisfied. And I know that there is more to be done. We must go further and faster if we are to build a brighter future. The prize on offer is immense. The next generation with more opportunities than the last. An engineer in Teesside, working in some of the most exciting industries of the future – from carbon capture to sustainable aviation fuel. A scientist in Milton Keynes or Bedford, working in our life sciences industry to solve some of the most important medical challenges in the world. A small business owner in Scotland, knowing that they can expand and export to new markets right across the globe. Wealth created, and wealth shared, in every part of Britain. This is a Government on the side of working people. Taking the right decisions to secure their future, to secure our future. Stepping up to the challenges we face. Ending the era of low expectations. Putting Britain on a different path. Delivering for the British people. And I am determined, this Government is determined, to do just that. Thank you.

Title: Uber-backed mobility fintech Moove acquires Brazil’s Kovi, takes ARR to $275M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Uber-backed Moove, an Africa-born mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, has acquired Kovi, a Brazilian urban mobility provider. The value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Moove confirmed it was an all-share transaction, and Kovi is now wholly owned by Moove. Moove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told TechCrunch that the deal bumps the mobility fintech’s annual revenue to $275 million. Last March, Moove reported a $115 million ARR. The news comes two months after Moove announced a partnership with Waymo to provide driverless vehicle fleet operations in two U.S. cities, Phoenix and Miami. Delano said Moove’s acquisition of the São Paulo-based Kovi marks a significant step toward the company’s goal of building the world’s largest rideshare fleet. What began with 76 cars in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2020 has now grown to 36,000 cars operating in 19 cities across six continents, with Latin America now emerging as a key market. Similarly, the acquisition unites two companies tackling the same challenge — providing financing solutions for rideshare drivers. Founded in 2018, Y Combinator-backed Kovi launched to make vehicle ownership more accessible in Brazil. Following the acquisition, pending approval from the Brazilian antitrust authority, Kovi will continue to operate under its brand while its executive and management teams will remain unchanged. While Moove will keep the Kovi brand operating in its existing markets, Brazil and Mexico, there are plans to expand further across Latin America. Moove recently launched operations in three cities across Colombia and Mexico. As such, the acquisition further cements Moove’s position in Latin America, giving the company a major foothold in Brazil, the region’s largest ride-hail market. “We’re incredibly excited about working with a fantastic team of like-minded individuals at Kovi who set up this business to address a similar problem that we found in Nigeria,” he remarked. “Kovi is one of the top two players in Brazil. So we have not just entered or strengthened our presence in the Latin American market but also put ourselves in a top-two position in the largest single market in Latin America through this acquisition.” Moove has built a third pillar in the global mobility marketplace by offering vehicle supply to ride-hailing platforms. This includes its flagship Drive-to-Own product, a taxi and employment model, and an emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) business line involving AI-driven mobility. While AI plays a key role in its AV business line, Delano says the company’s AI mobility strategy will span the entire business, from optimizing traditional ride-hailing services to improving fleet management, according to Delano. This is where the Kovi acquisition comes in. According to the chief executive, Kovi’s proprietary technology and algorithms will “complement and strengthen our existing Moove AI mobility strategy and ensure that we can start to deliver an improved service and product to our customers around the world.” It’s unclear whether Kovi was struggling financially before its acquisition by Moove. Its last known funding round was a $104 million Series B in 2021 from investors like Valor Capital, Prosus Ventures, and Quona Capital. Despite raising funds to expand across Latin America, Kovi primarily focused on Brazil. That year, it reported $45 million in ARR, growing 15% month-over-month. The all-share transaction makes Kovi’s investors shareholders in Moove, aligning their growth trajectories. In a statement, Kovi CEO Adhemar Milani Neto expressed confidence in the deal. “I met the founders [Moove’s Delano and Jide Odunsi] many years back when they were scaling their business in Africa, and I was immediately impressed by their purpose-driven approach, which is also a perfect match to our culture. Together, I believe we will become a truly global category-defining business and will leverage scale and deep expertise never seen in our market.” Moove raised a $100 million Uber-led Series B last year at a $750 million valuation. The mobility fintech has secured over $500 million in debt and equity from backers like Mubadala, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Janus Henderson, and the IFC (World Bank) since its launch five years ago. Delano declined to comment on potential new fundraising efforts. Instead, he stressed that the company will focus on driving its capex-heavy business to profitability this year and realizing its vision of building the largest ride-hailing fleet globally.

Title: Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK): Is This Healthcare Stock A Good Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other healthcare stocks. Healthcare stocks are widely considered a cornerstone of a retirement portfolio due to their resilience, long-term growth potential, and ability to provide steady income through dividends. This sector encompasses pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, biotechnology firms, and medical device manufacturers, all of which are positioned to benefit from enduring trends like aging populations and advancements in medical technology. One of the most compelling reasons to include health stocks in a retirement portfolio is their defensive nature. Health care is a necessity, not a luxury, meaning demand for medical products and services remains steady, even during economic downturns. According to a report by Morningstar, the healthcare sector outperformed the broader market in 75% of US recessions over the past 50 years, demonstrating its ability to provide stability when other sectors falter. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Global demographic trends also favor health stocks. The United Nations projects that the number of people aged 65 and older will double by 2050, reaching 1.5 billion. This aging population will drive increased demand for chronic disease management, prescription medications, and long-term care services. The US alone spends over $4.3 trillion annually on health care, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, accounting for nearly 20% of GDP. This figure is expected to rise to $6.8 trillion by 2030, driven by advances in medical technology and higher spending on aging-related health issues. Health stocks, particularly those of established pharmaceutical companies, often provide attractive dividend yields, making them ideal for income-focused retirees. Drug giants are known for consistently paying and increasing dividends. Dividends provide retirees with regular income, reducing the need to sell assets during market downturns. The healthcare sector is also at the forefront of technological innovation, offering exposure to high-growth areas such as biotechnology, precision medicine, and artificial intelligence in healthcare. Healthcare stocks provide diversification in a retirement portfolio as well, balancing out more volatile sectors like technology or energy. Additionally, healthcare ETFs like the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund offer exposure to a wide range of companies, spreading risk while capturing growth potential. For example, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has delivered a 10-year annualized return of 13.4%, outperforming many other sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected health stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) operates as a healthcare company worldwide. There are several aspects that make this company an attractive investment choice. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has achieved 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, surpassing the sector median of 2 years by 600%. Secondly, the company has also maintained 35 consecutive years of dividend payments, outperforming the sector median of 15 years by 133.33%. This shows the company’s ability to generate profit and provide value to its shareholders, which are indicators of strong financial growth. Moreover, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has also announced a $17 million commitment over five years (2025-2030) to advance equitable access to culturally responsive care for people with heart conditions in the US communities. Overall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the healthcare stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

EditorCrypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun, Krisztian Sandor The Securities and Exchange Commission had previously only allowed cash redemptions when the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved last January. Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs including IBIT last January, the agency allowed to launch the funds with cash redemption, instead of bitcoin. “It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Discover actionable insights for crafting authentic impactful campaigns and enhancing your SEO efforts, while elevating your brand. Three events, including a $500k investment, signal that a parallel WordPress community is gaining momentum Three recent events may signal the direction in which the WordPress community is evolving and have the feel of pieces falling into place. What’s happening isn’t a change in the WordPress community itself but the emergence of a parallel one. There is movement to build a parallel community and infrastructure to WordPress. The goal is to bring stability to WordPress and ensure that it continues to be the world’s most popular content management system. Recent events related to the Automattic and Mullenweg dispute with WP Engine have given rise to actions that may in time wrest control of WordPress away from Automattic and Matt Mullenweg. This second approach of creating an alternative WordPress community gained major support from GoDaddy in the form of a half million dollar donation to the non-profit The WP Community Collective, a group whose goal is to support an independent WordPress open source ecosystem. GoDaddy explained: “GoDaddy …just invested a half-million dollars in the WordPress community through a donation to The WP Community Collective, an initiative focused on funding and empowering WordPress contributors. This monetary support will be directed towards providing financial, operational and promotional support within the greater WordPress community. The WP Community Collective contribution by GoDaddy… aims to strengthen open source communities by providing resources for designers, developers and other contributors who make the internet work.” What makes the GoDaddy funding interesting is that one of the investors in GoDaddy, BlackRock, is also an investor in Automattic. BlackRock recently lowered the value of their stake in Automattic, which is said to currently be less than one percent. The second piece of the alternative WordPress community is in the form of an investment made by Joost de Valk in an actual WordPress business community that was founded 15 years ago. Joost is turning it into a non-profit and setting it up with a governance board. According to the announcement: “…we’re excited about this community and the history that has brought Post Status to where it is – a true staple of the WordPress community where thoughts flow freely, business is done, and mutual support is abundant. …Over the past few months, it’s become very clear that Post Status is an enormously important place for the community to come together and discuss all things WordPress. A place with light moderation, but also with true freedom of speech (within the boundaries of treating everyone with respect) and the freedom to have different opinions. We want to enshrine those freedoms even more. That’s why we (Marieke and myself) will be buying Post Status” Joost de Valk, the founder of Yoast SEO plugins, has recently become an outspoken advocate of changing WordPress governance to a more democratic model and of creating a parallel WordPress structure that secures and stabilizes the distribution of WordPress themes and plugins. There have been ongoing discussions across the WordPress community about decentralizing plugin and theme distribution so that WordPress.org, which is controlled by Automattic and Matt Mullenweg, is no longer the sole source. Decentralization would remove that control by distributing software through multiple channels. Karim Marucchi (LinkedIn profile), well known in the WordPress community as a leader in enterprise WordPress development, wrote about securing the supply chain in reference to making the availability of plugin and themes secure and trustworthy. He wrote: “Securing the Supply Chain & Start Modernization The first step is to act on what Joost called Federated And Independent Repositories. It is absolutely imperative that we show the world that we have supply chain security. To create a community Plugin, we should immediately form a collaboration group between independent contributors, multiple hosting companies, agencies, and the broader product community within our ecosystems. Designed from day one to prevent any business or entity from disrupting the supply chain” Joost de Valk recently wrote about the importance of a federated repository: “We need to supplement WordPress.org updates with other sources, so that what happened to Advanced Custom Fields, can’t happen again. Lots of hosts are currently experimenting with or already putting in place mirrors of WordPress.org. This creates issues: download and active install statistics are no longer reliable, for instance. Just having mirrors of WordPress.org also doesn’t really solve the problem of a single party controlling our single update server. For that, we need to make sure that those mirrors federate with each other, and share each others data and, as Karim suggested, allow for independent plugins and themes to be hosted there, outside of the wordpress.org repository. I call this: Federated and Independent Repositories, in short: FAIR. I’m already talking to several hosts about this, and would welcome anyone who wants to join these conversations, so we’re not duplicating work.” There is now a project called AspirePress that aims to decentralize WordPress which has been gathering momentum. AspirePress intends to become a mirror repository and eventually become a decentralized distributed model, which is expressed in their motto at the top of every page: “Decentralize. Distribute. Democratize.” AspirePress is committed to being a truly open source WordPress community project: “AspirePress is a community-driven open-source project aimed at providing resources and tools to improve the lives of WordPress developers everywhere. We are focused on building a package mirror to freely distribute plugins and themes to WordPress users, no matter who or where they are.” AspirePress is an example of people in the WordPress community taking steps to decentralize WordPress so that one entity can’t unilaterally take over someone else’s plugin and replace it with their own as Automattic and Matt Mullenweg did to WP Engine’s highly popular ACF plugin which was completely replaced with a renamed version controlled by Automattic. Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were Stanford university students who at a certain point decided that it was in their company’s best interest to bring in a CEO with experience to take over and that’s what happened. Google’s founders still remained involved in the company but CEO seat was filled by someone else who was trustworthy. Google’s one of the largest and most influential companies in the world and is an example of founders who successfully relinquished control to more experienced hands. So it’s not like there is no precedent of a company founder who successfully handed control to someone else in order to grow the company. There are other examples in the open source community as well: These examples of successful transitions in for-profit and open-source organizations demonstrate that change in leadership and control can lead to growth. The three developments discussed in this article reflect the gradual shifts occurring in WordPress, a platform that supports thousands of jobs and generates billions in revenue worldwide. Stakeholders invested in WordPress’s stability may see these developments as steps toward that goal.

Title: CNB considers shifting up to 5% of Czech reserves into Bitcoin

Governor Michl advocates Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid increasing institutional adoption across the world. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will reportedly propose adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets, Financial Times reported on Jan. 29. If approved, his plan would see the bank eventually allocate as much as 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves to Bitcoin, moving beyond its traditional gold and US dollar holdings. Earlier this month, he hinted at potential adjustments to the bank’s reserve strategy, suggesting a broader approach to asset allocation. Bitwise’s European Head of Research, André Dragosch, said the proposed investment could amount to $7.3 billion in Bitcoin. This would place CNB’s BTC reserves above its $4.3 billion gold holdings and account for roughly 5.3 months of newly mined Bitcoin. Dragosch said: “Czech central bank holds around 146 billion USD in official reserve assets of which 138 billion USD are FX reserves and 4.3 billion USD are gold. They plan to invest up to 5% of these reserves into BTC (approximately 7.3 billion USD / ~71,568 BTC).” CNB’s Michl sees Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid rising institutional adoption. He pointed to growing interest in crypto-related investment products, particularly after asset managers like BlackRock launched BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He also noted shifting US policies, including President Donald Trump‘s deregulation efforts and increased engagement between crypto firms and policymakers. Under the Trump administration, the US has adopted a more friendly disposition to the emerging industry and recently signed an executive order designed to make America a leader in the sector. Michl said: “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good…Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” Although Bitcoin remains volatile, Michl believes its rising adoption justifies its inclusion in national reserves. He acknowledged the risks but emphasized the CNB’s experience in managing fluctuating assets. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value . . . but in our history we have also had some stocks like Enron or the payment company Wirecard, so we have some experience with bad investments, so, yes, I’m ready [for a possible Bitcoin collapse],” he said.

Title: Ten Greek CEOs making global history

Time Published: 2025-01-29T09:03:15Z

At a time when the rate of replacement of CEOs in large corporations worldwide has skyrocketed to historic highs (1,800 layoffs or voluntary departures between October 2023 – October 2024 were recently reported by “Financial Times”), Greek or Greek-born CEOs are not only staying in their positions, but new ones are being added. From the most influential across the international business world, such as Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase or Ron Vachris of Costco and Albert Bourla of Pfizer, to new entrants such as Duke Energy’s Harry Sideris, the Greeks and Greek heads of multinational conglomerates and national business leaders of major economies, e.g. Germany, Australia, etc, have proved resilient. They have managed to adapt and successfully reshape the business plans of the huge companies they lead in the rapidly changing economic, commercial and business environment. In conditions of long-term inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and constant turmoil in supply chains, Greek leaders are withstanding the relentless competition and moving forward…All of them are writing their own chapter now in international business developments, all over the globe. Their main weapons include excellent training, creative spirit, flexibility and adaptability, as well as strong personal ambition, elements that make up the profile of a successful CEO. Many are quick to associate their successful careers with the Greek DNA, which means combativeness, perseverance in the goal, ability to survive in adverse conditions. What is certain is that these are indeed common elements that are found in everyone’s individual success story. And some of them do justice to their Greek roots, as they exert their influence in the implementation of significant investments in our country. Pierre-Emanuel Angeloglou – LVMH Fashion Group Mr Fendi On March 5, 2024, on the day of his birthday, one of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnaud called one of his close associates, the Greek-born Pierre-Emanuel Angeloglou, and gave him a great gift: he announced his promotion to CEO of several brands in his empire. He’s the new CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, which houses brands like Fendi, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Stella McCartney, Patou and Off-White. He comes from L’Oreal, where he rose to the top of its hierarchy as its global general manager in 2017-19. At that time, the company’s active cosmetics business saw record sales growth of +15.5%. In 2019, however, the resourceful Arnaud has thrown him into the deep end at Louis Vuitton as director of strategic missions, in charge of fashion and leather goods. In 2022, he became deputy general manager and executive vice president. His responsibilities include men’s products, where during his tenure revenues soared to €5 billion, as well as women’s accessories, digital innovation, communications, and events. The latter two areas are vital for a company with more than 50 million followers on its Instagram and TikTok accounts. A new surprise for Angeloglou followed. At the end of May last year, it was announced that he was personally taking on the role of CEO of Fendi. And many don’t believe that the next internal restructuring of Louis Vuitton patriarch Bernard Arnaud (who will hold the reins until 2029, before handing it over to his five children) will likely elevate him even higher, to the position of CEO of the giant. After all, he is a “multinational”, as he speaks seven languages, and now has all the necessary credentials. However, he doesn’t speak Greek. Ron Vachis – Costco From forklift driver COSCO, the Chinese giant that manages the port of Piraeus, and Costco, little known in Greece, are separated by just one… “t”. But also an abyss of tens of billions of dollars. The just 42-year-old American retailer is a multinational giant, spread across dozens of countries, with 890 warehouses/stores, operating mainly through the membership/subscriber system and with revenues last year of $254 billion. Third largest global retailer, behind only Walmart and Target Corporation, at No. 12 in the Fortune-500. Its big competitive advantage is its private label products, discount prices and subscription system. And with 333,000 employees, led by a Greek-born, highly capable manager. His name is Ron Vachris. He took over as president and CEO of Costco in January 2024, having previously, for 28 years, worked his way up through all ranks. Starting as a seasonal forklift driver (!) while studying Business Administration at Glendale Community College in Arizona, he climbed all the rungs to the top. He is the epitome of technocratic genius, hard work, perseverance, and immense modesty. “Throughout the company, there are many like me. But there is only one CEO position, so I happened to be in it,” he said recently. Lucky? Costco shareholders (Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and others) probably think differently to set him apart from the rest of the executives at the company, whose doctrine is to elevate its leaders from within. The 60-year-old Vachris works in an office on the 9th floor of Costco’s headquarters, just a little larger than his colleagues. His favorite spot in the new building, in a city of just 40,000 people called “Issaquah,” in Seattle, Washington state, is the ground-floor cafeteria, where he socializes with employees. Last year’s earnings topped $12.5 million. He was born in Staten Island, New York, and moved to Arizona as a teenager. He and his 58-year-old wife, Kim, have two boys, 37 and 33, a daughter, 26, and a granddaughter. Constantina Kanellopoulou – Deutsche Wohnen S.A. Leader in real estate Konstantina Kanellopoulou, 42, has been one of the heavyweights of the German real estate market in recent years. A senior executive at Vonovia for seven years since 2014, she became co-managing director of Deutsche Wohnen S.A. on January 1, 2022, when her company was acquired for €19.1 billion by the country’s real estate leader, which manages more than half a million properties. After a productive stint as co-CEO for DW, she moved in August 2023 to become chairman and CEO at subsidiary GSW Immobilien AG, which celebrated 100 years in business last year. GSW owns around 61,000 residential units in Berlin and is focused on long-term management of rental apartments. Its real estate portfolio is valued at around EUR 3,3 billion. In 2011 it was listed on the Stock Exchange and was acquired by DW two years later. Its Greek head studied business administration at the University of Minster. He worked in Customer Service at Arvato and Deutsche Annington Immobilien, Bochum. And then in 2014 at Vonovia, where the launch came. She believes that climate change and an aging society will shape the housing market in the coming years: ‘The demand for living space is one thing, but we also have to look at how we can renovate that space energy-wise,’ she says. Although she is one of Germany’s most important technocratic personalities, Konstantina Kanellopoulou is projected strictly for her work alone. She is a recognizable face at the opening of a new project or through an interview about the apartment market in the country, a topic that “burns” Germans. Merilyn Paspaley – Paspaley Pearls, Pinctada Hotels & Resorts The Queen of Pearls 74-year-old Marilyn Paspaley started as an actress, but life led her into business. It makes sense, since her father Nicholas Paspalis, starting in the 1930s, managed to build an entire empire on the coast of Western Australia, arriving there from Castellorizo. An empire in the pearl market primarily, Paspaley Pearls, but it expanded into wine, aviation, real estate, and even the “Wall Street Hotel” in New York. At the multinational giant, the successor was Nicholas Paspaley Jr. and his sister Rosalyn Bracher. The second sister, Marilyn, after a career in television series, took the helm of the company. This may have happened without much effort, but it does nothing to diminish Marilyn’s status and successes as CEO of the company. In 2008 she was awarded the Order of Australia for her contribution to the marketing and promotion of Australian-designed pearls and jewellery. She has focused on the development of the hotel market-leading subsidiary Pinctada Hotels & Resorts in the world-class resort of Kimberley in north-western Australia, with a range of ultra-luxury resorts. However, on her frequent European trips she prefers luxury Swiss destinations such as St Moritz. Hari Sideris – Duke Energy The new leader Harry Sideris is the youngest to join the list of the world’s top Greek-born CEOs. The definition of an executive who has fought for three decades very hard, with diligence, consistency, and professionalism, climbing step by step up the ladder of a great energy company like Duke Energy. Raised in Asheville, North Carolina, by Greek immigrant parents, he studied chemical engineering and then charted an upward trajectory at the same company, reaching the presidency last year and, as of April 1 this year, will take over as CEO, succeeding Lynn Goode. The company whose helm the 53-year-old Sideris will keep is no accident. It’s listed on the NYSE, with 121 years of history behind it. Its headquarters are at the Duke Energy Plaza in Charlotte, North Carolina. Other than that it electrifies and supplies natural gas to Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, and Puerto Rico. It operates 11 nuclear power plants at six sites in North and South Carolina. With revenues of $29.06 billion in 2023, over 30,000 employees, and nearly 8 million customers, it was ranked as the 141st largest company in the US in 2024, steadily climbing up the rungs of the Fortune 500 list and aiming for the Top 100 this year. Harry Sideris lives in Charlotte with his wife Catherine and their two daughters, Marie and Zoe. Evangelia Wletta – Skyline Equities Realty He “built” Miami Evangelia Gouleta is a first-generation Greek-American businesswoman. Her company’s sales reach over $5 billion in many parts of the US, particularly in the greater Miami area. For a time she was also the “first lady” of New York City, between 1981-82, as the wife of then-state governor Hugh Carey, whom she divorced in 1989. Her parents were originally from Euboea and Santorini, while Guleta was born in Athens during the difficult years of the Occupation. Her family soon immigrated to Chicago where, when she was 17, her father bought a building with 6 apartments. She then gave him $700, which she had saved from jobs she did in the afternoons after school, as a down payment on one of the six apartments and paid the mortgage payment for the remaining amount each month. Today, the demonic Greek is president and CEO of Skyline Equities Realty, a company that acquires, builds, and develops luxury real estate in upscale areas. She has sold tens of thousands of properties and the name “Evangeline” is synonymous with prestigious addresses. Its portfolio includes “Buckingham Plaza” in Chicago, “Barclay Tower” in Denver, “Lafayette” shopping center, “Century of Progress” in Chicago, and “Skyline” on the famous Brickell Avenue, also known as “Millionaire’s Row” in Miami. Goleta is interested in Greece and is involved in many Greek-American organizations, including the Hellenic American Women’s Council (HAWC). In recognition of this quiet contribution, AHEPA Greece honored her at the first AHEPA Awards last December with the Greek American Personality Award for her promotion of Hellenism, dedication to family and personal development, and contributions to social and charitable causes. Jamie Dimon – JP Morgan Chase The most influential When Jamie Dimon speaks about the economy, the stock market, and geopolitical developments, everyone in the US listens intently. His opinion carries weight with the markets, investors, and governments of major countries. His predictions rarely miss. It was his brilliant moves that averted the collapse of Wall Street and the US financial system in the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis. A legacy that has enshrined him as by far the most influential manager, if not in the world, certainly in American finance. He has led, for the past 20 years, as chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, the leading US bank, and has repeatedly been included in Time magazine’s annual lists of the “100 most important people in the world”. One of the few managers who became billionaires by receiving staggering pay packages. For years the highest-paid CEO in the US, with an annual salary of $28 million. The 69-year-old third-generation Greek-American Dimon was born in New York to Greek immigrant children. But also bankers. Theodore’s father rose to executive vice president at American Express. Jamie studied psychology and economics at Tufts University and then at Harvard. It was there that he met his future wife Judith Kent. They married in 1983 and had three daughters. After a working stint in consulting firms, in March 2000 Dimon was appointed CEO of Bank One, then the 5th largest bank in the US. When JP Morgan Chase acquired it in July 2004, he became president and chief executive officer of the merged banks. A year later, on December 31, 2005, he became CEO of JPMC and then its chairman. An “unrepentant” banker, though the “sirens” to cross over into the political arena, even running for president, was constant, coming from both camps, Republican and Democrat. His relationship with Trump has gone through forty waves. Sometimes calm, sometimes cloudy. Same with Musk. In the campaign season (for party nominations) Trump, thinking he would support the Democrats, attempted to verbally disparage him. But quickly, when Dimon spoke sympathetically about his policies in 2017-20, he raised eyebrows. He even floated the idea of making him Treasury Secretary. He got no response. However, his key warning about the risk of stagflation in the US if the announcements of increased tariffs are implemented, the planetary leader seems to be ignoring it for now. Dimon does not forget his Greek roots. He is interested in the Greek economy, pushes investments to our country, both JP Morgan and others, and meets frequently with the current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Albert Bourla – Pfizer The businessman of the pandemic One of the most talked-about faces of the last five years, 64-year-old Albert Bourla, as the pharmaceutical company he heads, Pfizer, was the first, in partnership with BioNTech, to manufacture and distribute billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Born in Thessaloniki, of Jewish descent, he studied at Aristotle University and obtained a PhD in Biotechnology of Reproduction at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. A professorship at AUTH awaited him, but he was beaten to it by the tempting offer from Pfizer to join its staff. He set off for Athens, but after two years the journey continued to four different countries. In January 2018 he became general manager of operations, in October CEO, and in January 2020 he became executive chairman of the pharmaceutical giant. His international accolades and awards are innumerable. With his name synonymous with the battle against coronavirus, CNN chose him as Businessman of the Year, where he beat out Ilon Musk. Of all the Greek-born CEOs who excel internationally, Bourla is the best known, but also the most… Greek. He lives permanently in New York, but has a home in Halkidiki where he comes for summer vacations with his wife and their two children. Bourla has given a huge boost to Pfizer’s investment in Greece, signalling for other US giants to follow. In October 2021, Pfizer’s Global Digital Innovation Center and Global Operations and Services Center opened in Thessaloniki, creating hundreds of new jobs. Hundreds of hundreds of jobs have been created and hundreds of employees have been employed. Although under his tenure Pfizer’s profits soared, nevertheless a new minority shareholder, the Starboard Value fund, accused him months ago of bad choices that damaged the company and demanded an explanation. However, the operation to reinstate Burla failed. The major shareholders (Vanguard Group, BlackRock, etc.) of the giant fully supported the Greek CEO. Despite this, he remained among the 100 most powerful people in business, according to Fortune, and the most influential in health care, according to Time. While last April he received the American Association for Cancer Research’s Outstanding Achievement Award in San Diego, California. Ted Sarantos – Netflix From the video stores… Third-generation immigrant, Netflix strongman Ted Sarantos, was born in New Jersey and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. His grandfather had emigrated from Samos to the US, also changing his last name from Karyotakis to Sarantos. He gave up his studies in journalism at the University of Arizona to run the video store he worked at when he was in high school. He soon managed to run 8 stores until he became an executive at one of the largest videotape distribution companies in the US, East Texas. By March 2000, Sarantos was vice president of Products and Merchandise for the nearly 500-store chain. His next career move was to join Netflix, which had nothing to do with today’s global streaming giant but was simply a mail-order movie distribution company. Having met then CEO Reed Hastings in March 2000, he took over as Head of Programming and his choices proved to be the key man in its evolution into the powerful conglomerate it is today. The rest is a deafening success story. As of summer 2020, Sarantos was upgraded to co-CEO. He and his first wife Michelle had two children, film producer Sarah Sarandos and film editor Anthony Sarandos. In 2009 he married former US Ambassador to the Bahamas Nicole Avant, daughter of former Motown chairman Clarence Avant. They now live in Hancock Park, Los Angeles. A staunch Democratic supporter and interlocutor of former President Barack Obama. He frequently visits Greece for business and vacations. In July 2022, he even became the recipient of Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s desire to have a successful Greek-language series on Netflix, during a discussion at the Herodesion at an Endeavor Greece event. Among other things, the two men discussed the prospects of Greece becoming a country for film and series production. Michelle Dukeris – AB InBev The King of Beer Greek-Brazilian, eminent technocrat, currently based in Belgium and the city of Leuven, “King of Beer”. This is briefly the profile of 52-year-old Michel Dukkeris who respects and honours his motherland, namely Greece. And he often declares himself proud of his Greek roots. From July 2021 he will lead the management of the world’s largest brewery, AB InBev, with over 150,000 employees in 24 countries. Born in Lagos, Brazil, the son of a first-generation Greek immigrant, a chemical engineering graduate from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, and with a rich post-graduate background in management in the US, he joined AB InBev in 1996. He worked first in Latin America and then as the company’s head of China and Asia-Pacific for seven years. The first achievement was a 400% jump in corporate revenue. He was promoted to head of global sales and then CEO of North America, where he took the company from loss to profit. All this led him to the top of the hierarchy of the giant that has 400 brands under its umbrella, including Budweiser, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck’s, Leffe,and others. An earlier Financial Times feature on Dukkeris said he was fascinated by China’s five-year growth programs and adopted their philosophy in his business strategy. He operated the company based on a ten-year growth plan, always aiming to stay ahead of its competitors. From the result, he was vindicated. Among his major successes, he drastically cut costs to reduce the company’s debts, which when he took over the helm amounted to $80 billion. “Every dollar counts,” he says, asking every regional manager to justify every single expense, even the paper for the printer. The severe cost-cutting has saved thousands of positions for the company’s staff. It also credits the implementation of AB InBev’s first e-commerce platform, where it also increased sales.

Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said in an interview with Financial Times (FT) that he will present a bitcoin investment plan to the board on Thursday, which, if approved, could see the apex bank diversify 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves into the leading cryptocurrency by market value. "For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good," Michl said, according to an interview published by the FT and quoted by Reuters. Michl pointed to broader investor interest in the cryptocurrency since BlackRock and others debuted spot ETFs a year ago. "An asset under consideration is Bitcoin. It currently has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio. Worth considering. Right now, it’s only at the stage of analysis and discussion. The Bank Board decides, and no decision is imminent. Thoughtful analysis is needed," Michl said in a statement on X. "Bitcoin has significant volatility, which makes it harder to take advantage of its current low correlation with other assets. That’s why I will ask our team on Thursday to further assess Bitcoin’s potential role in our reserves. Nothing more, nothing less," he added.

Title: Who to watch in Ireland's U20 Six Nations campaign
URL: https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/czxkvkxznkro
Time Published: 2025-01-29T07:09:25Z
Full Content:
Eanna McCarthy, Michael Foy, Henry Walker and Ciaran Mangan at Ireland Men's U20s squad announcement Ireland will aim to banish the heartbreak of missing out on a third successive Grand Slam in this year's Under-20 Six Nations. Neil Doak has named a 31-man squad after being appointed head coach in December, with England - the team who denied them a third straight clean sweep last year - first up on 30 January. There has been a proven pathway in recent years from age-grade level to the senior side. Look no further than Sam Prendergast, a player who won a Grand Slam with the under-20s in 2023 and now finds himself fighting for Ireland's 10 jersey in this year's Six Nations. As we look ahead to this year's tournament, BBC Sport NI picks five players who might catch the eye for Ireland's youngsters. Eanna McCarthy will captain Ireland at this year's U20's Six Nations Championship Province: Connacht Club: Galwegians Age: 19 Position: Back row While he may be a new face in the side, and donning the title of captain, Eanna McCarthy is no stranger to responsibility. Before heading to the west coast over the summer to join the Connacht academy, Cork native McCarthy captained the Munster Under-19s through their 2024 campaign, defeating both Ulster and Connacht. At club level, McCarthy has been a regular name on the team sheet for Galwegians RFC, who play in the All-Ireland League [AIL] Division 2B. Alongside his leadership qualities, McCarthy is praised for his work rate on and off the ball, bringing physicality in his attack and defence, something which Doak will look to utilise throughout the campaign. Alex Usanov played for Emerging Ireland in October's tour of South Africa Province: Leinster Club: Clontarf Age: 19 Position: Prop Alex Usanov is one of the six members in the current squad who returns to the fold for a second consecutive year, and it is fair to say he's been busy since then. A player credited for his physicality and power in the scrum, the Leinster academy prop was included in the Emerging Ireland squad in October, gaining valuable minutes and experience along the way against three tough South African sides. For the past two seasons, Usanov's had huge involvement at AIL Division 1A side Clontarf, and his contribution's have been crucial in the sides challenge for top spot. They currently sit two points behind league leaders St. Mary's College. Some years before his rise in Irish Rugby, Usanov was a successful martial arts competitor. He became All-Ireland champion for Judo in 2018 and 2019, a sport which he believes taught him different disciplines. Hooker Henry Walker returns for a second year hoping to claim an U20 Six Nations medal Province: Ulster Club: Queen's University Age: 19 Position: Hooker Another returning face to the side is hooker Henry Walker. Just like his front row partner Usanov, Walker was involved in last year's Championship, and was unlucky to miss out on selection for the Junior World Cup last summer due to injury. The former Hartpury College player has progressed into year two of the Academy at Ulster and has impressed in appearances for his local side QUB who find themselves seventh in AIL Division 1B. A dynamic hooker who plays a physical game with or without the ball, he too shows the qualities of a leader having captained the under-20s to a win in a friendly against Italy in December. He will no doubt look to push Ireland all the way this time after narrowly missing out last year. Leinster academy centre Connor Fahy splits the Italian defence in a friendly Province: Leinster Club: Clontarf Age: 19 Position: Centre A product of his local team Wexford Wanderers, Connor Fahy is certainly an exciting prospect. Playing for club side Clontarf in AIL Division 1A, Fahy provides a powerful outlet at Doak's disposal in the centre of the pitch. As another graduate of the Leinster academy, Fahy featured in the IRFU 150th 'A' Interprovincial Championship last November against Munster 'A'. Versatility is a key component to his game, with the capability to cover inside and outside centre. As physical player who promises to cross the gainline, there is no doubt he can create a problem for defenders. Ciaran Mangan faced his brother in a pre-tournament friendly December Province: Leinster Club: Blackrock College Age: 19 Position: Centre A versatile back who can cover centre and both wings, Ciaran Mangan is expected to cause plenty of problems for any opposition. Credited for his electric pace on the ball, accompanied with a strong work ethic, Mangan has also found himself in the centre of the park for AIL Division 1B side Blackrock College. This type of flexibility might be of use to Doak, who may look to deploy a player of Mangan's quality across the backline, rather than tying him to one position. Another product of the Leinster Academy, Ciaran faced his older brother Diarmuid in a final warm-up game against Leinster 'A' ahead of Doak's squad announcement. Diarmuid, who has featured for the Leinster senior team over the past two seasons, was involved with the under-20s side who won back to back Grand Slams in 2022 and 2023.

(Reuters) - Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said that he will present a plan to the central bank's board to invest in bitcoin and added that it was "very likely" the bank would cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week, according to an interview published by the Financial Times on Wednesday. Michl said he will present the plan to the board on Thursday, and if approved, the bank could eventually hold as much as 5% of its 140 billion euro ($146.13 billion) reserves in bitcoin, according to the FT. "For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” he said. He added that bitcoin would trend higher even without the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump since it's an alternative investment for many people. Bitcoin hit a record high earlier this month when Trump, who has pledged to be a "crypto president," was sworn in. It has more than doubled in value in 2024, driven by the U.S. market regulator's approval for exchange-traded funds tied to its spot price, and optimism over easing regulatory hurdles under Trump. Michl, too, highlighted wider investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other firms last year launched bitcoin exchange traded funds, according to the FT.

Title: Continuity Sinn Féin the order of the day as Mary Lou McDonald sticks with her tried and trusted

The great purge of Parnell Square turned out to be a weak Milk of Magnesia effort in the end. In an interview before Christmas, Mary Lou McDonald promised a “significant reshuffle” at parliamentary party level come the new year. “Nobody is in a position indefinitely,” declared the woman who became leader of Sinn Féin once Gerry Adams decided to step down after 34 years in charge. Certainly, her party has never been found wanting over the years when justifying why nobody is indispensable. So news she was about to announce her new front bench prompted much speculation about blood on the carpet in Kevin Barry Memorial Hall. That struggle never materialised. Reports of a big clear-out of familiar faces were greatly exaggerated. It seems Mary Lou was gilding the Easter Lily when she made her Yuletide prediction. The new front bench is remarkably like the old one. Having feasted on the red meat of Dáil Éireann in tumult last week, political reporters had been hoping she could keep the carnage going with this “significant” switcheroo. But all she delivered was a minor tweaking of the usual cast of characters. Longford-Westmeath’s Sorca Clarke was the only one dropped while two first-time deputies – Donna McGettigan (Clare) and Joanna Byrne (Louth) – joined the team. Consolation may come soon for erstwhile frontbencher Sorca. “When the Government appoints junior spokespersons we will follow suit,” said her leader during Tuesday’s disappointing unveiling in the Alex Hotel near Leinster House. The list of new Minister of State is out on Wednesday. This should bring some relief to a nation battling to cope with the aftermath of Storm Éowyn while simultaneously fretting over who will get what consolation prize for missing out on a seat at the Cabinet table. Or maybe not. Because, let’s face it, nobody is that bothered. So back to Mary Lou and her still in situ stalwarts, who found themselves in this hotel meeting room at the last minute because rain forced them to abandon plans to hold the event outside on the Leinster House plinth. But in a nice twist, the four-star Alex is situated on Fenian Street. So they felt very much at home. Not to be outdone by the Shinners, the new Coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Michael Lowry’s leg is now frantically searching for a venue on Tribunal Street, Balls-up Boulevard or Audacity Avenue to host its ceremonial roll-out of the Juniors. On Fenian Street, there was wasn’t enough time to set out tables for display purposes so the new old front bench stood in two lines in the middle of the parquet floor behind Mary Lou. There was more than enough space for everyone to launch into an impromptu Walls of Limerick. Instead, the party leader took to a small lectern and made a “simple pledge to the working people of Ireland”. An evocative reminder of the working people stood at the end of the first line. For it was Eoin Ó Broin, the party’s Blackrock College educated spokesman on housing, poignantly wearing the honest workwear of the toiling Irish navvy from the last century – a black donkey-jacket with distinctive leatherette patches on each shoulder. [ The Michael Lowry issue is still unresolved and may escalate. GUBU’s the word for itOpens in new window ] English comedians of old used to joke about Paddy being asked the meaning of the word “fascinate”. And Paddy would say “Oi, I have 10 buttons on me donkey-jacket but I can only fasten eight”. Mary Lou’s simple pledge to the working people was to guarantee that Sinn Féin “will be up and at it from day one, working for you, non-stop”. As for Eoin, the toil never stops either. He kept his portfolio in the mini-shuffle as did high-profile performers Pearse O’Doherty (finance), David Cullinane (health), Mairéad O’Farrell (public expenditure and reform) and Claire Kerrane (children, disability and equality). Sinn Féin’s top team may have hit the ground running, but Mary Lou called out the Government for going straight into a two-week recess as soon as it was reinstalled after the long break for Christmas and the general election. Why do they need extra-time to familiarise themselves with the job? “They have no excuse now: they’ve been in Government forever. At least it feels like forever.” But never mind. Sinn Féin will get straight down to business when they “come back off their holibops”. In the meantime, the row over the Regional Independent group and its controversial Stroke Whisperer demanding Opposition speaking time rumbles on. “Michael Lowry simply will not be allowed to masquerade as an Opposition TD,” said the Sinn Féin leader, stressing that the combined Opposition remains firmly united on this issue. And speaking of working together, what does she make of the call from Labour’s Ivana Bacik for parties on the left to consider nominating an agreed candidate to contest the presidential election later this year? “It would make sense to have a joint approach, if that’s possible,” said Mary Lou. But the party has yet to discuss finding a successor to Michael D Higgins. “Who ever gets elected will have big shoes to fill.” Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Elon Musk, head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is exploring the use of blockchain technology to track and manage U.S. government expenditures, aiming to enhance transparency, secure data, streamline payments and build management. This initiative aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability, building on proposals like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 idea to put the entire federal budget on a blockchain for public scrutiny. DOGE officially launched on Jan. 21, with the goal of modernizing federal technology and software. The department, created by an executive order from President Trump, is tasked with identifying spending cuts and delivering recommendations by July 4, 2026. While blockchain offers potential benefits, experts warn of the complexities and challenges in applying it to a large, complex entity like the U.S. government. Issues include loss of control with public blockchains and the sufficiency of conventional databases for similar tasks. Despite concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain for specific purposes, such as the California DMV and BlackRock. If DOGE proceeds, it would be the largest government blockchain project in U.S. history, reflecting the administration's commitment to using advanced technology to tackle inefficiency and waste.

If DOGE proceeds, it would be the largest government blockchain project in U.S. history, reflecting the administration's commitment to using advanced technology to tackle inefficiency and waste. In a bold move to modernize federal operations and curb wasteful spending, Elon Musk, head of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is reportedly exploring using blockchain technology to track and manage U.S. government expenditures. According to sources familiar with the discussions, the initiative aims to enhance transparency, secure sensitive data, streamline payments and build management. This effort aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability in government operations. The discussions, which have included consultations with representatives from public blockchain networks, mark a significant step in the Trump administration's push to integrate digital assets into federal systems. While the initiative is still in its early stages, it has already sparked debate about the feasibility and necessity of using blockchain for such large-scale government projects. The idea of leveraging blockchain technology to increase government transparency is not new. In April 2024, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed putting the entire federal budget on a blockchain, allowing citizens to scrutinize every expenditure in real-time. "Every American can look at every budget item in the entire budget, anytime they want, 24 hours a day," Kennedy told a rally in Michigan. "We are going to have 300 million eyeballs on our budget. If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody will know about it." Kennedy's proposal resonated with small-government advocates and fiscal conservatives, who have long criticized the federal government's unchecked spending. Musk's initiative appears to build on this momentum, with the DOGE exploring how blockchain could be used not only to track spending but also to secure data, facilitate payments and manage federal infrastructure. DOGE takes its first steps The DOGE officially launched its website on Jan. 21, adopting the logo of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired its name. The move caused a brief surge in Dogecoin's price, which rose approximately 11 percent to $0.38 following the announcement. However, the department's mission extends far beyond memes and cryptocurrencies. Created by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, DOGE is tasked with modernizing federal technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity. The department is expected to work closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget to identify spending cuts and deliver recommendations by July 4, 2026. Musk has already enlisted about 100 volunteers to write code for his projects, signaling his commitment to rapid implementation. The blockchain initiative is one of several technological tools being considered to reduce costs, eliminate fraud and address the ballooning federal deficit â a key issue Trump campaigned on in 2024. While the potential benefits of blockchain technology are clear, experts caution that applying it to an entity as vast and complex as the U.S. government is uncharted territory. Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized millions of car titles on the Avalanche blockchain and BlackRock has issued a money-market fund on several cryptocurrency ledgers. If DOGE moves forward with its blockchain initiative, it would represent the largest government project of its kind in U.S. history. The effort underscores the Trump administration's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to address longstanding issues of inefficiency and waste. (Related: Bitcoin's bull run may extend into 2025, but regulatory shifts and market indicators suggest caution.) However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Previous attempts by large corporations to implement blockchain solutions have often stalled due to governance issues and the discovery that existing database technologies are often more cost-effective. As Hammond noted, "The question is whether you really need a blockchain to do that, since conventional databases can be used in a similar way and with fewer downsides."

DOGE takes its first steps The DOGE officially launched its website on Jan. 21, adopting the logo of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired its name. The move caused a brief surge in Dogecoin's price, which rose approximately 11 percent to $0.38 following the announcement. However, the department's mission extends far beyond memes and cryptocurrencies. Created by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, DOGE is tasked with modernizing federal technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity. The department is expected to work closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget to identify spending cuts and deliver recommendations by July 4, 2026. Musk has already enlisted about 100 volunteers to write code for his projects, signaling his commitment to rapid implementation. The blockchain initiative is one of several technological tools being considered to reduce costs, eliminate fraud and address the ballooning federal deficit â a key issue Trump campaigned on in 2024. While the potential benefits of blockchain technology are clear, experts caution that applying it to an entity as vast and complex as the U.S. government is uncharted territory. Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized millions of car titles on the Avalanche blockchain and BlackRock has issued a money-market fund on several cryptocurrency ledgers. If DOGE moves forward with its blockchain initiative, it would represent the largest government project of its kind in U.S. history. The effort underscores the Trump administration's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to address longstanding issues of inefficiency and waste. (Related: Bitcoin's bull run may extend into 2025, but regulatory shifts and market indicators suggest caution.) However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Previous attempts by large corporations to implement blockchain solutions have often stalled due to governance issues and the discovery that existing database technologies are often more cost-effective. As Hammond noted, "The question is whether you really need a blockchain to do that, since conventional databases can be used in a similar way and with fewer downsides."

Title: JOHN STOSSEL: Woke ESG Culture Going Down In Flames During Trump Era

Time Published: 2025-01-29T02:18:54Z

“Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!'” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential climate envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism — producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

Title: Ondo to Bring Tokenized US Treasurys to XRPL
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/ondo-to-bring-tokenized-us-treasurys-to-xrpl/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T23:53:19Z

Ondo Finance said Tuesday (Jan. 28) that it will bring tokenized U.S. Treasurys to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This collaboration will offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), which are backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and can be instantaneously minted and redeemed at any time using the Ripple USD (RLUSD) U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, the companies said in a Tuesday (Jan. 28) press release. “This integration is the natural convergence of a compliance-first, yield-bearing product with a network purpose-built for institutional adoption, setting the groundwork for forward-thinking institutions to lead a new era of capital markets onchain,” Ondo Finance Vice President of Partnerships Katie Wheeler said in the release. Ondo and Ripple have secured commitments to seed OUSG liquidity upon deployment, according to the release. The companies’ collaboration will meet institutional demand for tokenized U.S. Treasurys that offer liquidity, efficiency and transparency in capital markets, the release said. Bringing OUSG to XRPL will provide a solution that provides institutional-grade security, accessible liquidity, and seamless tokenization and trading of real-world assets (RWAs), per the release. “The 24/7 intraday settlement enabled by tokenized assets like OUSG marks a transformative shift in capital flow management, breaking free from traditional trading hours and slow settlements,” Markus Infanger, senior vice president, RippleX, said in the release. The tokenization of RWAs has captured the imaginations of various players across payments, finance and commerce because it has the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient, PYMNTS reported last April. Ripple and Archax extended their existing collaboration in June, saying they aimed to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of tokenized RWAs onto XRPL. Because Archax works with financial institutions to enable them to tokenize their financial RWAs, the collaboration will allow those institutions to select the XRPL to do so. In February, Ondo Finance and Aptos Foundation partnered on the integration of RWAs with blockchain technology, beginning with the integration of Ondo’s tokenized U.S. Treasurys product, USDY, onto the Aptos blockchain. The partnership also sets the stage for a series of financial products using the strengths of the two organizations. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

(“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK), is announcing that the iShares Convertible Bond Index ETF (the “iShares ETF”) is expected to experience higher than normal portfolio turnover as a result of upcoming changes to the composition of the FTSE Canada Convertible Bond Index (the “Index”).

LAST UPDATE | 28 Jan CORK GAA HAVE responded to RTÉ’s claim that the county ‘could not accommodate’ televised coverage of Saturday night’s hurling league showdown with Limerick. Rebels officials have revealed that the Division 1A fixture was not chosen for TV coverage at its designated throw-in time of 7.30pm, and that they were asked to bring the game forward to facilitate broadcasters. Cork say that they declined to do so on the basis that the game would then clash with Ireland’s Six Nations opener against England, which kicks off at 4.45pm on Saturday. Over 20,000 tickets have been sold for the game with only terrace tickets at the Blackrock End still available. The game is not scheduled for live TV or streaming coverage, with RTÉ showing Armagh against Tyrone in Division 1 of the football league at 6pm, while TG4 have Donegal against Dublin in football live at 7.30pm. Earlier on Tuesday, RTÉ said that they “sought Cork-Limerick in the Allianz Hurling League as our match selection a number of months ago but the counties could not accommodate. Advertisement “RTÉ subsequently chose Armagh-Tyrone.” Cork CEO Kevin O’Donovan said: “Having been particularly surprised to hear from Croke Park a number of weeks ago that Cork v Limerick was not to be the chosen game by broadcasters at the appointed time on Saturday, February 1st @7.30pm, we were then asked if we wished to consider changing our game to an earlier time to facilitate broadcast. “As this alternative time clashed directly with the Ireland v England Rugby game on the same evening, we sought not to deprive our own supporters of seeing both games. “We remain disappointed that our fixture will not be televised at the appointed time, but look forward to another spectacle with a packed house here at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Saturday next.” RTÉ sought Cork-Limerick in the Allianz Hurling League as our match selection a number of months ago but the counties could not accommodate.

RTÉ subsequently chose Armagh-Tyrone. The combined capacity of the North Stand and South Stand at Páirc Uí Chaoimh is for 21,000 spectators, which will see the game surpass the 19,516 that attended the last league fixture between the counties at the stadium in February 2023, when Cork won out 2-17 to 0-22. In February 2020, when the teams met on a Sunday afternoon at the stadium in the league, Limerick defeated Cork 0-29 to 2-21 before a crowd of 11,212. Both encounters between the two sides in championship last summer were epic games before sellout crowds, a contributory factor towards the heightened anticipation for this league fixture.

Title: [US] Honor Your Elders with Celebration During Lunar Festival

Every year, the druids of Moonglade celebrate their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts…and, of course, lighting fireworks. The celebration has begun in Moonglade, and your Lunar Festival Invitation is waiting. Join in the fun by dressing up in your Lunar Festival finery, launching fireworks, and paying homage to the Elders throughout Azeroth. When: January 28–February 11 Where: Moonglade, with camps in Ironforge, Stormwind, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Dragon Isles zones, Khaz Algar zones, and the Undercity Currency: Coin of Ancestry Khaz Algar is joining in Lunar New Year festivities as eight new Elders (two per zone) make their way to the island, bringing with them a new Achievement, "Elders of Khaz Algar," and a new reward for trading in Coins of Ancestry, the Lunar Launcher. "It's always a festival when you are on the Lunar Launcher." The Lunar Festival is a time of celebration for the peoples of Azeroth. At the beginning of each year, elders of generations past manifest around the world to impart their wisdom upon all who listen. Should you encounter these venerable spirits in your travels and take the time to heed their words, they may even pass along tokens of their gratitude—Coins of Ancestry, the lessons of a past age in physical form. Gather enough Coins of Ancestry and the Cenarion Circle will open their stores of celebratory garb, fireworks, trinkets, and recipes! The Cenarion Circle has good cause to celebrate, for the Lunar Festival marks the return of many Ancients that fell in battles past: Goldrinn, Malorne, Aviana, and Cenarius himself. But this celebration is darkened by the eternal torment of one of their own—Omen, a wolf Ancient blessed by the moon goddess Elune, has risen from the depths of Moonglade’s lake. Though Omen was once as noble and proud as any Ancient, he was driven mad by the Burning Legion’s tainted magics during the War of the Ancients. Omen’s immortality means that he is forever cursed to return in his maddened state at the advent of each new year—and this year, he has grown further in power. Heroes level 20 and above must make haste to ease this tormented Ancient’s suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year he will return with a clearer mind. The great wolf Omen was once a hero of this world. An embodiment of strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the War of the Ancients until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across Azeroth, leaving death and terror in his wake. Omen was finally defeated in Moonglade, and he now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. But each year, at the beginning of the festival, he stirs... The celebration begins with an introductory quest, The Lunar Festival. The Cenarion Circle has invited all denizens of Azeroth to take part in the celebration of the Lunar Festival. You can learn more about the event by meeting with the Lunar Festival Harbinger. It wouldn’t be a celebration without fireworks. You’ll be asked to buy some Lunar Fireworks and Cluster Fireworks to launch and complete the quest Lunar Fireworks. Once you’ve proven your pyrotechnic prowess, you’ll receive your Lunar Festival Invitation to travel to Moonglade and speak with Valadar Starsong in Nighthaven. With your invitation in hand, you’ll be able to travel quickly to Moonglade by standing within Greater Moonlight throughout the holiday. The Lunar Festival features 18 achievements and one meta-achievement. It's a good time to travel Azeroth, see the sights, and pay your respects to the various Elders. Visiting an Elder will reward reputation with select capital cities, a Coin of Ancestry, some experience and gold, and a Lucky Red Envelope. *Speak with Myrael Lunarbloom in Moonglade to take the quest Lunar Preservation. You'll be tasked with visiting various moonwells around Azeroth to charge her staff. Upon completion of the quest, you'll earn 25 Coins of Ancestry which you can use to purchase one of four floral crowns (only wearable during Lunar Festival) from Valadar Starsong. Once you've purchased a crown, a new quest will become available, allowing you to earn a new version of the crown. This new crown is then added to your transmog appearances once the quest is complete allowing you to wear this crown year-round. Once all of the crowns are purchased, the associated quests become available to all characters on your account. A WoW Classic version of the Lunar Festival is also available for those seeking to honor their Elders throughout Azeroth. Look for the Lunar Festival Emissary in any capital city to kick off the celebration. When: January 28 - February 18 Where: Any capital city. Fashionable Lunar Festival Emissaries are eager to help direct you to Lunar Festival Harbingers found in each capital city. Complete the Lunar Festival World Quests to earn the "To Honor One's Elders" meta-achievement as part of the "What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been" achievement.

Scorelines can be so deceiving as Blackrock College were given a severe test by St Mary’s in the Leinster Schools Senior Cup first round at Energia Park on Tuesday. The holders were rocked back on their heels from the start as St Mary’s flowed forward to establish a lineout. Joseph Christle burst through the first tackle to go close and Eoghan Brady was on hand to complete the mission. Paul Neary converted in the fourth minute to make it 7-0 to the Rathmines school. Blackrock spurned all chances to kick at goal, preferring to use the maul to cause chaos, not before Brady bundled James Browne into touch at the corner flag. It came as no surprise to see hooker Harry O’Neill rise to claim a try from a powerful drive in the 15th minute. A simple, clever throw to the front of another Blackrock lineout put Conal Power through one-on-one, but O’Neill couldn’t take the pass. It was a thing of beauty to see frontrowers Patrick Tuite and Christle handling like backs in the lead-up to a penalty for offside. Neary knocked it over to put St Mary’s 10-5 ahead in the 25th minute. Another penalty led to a lineout and after Power plucked the throw from the air, O’Neill was in the van to deliver the try for to level the scores at 10-10 in the 28th minute. But Blackrock would take a 15-10 advantage into half-time after Bernard White bolted into the clear to score. There was an extended stalemate brokered before a case of obstruction allowed Mary’s outhalf Neary to split the posts from distance to make it 15-13 in the 50th minute. It would be their last score as soon after Paddy Clancy grubbered and gathered to find Johnny O’Sullivan on his inside shoulder for a stunning try, converted by Clancy to put Rock 22-13 up in the 59th minute. It was appropriate Michael O’Sullivan should have the decisive say with the fifth try, converted by Clancy, before Browne cut loose from inside his half to give the scoreboard a very flattering complexion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw $1.9 billion in weekly inflows as Trump’s pro-market stance fueled investor enthusiasm and momentum. In the first week of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, the U.S. witnessed an extraordinary surge in investment activity, with approximately $1.9 billion funneled into spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This influx reflects the growing momentum behind the so-called “Trump Trade” phenomenon, as investors rally around the administration’s pro-market stance. According to SoSoValue data, BTC ETFs recorded $517.67 million in net inflows by the 24th of January, contributing to $1.76 billion total for the week—extending the $1.96 billion influx observed before Trump’s inauguration. The week closed strongly for Bitcoin ETFs, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading by securing $186.07 million in net inflows on the 24th Jof anuary. This pushed its cumulative inflows to $13.04 billion, elevating its net assets to $22.5 billion. FBTC now stands as the second-best-performing Bitcoin fund. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB followed closely, attracting $168.71 million in net inflows, bringing its total to $2.96 billion, with net assets of $5.41 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT dominated the BTC ETF landscape, amassing $155.69 million in inflows. This drove its cumulative inflows to $39.73 billion, securing $60.62 billion in net assets. Smaller contributions came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, recording $13.01 million, and the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW), posting $2.79 million. The only outlier was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, experiencing $8.6 million in outflows, contrasting the otherwise bullish sentiment. Ethereum ETFs experienced modest gains last week, with $9.18 million in net inflows, bringing the cumulative total for the week to $139.32 million. This followed a more robust pre-inauguration week, which saw $211.97 million in inflows. Interestingly, top performers like BlackRock and Fidelity were notably absent from the day’s results, leaving room for smaller funds to take the spotlight. Leading the charge, Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF (ETHW) secured $6.01 million in inflows, boosting its cumulative total to $351.69 million. Other funds like the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH) and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) also saw modest inflows of $1.99 million and $1.17 million, respectively. This subdued performance has raised questions about ETH’s positioning compared to BTC, which appears to be drawing more attention from investors as a safer or more promising bet. Nonetheless, Ethereum ETFs have seen substantial institutional interest, attracting over $5 billion since November 2024. With use cases in DeFi and tokenized assets, Ethereum’s potential continues to offer diverse opportunities, positioning it for long-term growth despite current market fluctuations. As ETH ETFs continue to gain traction, they may exert pressure on Bitcoin’s dominance, especially as institutions explore Ethereum’s broader applications. However, the latest data from Farside Investors shows that both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs faced outflows on the 27th of January. Bitcoin saw $456.7 million in exits, while Ethereum ETF shed $136.2 million. This raises questions about whether the bullish trend triggered by the Trump administration will be sustained or prove short-lived. Therefore, the evolution of these ETFs remains uncertain. Investors will be closely watching to see if the recent momentum continues or stalls.

Title: The World's Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges

Christmas came early for bitcoin this year. On the back of record-breaking launches of ETFs backed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, which have accumulated $112 billion in bitcoin, and president Donald Trump’s reelection in November, the digital asset crossed $100,000. Enthusiasts are expecting 2025 to be more bullish as a pro-crypto congress is coming in power with promises to finally pass regulation that will move the industry out of the proverbial penalty box. Hype cycles like this create unbridled optimism, and a healthy dose of FOMO, but investors should proceed with caution. And this does not mean which tokens one chooses to speculate in. There are hundreds of crypto exchanges in the world - essentially retail brokerage firms - with fancy websites, attractive features, and yield propositions and promises to keep your money safe. But all crypto exchanges and marketplaces are not created equal. There are significant differences between the types and number of licenses they hold and how they safeguard your digital assets. Anyone who was burned by the collapse of FTX in 2022 knows how important that can be. Additionally, not every exchange provides the same trading opportunities or charges the same amount. The top firm on Forbes’ third annual Best Crypto Exchange ranking, which analyzed more than 200 firms, is $85 billion Chicago-based CME Group. While this giant futures exchange, founded in 1898 to trade butter and eggs, is not suitable for most retail investors, we gave it high scores because in the wild and wooly world of crypto, safety is paramount and the CME Group is highly regulated by the CFTC. While crypto is still a tiny part of what is traded at CME, during 2024 it traded $1.4 trillion in futures contracts for digital assets such as bitcoin or ether. CME Group offers such things as Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures and options, with minimums of $300 for the smallest of futures contracts, that customers can gain access to via traditional brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and Fidelity. When it comes to retail oriented exchanges $70 billion (market cap) Coinbase earned the #2 spot in the rankings. Coinbase is the only major publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. and its customers pay more for this perceived safety in fees and transaction costs. Thanks to some 8 million active accounts, it is the largest custodian of bitcoin in the world, holding 2.4 million worth a staggering $245 billion at current price levels. Asset safety is the most important feature exchange customers demand according to our survey of retail crypto trade. UK-based Bitstamp, a global exchange with a significant presence in Europe, came in third, with Binance (the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume) coming in fourth and Menlo Park-headquartered Robinhood, which is predominantly oriented toward stocks and options, taking fifth place. Robinhood, long criticized for gamifying investing to attract a youthful audience, has become something of a meme headquarters holding $15 billion worth of DOGE coin for clients (Shiba Inu inspired token) and added “dogwifhat” to a list that includes Shiba Inu, PEPE, and BONK. Besides meme coins, Robinhood acquired Luxembourg-based cryptoexchange Bitstamp last July for approximately $200 million, with the firms continuing to operate separately pending the necessary board approvals in the coming months. This acquisition may be the start of a consolidation trend for this highly fragmented industry as the most successful firms attempt to break out from their regional focus. Binance, absent during last year’s rankings due to legal wranglings, continues to be a dominant firm. It claims to have 245 million registered users and its average daily spot trading volume of around $14 billion represents almost a quarter of the $62 billion. The next biggest exchange, Dubai-based Bybit, only has $8.2 billion. Coinbase has an average daily crypto trading volume of $5.3 billion. Binance’s new management team promises to focus more on compliance, which would be a boon for the crypto compliance sector. The remaining firms in the ranking include some of the most prominent worldwide. In the U.S., leading firms include Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com, and Fidelity. In South Korea, the two major firms are Upbit and Bithumb, while in Japan, they are Bitbank, bitFlyer, and Coincheck, and in Europe, we recognize Revolut, bitpanda, and Bitvavo. Together, these firms hold an estimated $1.2 trillion in client assets, and, according to the web analytics firm Similarweb, their websites were frequented by a combined 438 million users in November. Below, please find the 2025 rankings. Many investors prioritize low fees when deciding where to trade crypto. Most exchanges post their prices for sellers or purchasers online, respectively known as “maker” and “taker” fees; but they do not tell the whole story. Traders also need to be aware of a term called spread, which is the difference between a quoted buying and selling prices in an orderbook. The size of the spread varies by exchange and trading pair, but a general rule of thumb is that platforms with high volume have lower spreads. And vice versa. Our research revealed that the weighted cost of execution in the crypto market among ranked firms today, and inclusive of spread, is 80 basis points. To do this analysis we used the cost of trading reported by crypto providers to us or via their website, plus average spread information from CoinGecko. The specific test looked at what it would cost to purchase $25,000 of crypto without any volume discounts or other promotions. While trading fees can be relatively easily controlled, spread is a function of a provider’s overall liquidity. Among ranked firms, the average spread was 64 basis points (bp), with Upbit, Coincheck, and Bitstamp averaging 241bp, 181bp, and 143bp, respectively, as the costliest firms.[ One hundred basis points is the equivalent of one percentage point.] Coinbase’s 19bp spread was among the lowest and slightly bested Binance’s 21bp. There is a lot of variance among firm, if a trader wants to know the cheapest place to buy or sell crypto, it is important to evanluate both the posted fees and spread together. Source: Forbes, CoinGecko, company websites The chart above shows both fees and spreads and demonstrates that the biggest exchanges by market share tend to have the lowest trading cost, with the exception of Coinbase. Robinhood, which caters to retail traders, has a zero-fee trading model but the numbers above fail to incorporate the spreads,which in Robinhood’s case are a core part of their business model since they sell order flow. U.S. exchanges with more than a decade of crypto service such as Coinbase and Kraken continue to enjoy high demand despite higher trading costs. Eventually fee compression from competition from firms like Robinhood could drive fees down. There are several firms that have both expensive and cheap alternatives for heavy users, and Coinbase and Revolut are perfect examples. Coinbase retail clients averaged fees of 126 basis points. But in an effort to retain low-volume but high fee-paying clients the company created a monthly subscription service called Coinbase One that would eliminate fees. Prices range between $30-$300/month depending on volume. A majority of Revolut clients trade using their traditional app and pay 249bp on average, but the firm launched a web platform called Revolut X in select countries late last year that is priced at 10 basis points per trade and is gaining heavy traction. By Forbes measurement, there were no less than half a billion crypto users globally at the end of 2024. We enlisted the help of web analytics firm SimilarWeb, to help us determine where the most crypto traders were. The map below gives an estimation of the geographic dispersion of crypto investors. Forbes with similarweb data The largest concentration of traders is in the Asia-Pacific region, which has 160 million visitors. Europe was next with 134 million. The US and Canada added another 56 million. Latin America and the Caribbean had 40 million traders, and Africa was the lowest at 18 million. Traffic to crypto providers is highly concentrated, with 12 ranked firms and 3 unranked firms each having 10+ million unique visitors. Firms like Binance, Crypto.com, and Bitget prominently display the number of “users” on their website in the tens or hundreds of millions, without defining the term. These firms, along with many others surveyed for this study, did not provide up to date figures on active accounts. However, monthly SimilarWeb data provides a clearer picture and approximate number of users that is consistent across all exchanges. This analysis reveals that Binance, for example, had 75 million unique users (17% of the total) compared to Coinbase’s 56 million (13%). Robinhood was fourth at 37 million. But aside from these major global exchanges, there are some providers that focus on just one or two domiciles. The 49 million traders in South Korea are primarily serviced by two major institutions, Bithumb and Upbit, who received a combined total of 70% of all crypto exchange visitors. Much of the remainder went to larger offshore exchanges like Binance, ByBit, and Bitget. While these exchanges are ranked, none are actually licensed to operate in South Korea. The top three firms servicing Japan's 16 million visitors are Bitflyer, Coincheck, and Bitbank, while Germany’s 15 million go to Austria-based Bitpanda along with Bitget, and Binance. In India, Binance is the biggest exchange, accounting for essentially all of the of the country’s 6 million monthly visitors. The biggest local exchange operating in the south-Asian country is CoinDCX, which received 1.1 million visitors. Turning to Latin America, Brazil’s 14 million visitors primarily went to Binance, Singapore-based Gate.io (which has a sponsorship deal with soccer star Lionel Messi), and Coinbase. Finally, because Russia continues to be under US sanctions, American exchanges like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken do not have a presence in those countries. Given its 18 million monthly users, Russia remains a major crypto trading hub. The biggest destinations are ByBit (6.7 million), HTX (3.5 million), and Binance (2.4 million). Ed Note: This article has been updated to clarify certain facts about Fidelity Crypto, including that it considers itself to be a marketplace rather than an exchange.

Title: UK Circling the Drain – Crisis what Crisis?
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/uk-circling-the-drain-crisis-what-crisis/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
EditorEconomy Kit Knightly, OffGuardian It is now almost five years since the start of the COVID event. The public was told there was a deadly disease that would affect the entire population, and everyone was at risk. However, in order to truly understand COVID, that event must be situated within a framework that examines the underlying economic determinants. In fact, many on the “left” are notable for having failed to undertake such an analysis and merely capitulated to the mainstream narrative. The COVID event had little if anything to do with public health. It was a policy mechanism deployed to manage an impending financial crisis. COVID policies served as a pretext for halting economic activity in a controlled manner to address systemic contradictions within neoliberal capitalism. Unprecedented fiscal and monetary interventions were strategic tools to stabilise the economy and prevent a deeper collapse of financial markets. The lockdowns, framed as public health necessities, effectively suspended economic activity in ways that allowed capital to regroup and restructure. This included consolidating corporate power (e.g. through increased reliance on digital platforms), and creating conditions for new rounds of capital investment post-crisis, facilitated by a convenient debt crisis and World Bank loans with pro-neoliberal strings-attached conditionalities. The framing of COVID-19 as a health crisis obscured its role in facilitating economic restructuring under the guise of emergency management. It also helped promote the notion of a benign, well-intentioned state that really cares about the well-being of the population. Neoliberalism has dominated economic thought since the late 20th century, characterised by deregulation, privatisation and a focus on market-driven solutions. This framework led to systemic failures, particularly evident in the lead-up to the COVID event. Financial markets were on the brink of collapse immediately prior to COVID. Quantitative easing (QE) had been put in overdrive following the financial crisis of 2008. QE was used as a tool to prop up a failing system. What we saw following the 2008 crash was ordinary people being pushed further to the edge. We witnessed more than a decade of ‘austerity’ in the UK, a neoliberal assault on the living conditions of ordinary people carried out under the guise of reining in public debt following the bank bail outs. During that period, a leading UN poverty expert compared the Conservative government’s welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and warned that, unless austerity is ended, the UK’s poorest people face lives that are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”. Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, accused ministers of being in a state of denial about the impact of policies. He accused them of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population”. In a 2019 report, the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank laid the blame for more than 130,000 deaths in the UK since 2012 at the door of government policies. It claimed that these deaths could have been prevented if improvements in public health policy had not stalled as a direct result of austerity cuts. And in a report on poverty in the UK by Professor David Gordon of the University of Bristol, it was found that almost 18 million could not afford adequate housing conditions, 12 million were too poor to engage in common social activities, one in three could not afford to heat their homes adequately in winter and four million children and adults were not properly fed (Britain’s population is estimated at around 66 million). Meanwhile, The Equality Trust in 2018 reported that the ‘austerity years’ were just fine for the richest 1,000 people in the UK. They had increased their wealth by £66 billion in one year alone (2017-2018), by £274 billion in five years (2013-2018) and had increased their total wealth to £724 billion – significantly more than the poorest 40% of households combined (£567 billion). And in early 2020, all this hardship was to be compounded by lockdowns to avert another financial meltdown. After treating millions of ordinary people as described above, we were informed that the elite now wanted to save everyone by locking them up and injecting them! Looking at Europe, investigative journalist Michael Byrant says that €1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the financial crisis in Europe alone in 2020. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. Byrant stated that all talk about big finance bankrupting the nation (again) by looting public funds, politicians destroying public services at the behest of large investors and the depredations of the casino economy was conveniently washed away with COVID. He adds that predators who saw their financial empires coming apart resolved to shut down society. To solve the problems they created, they needed a cover story, which appeared in the form of a ‘novel virus’. The European Central Bank agreed to a €1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a €750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of ‘the pandemic’ on businesses and workers. What happened in Europe was part of a strategy to avert the wider systemic collapse of the financial system. And what we have seen since COVID is a massive increase in global debt, inflation and more ‘austerity’ imposed on ordinary people. Since 2020, in the UK, poverty has increased in two-thirds of communities, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions of people and living standards are plummeting. The poorest families have been enduring a ‘frightening’ collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. Lockdowns were not imposed for public health reasons; they were implemented to prevent hyperinflation and manage a crisis of capitalism. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University argues that by suspending economic activity via lockdowns, governments aimed to mitigate inflationary pressures resulting from excessive liquidity injected into the economy through QE. The lockdowns also facilitated a restructuring of the economy, allowing larger corporations to absorb smaller businesses struggling to survive during this period. Prior to 2020, government reliance on financial markets and monetary policy tools like QE did not address underlying social and economic issues but instead perpetuated the system and existing inequalities. Policies rolled out as part of the COVID event reflected a continuation of neoliberal principles, with governments opting for temporary fixes rather than comprehensive reforms that prioritise public welfare. The extraordinary monetary policies (lockdowns) served to maintain financial stability at the expense of broader societal needs. In the run up to COVID, QE created an illusion of stability within financial markets, allowing governments to avoid confronting deeper structural issues. This policy led to asset bubbles and increased volatility, creating a precarious situation where any attempt to tighten monetary policy could trigger significant market disruptions. So, has anyone challenged this analysis of locating COVID policies within a framework that emphasises underlying economic determinants? In mainstream discourse, it has been ignored. That’s not too surprising because it would put the final nail in the coffin of the dominant COVID narrative. While the Ukraine war and supply chain disruptions are often cited as primary inflation drivers once COVID-related restrictions were lifted, some economists predicted that once lockdowns had ended, inflation could surge dramatically. As Deutsche Bank noted, after 30 years of low inflation, this “benign era could end abruptly once lockdowns are lifted”. Deutsche Bank also stated that the biggest financial bailout in history took place during the COVID era. Meanwhile, most economists would probably dismiss out of hand the arguments stated above rather than engage with them critically. Challenging the prevailing economic orthodoxy never goes down well. Highlighting systemic failures associated with neoliberal frameworks and questioning the efficacy of measures like QE in addressing underlying issues requires open dialogue rather than heavy handed pushback. During COVID, the UK government implemented several financial measures to support workers and businesses, with a significant focus on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), commonly known as the furlough scheme. The CJRS cost the UK government approximately £70 billion. This scheme enabled employers to claim grants covering up to 80% of employees’ wages, with a cap of £2,500 per month per employee. To finance this unprecedented level of support, the UK government increased its borrowing significantly. This borrowing was necessary to cover not only the furlough scheme but also other COVID policy measures. The increase in borrowing led to a substantial rise in public debt, which was exacerbated by the economic downturn caused by lockdowns and restrictions. Much of this debt was financed through mechanisms such as QE by the Bank of England, which involved purchasing government bonds. In the fiscal year 2019/20, prior to the COVID event, the UK government borrowed approximately £62.3 billion. This figure represented about 2.8% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at that time. In stark contrast, during the fiscal year 2020/21, government borrowing surged to around £303 billion. This significant increase in borrowing reflects the unprecedented financial measures taken by the UK government. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, recently highlighted a £22 billion “gap” in public finances attributed to the previous administration. Keir Starmer is warning of unprecedented economic challenges — promises of ongoing economic woe (for ordinary people) that echo what economist Huw Pill said a couple of years ago — that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. Of course, COVID lockdowns and restrictions were all about ‘saving granny’. And if you challenged the narrative or did not comply, you were beyond the moral pale. Those who recognise the manipulation of public sentiment by those who control the global economy might be forgiven for viewing the ‘saving granny’ narrative as the height of cynicism, coming from individuals who have demonstrated a lack of moral standards for decades with their wars, destructive economic policies and complete disregard for ordinary working people. And although people like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates were often singled out for criticism by those who challenged the mainstream narrative on COVID, when referring to the ‘controllers of the global economy’, this means those who largely remain in the shadows, the powerful and unscrupulous banking families and their handmaidens discussed by Dean Henderson in a detailed five-part series of articles back in 2011. Meanwhile, in the UK, there continues to be money available (to date almost £13 billion) to send to Ukraine to ensure the killing and dying continues in order to guarantee that those bastions of morality — BlackRock, J P Morgan and all — get their slice of the post-war honey pot.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 3% this morning after plunging nearly 17% yesterday. The rebound came after JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on NVDA today. Why JPMorgan Remains Bullish on NVDA Noting that Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that it had trained an AI model for a very low price of about $5.6 million, JPMorgan asserted that this news is actually positive for chip makers. Specifically, according to the bank, when computing products become less costly to manufacture historically, the demand for chips and the consumption of more expensive chips have increased. The latter trend should play out going forward in the AI chip market, JPMorgan asserted. Further, the bank wrote that some information about DeepSeek's model has not been provided. For example, the total cost of all training sessions may not have been included in the $5.6 million total, and the degree to which the start-up used existing open-source models was not disclosed, JPMorgan stated. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” the bank wrote. The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock In the last month heading into today, the shares had dropped 12%, while they had pulled back 16% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
