Title: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History’s Turning

Bitcoin is drifting just above $105,000 on June 5, its lowest realized volatility in almost two years, yet Swan, the Los-Angeles-based “Bitcoin-only” financial services firm, contends the market is on the verge of its most radical re-pricing ever. In a X thread on Wednesday night, the company argued that the familiar four-year boom-and-bust cadence is giving way to “the last rotation”—a silent transfer of coins from retail speculators to institutions whose investment horizons stretch decades. “People less committed to the long term are exiting […] and a whole new class of investors is entering,” Swan is quoting Michael Saylor, framing the hand-off from retail traders to corporate treasuries, ETFs and multinationals such as BlackRock and Fidelity. So far, 2025 has defied the script. The third calendar year of every prior cycle—2013, 2017 and 2021—delivered the vertical moves that defined those eras. This year has offered “big moves, but also shallower corrections and longer periods of sideways chop,” Swan writes, conceding that the price action “is boring people.” The firm’s thesis is that boredom masks an invisible supply squeeze: long-time holders taking profits above $100,000 while “long-only buyers,” in Swan’s words, methodically absorb the float. “These corporations, they’re long-only buyers. Not traders of Bitcoin,” Swan argues, underscoring the firm’s view that coins migrating into corporate vaults are effectively removed from circulation. The thread portrays three intertwined rotations: Between entities – Trustees, lawyers and early adopters are exiting; ETFs, corporations and “sovereign-grade balance sheets” are stepping in. Between intentions – Speculation gives way to allocation. “This new wave of buyers isn’t speculating,” Swan writes. “They’re allocating.” Between generations. The Silent Generation hoarded gold; Boomers compounded in equities; Gen X surfed tech; now Millennials, “entering their peak accumulation years,” are “inheriting trillions—and they’re choosing Bitcoin.” Supply dynamics, Swan contends, make those rotations irreversible. “When long-term capital meets inelastic supply, the float starts vanishing,” the firm warns. “That’s when things get explosive.” The macro backdrop adds pressure: Swan points to a “rare and dangerous split” in which the US dollar is weakening even as bond yields surge—an environment, it says, that could funnel excess capital toward a neutral store of value. “This isn’t just the next cycle. It’s the end of an era,” Swan concludes. “If you’re selling now, understand you’re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution that plans to hold it indefinitely. Once it’s gone, you’re probably never getting it back.” For Swan, the implication is stark. The apparent tranquility near $105,000 is less a sign of exhaustion than the quiet before a permanent liquidity event—one in which the marginal seller disappears, the marginal buyer never sells, and price must eventually mark higher to find equilibrium. “Think twice,” Swan advises would-be profit-takers. “The float is drying up. The buyers are built different. This is the last Bitcoin rotation.” If the firm is right, history is not repeating so much as culminating, and the market’s current stillness may soon be remembered as the eye of a generational storm.

Title: Circle raises $1.1 billion in upsized IPO, prices shares at $31
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-raises-1-1-billion-in-upsized-ipo-prices-shares-at-31/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T02:42:53Z
Full Content:
Circle Internet Group Inc., a prominent player in the stablecoin arena, successfully navigated its initial public offering (IPO), raising nearly $1.1 billion in an upsized deal that saw shares priced above the initially marketed range. This strong market reception is being interpreted as a significant indicator of the increasing acceptance and perceived legitimacy of stablecoin issuers within the broader financial landscape. The stablecoin firm, along with some of its existing shareholders including co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire, sold a total of 34 million shares on Wednesday at a price of $31 each, according to a statement confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. This pricing gives Circle a market valuation of approximately $6.9 billion based on the outstanding shares detailed in its regulatory filings. When accounting for employee stock options, restricted share units, and warrants, the company’s fully diluted valuation reaches about $8.1 billion. The offering’s success was underscored by significant investor interest. The upsized deal reportedly fielded demand for more than 25 times the number of shares available by the time orders closed on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. This overwhelming demand prompted Circle to increase the size and price of its IPO earlier in the week. On Monday, the target for the offering was raised to 32 million shares at a price range of $27 to $28 per share, a notable increase from the initial plan to sell 24 million shares within a $24 to $26 price range, as indicated in its earlier filings. In the final tally, Circle itself sold 14.8 million shares in the IPO, while the selling shareholders divested the remaining 19.2 million shares. Circle’s successful public offering comes at a pivotal time for stablecoins – digital tokens typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Legislation currently before the US Congress aims to regulate these assets, a development that many believe will confer greater legitimacy upon them and potentially pave the way for broader adoption. However, this evolving regulatory landscape may also attract new and formidable competitors. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that some of Wall Street’s largest banks are jointly exploring the possibility of issuing their own stablecoins. Circle’s flagship product, USDC, held approximately 29% of the stablecoin market as of the end of March, according to data from CoinMarketCap cited in the company’s filing. As of May 29, there was about $61 billion worth of USDC in circulation, according to information on Circle’s website. The IPO has attracted notable institutional investors. ARK Investment Management, the technology-focused investment firm founded by Cathie Wood, expressed interest in purchasing as much as $150 million worth of shares in Circle’s IPO, according to the filing. Furthermore, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly plans to acquire about 10% of the IPO shares, people familiar with the matter have said. This interest is particularly significant given BlackRock’s existing relationship with Circle; BlackRock manages a government money market fund on Circle’s behalf, which holds 90% of the reserves backing its USDC stablecoin. The Circle Reserve Fund reportedly had a balance of $53.3 billion as of May 29. This IPO marks a significant milestone in Circle’s journey. The company was valued at $7.7 billion after a funding round in 2022, according to data provider PitchBook. Circle had initially filed confidentially for a listing in early 2024, more than a year after it had abandoned a previous attempt to go public through a merger with a blank-check company (SPAC). That earlier SPAC deal would have valued the company at $9 billion. The current IPO is being led by a consortium of Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Circle’s shares are expected to begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CRCL.

Circle's IPO was oversubscribed by more than 25x on the back of robust demand from institutional investors and major financial firms. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Circle is poised to price its initial public offering above its marketed range after receiving investor orders for more than 25x the number of shares available, Bloomberg reported on June 4, citing people familiar with the matter. The stablecoin issuer and its backers are offering 32 million shares at a price range of $27 to $28, aiming to raise up to $896 million. At the high end of that range, Circle’s implied market capitalization would be approximately $6.2 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.2 billion, according to regulatory filings. The IPO, expected to price on the evening of June 4 in New York, reflects strong demand from institutional investors. The offering was originally sized at 24 million shares with a range of $24 to $26. Final allocations are expected to favor long-term holders. Circle is the issuer behind USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in circulation, which held roughly 29% of the stablecoin market as of March. The IPO arrives as US lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation that could bring regulatory clarity and mainstream legitimacy to digital dollar-pegged tokens. The stablecoin issuer’s offering has drawn interest from major financial firms. Ark Invest is looking to buy up to $150 million worth of shares in the IPO, while BlackRock is expected to acquire about 10% of the total offered shares. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs are leading the underwriting for the offering. Circle is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” The IPO comes as traditional financial institutions explore stablecoin initiatives of their own, with several Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan, reportedly examining joint issuance efforts.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. US President Donald Trump’s circle moved closer to rolling out two big crypto products this week. One announcement sparked a public mix‐up over who’s doing what. The other took a formal step toward a Bitcoin exchange‐traded fund. Both moves show the family’s push for more crypto ties. According to reports, @GetTrumpMemes on X said on Tuesday that a new crypto wallet branded with US President Trump’s picture is coming. The post said Magic Eden will power the wallet and that users could grab up to $1 million in TRUMP token rewards by joining a waitlist. Some readers rushed to sign up. But then Donald Trump Jr., who serves as Web3 Ambassador to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), posted that his family isn’t involved in that exact product. He called out the official TRUMP token account and said WLFI will launch its own branded wallet at a later date. With Billions of Trump fans around the world, the $TRUMP mission has always been to make it super easy for Trump supporters to get into crypto and join the $TRUMP community. The $TRUMP Wallet powered by @magiceden is coming soon. Join the $TRUMP community!… pic.twitter.com/7nIubWIdqw — TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) June 3, 2025 Eric Trump chimed in too, saying he and his brother have no link to the version teased by the TRUMP token team. That disagreement left fans scratching their heads. Who really owns this wallet? It’s clear that the brand name draws attention, but so does the split between the token’s official page and the Trump family’s own statements. Based on filings, NYSE Arca took the first legal step on Tuesday to list a Truth Social Bitcoin spot ETF. The 19b-4 request went to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Yorkville American Digital, a Florida asset manager, is the sponsor. If approved, this would become the 13th US Bitcoin spot ETF and join big names like BlackRock and Fidelity. The move follows an April partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to launch “Made In America” exchange‐traded products that include Bitcoin and Crypto.com’s Cronos token. Back then, people in crypto circles saw a sign that Trump Media aims to bundle patriotism with digital coins. Now the new filing shows they’re serious about offering a mainstream Bitcoin fund. People watching this space know that WLFI dipped into stablecoins before. And Trump Media said it plans a Bitcoin Treasury worth $2.5 billion at launch. So the family name is already tied to crypto money. Yet the wallet announcement on X and the family’s denials highlight how fast things can sound official—especially when magic Eden and a popular meme token are involved. One side says, “We’re doing it,” while the other side says, “Not us.” When branding blurs the lines between projects, users may wonder which link to trust. That split can hurt credibility, even if the goal is to ride high on an eye‐catching name. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US-based ETFs offering staking set for growth despite some regulatory, macro tailwinds

Recent regulatory developments and potential US-China trade talks outcomes could boost are expected to benefit staking ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that integrate staking yields stand to benefit significantly as US lawmakers and regulators clarify the legal status of on-chain rewards, according to a June 3 report. The report noted points to two parallel policy moves. First, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed on May 29 that staking does not constitute a securities sale, provided customers keep ownership of their assets and receive risk disclosures. This understanding applies to solo, delegated, or carried out through a custodial service staking. Second, the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) would shift the oversight of most secondary market token trading to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) while leaving initial fundraising events under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The CLARITY Act is also a recent move in the US crypto industry, filed on the same day as the SEC shared its statement on staking. However, no ETF offering staking has received regulatory approval as of June 4. Nansen argues that the twin actions remove a structural barrier for issuers planning products that wrap staking rewards inside an ETF chassis. The note named BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise as manufacturers preparing to capitalize on the change alongside significant staking assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and BNB, as well as liquid staking protocols like LIDO. The report also mapped two macro paths tied to US-China trade talks that could add fuel to boost ETFs offering to stake. Under the base case scenario, which assumes talks “muddle through” and the Senate softens a pending tax provision, Bitcoin (BTC) retests its record. At the same time, staked currencies receive an extra boost from regulatory momentum. In the bearish scenario, a tariff re-escalation pressures equities first. Yet, the report still shared expectations that staked tokens and related ETFs would outpace stocks because their yield component would offset price weakness. Data from DefiLlama reveals that ETH staking and liquid staking yields range between 2.5% and 3% on the largest platforms by total value locked (TVL). The average for SOL using the same data ranges from 6.5% to 8%, while Staking Rewards data highlight a 2.1% average yield for BNB. Beyond the scenario matrix, the research cited a drop in the equity risk premium below 2.5% and subdued equity volatility as evidence that traditional markets may undercompensate investors for risk. By contrast, staking-enabled ETFs combine crypto upside with a yield stream that does not rely on corporate earnings. Nansen concluded that regulatory clarity, macro diversification, and investor appetite for blockchain yield create an opening for funds that pass staking rewards through to shareholders.

Title: Global Trade at Gunpoint
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/trump-creates-liberation-day-expanding-corporate-power-global-trade
Time Published: 2025-06-04T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump stood behind a podium in a large clearing of the Rose Garden, American flags hanging vertically between each White House column, to lambast a global trade system in which ​“our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.” It was April 2, which Trump deemed ​“Liberation Day,” and he was declaring ​“economic independence” from the rest of the world. The message was that of an underdog finally standing up against abuse. Workers have ​“watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” the president said. ​“We had an American dream that you don’t hear so much about.” The headlines were dramatic. ​“Trump’s tariffs mark the end of an era for free trade in North America,” the Washington Post proclaimed. But what were the president’s actual grievances? About five minutes into the announcement, Trump started waving what he called a ​“special book” back and forth, like a prosecutor holding up evidence in a courtroom. The misdeeds against the United States, he said, are ​“detailed in a very big report by the U.S. Trade Representative.” The document, the 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, is a 377-page laundry list of what the United States views as ​“trade barriers” but what people in other countries might see as legitimate protections and regulations. These barriers, for example, include a bird-flufood safety measure in Morocco and a requirement in Nigeria that certain imports are certified ​“safe for human use and consumption.” They also include Canada’s ​“comprehensive agenda to achieve zero plastic waste by 2030” and Colombia’s requirements that imports of U.S. milk powder meet lactic acid and other quality standards. The barriers Trump cited in his Liberation Day address are, in many cases, measures that protect working-class people in the United States and around the world. There is little clarity about the trade deals Trump claims to be pursuing; his administration says he wants to negotiate 90 deals in 90 days. But there is every reason to be concerned he is using tariffs as leverage to advance some of the most coercive aspects of U.S. power: to undermine national sovereignty of other countries, trample on public goods and expand the brute power of the United States and its multinational corporations. Put another way: Behind all the lunch pail rhetoric, antiestablishment posturing and feigned concern for the working class, what Trump is proposing is more heavy-handed, anti-worker, military-driven economic policies. But the situation is not just ​“free trade” as usual. It is an agenda to expand corporate power, in the hands of a president who takes coercion to new heights. In the same executive order that established ​“reciprocal tariffs” on April 2, Trump was explicit about setting up a protection racket. The order states that the United States may decide to reduce tariffs if a country changes its policies to ​“align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.” For Trump’s Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), it’s a problem that South Korea prioritizes domestic technology for its own weapons production. South Korea is a close U.S. ally and hosts 80 U.S. military base sites and nearly 29,000 American troops. Yet, for this administration, South Korea must also keep its doors perpetually open to purchases from the American weapons industry, which is already the largest in the world. Among the unfair trade barriers that must be torn down, the USTR report says, are ​“policies that prioritize local technology and products over foreign defense technology.” Cathi Choi, executive director of Women Cross DMZ, which organizes for peace in Korea, explains that the idea aligns ​“with all of the vested financial interests in maintaining the forever war in Korea. Weapons manufacturers profit from this war, and it’s everyday people who are losing out.” The Korean War, to which the United States is officially a party, never formally ended, which has led to a dangerous demilitarized zone littered with landmines, as well as perpetual, forced family separations. The report’s mention of these ​“defense” barriers is no small thing, as the document provides guidance for trade policy under Trump. ​“This report lays out both the type of policies and the exact policies that the United States is trying to dismantle around the globe,” says Arthur Stamoulis, executive director of the Citizens Trade Campaign, a coalition of environmental, labor and other civil society groups. It’s ​“one of the best indicators we have right now of the Trump administration’s trade priorities.” The annual report typically skews pro-corporate. It’s been published every year since 1985, and the reports have purveyed ​“free trade” dogma under both Democratic and Republican administrations. But Trump’s national trade estimate is more extreme than in recent years, especially when it comes to opposing big tech regulations, like privacy protections, and pushing back against most anything that would limit profits for the weapons industry. The report reads like a corporate wish list, identifying environmental protections and public health and safety measures as barriers to trade. And Trump is using tariffs as a bludgeon, to force other countries to agree to these demands. “It’s really the coercion of the tariff threat that’s new,” says Léa Auffret, a Brussels-based leader with the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a network of 76 consumer and digital rights groups. The 2025 report marks an escalation from previous years when it comes to the U.S. weapons industry, and the barriers to U.S. weapons companies in South Korea it mentioned were never brought up under Biden. The report also charges that measures around the world that limit the purchasing of American arms are barriers to trade, from Brazil’s prioritization of domestic defense manufacturing to Colombia’s requirement of ​“government-to government agreements for some defense procurements.” In all, there are 62 mentions of ​“defense” in the 2025 report, up from 29 in 2024 and 33 in 2023. It also mentions more jurisdictions (countries and regions) — 17 in 2025, versus 11 in 2024 and 15 in 2023. But the USTR is not just protecting American weapons companies. The new report also targets environmental policies, including Thailand’s renewable energy incentive, which ​“aims to increase biofuel and renewable energy consumption to 30% by 2037.” Climate change poses an immediate existential threat to Thailand: Bangkok is sinking into the sea as ocean levels rise, and the capital could be 40% flooded by 2030, according to the World Bank. The report also names a European Union plan to reduce deforestation as a trade barrier, as well as an EU regulation to protect public health and the environment from toxic chemicals, including carcinogens. Labor unions supported the regulation, known by its acronym REACH, when it was first implemented in 2007; workers had a stake in ensuring they were not exposed to hazardous chemicals on the job. It’s not the first time the EU’s chemical regulations have been in the crosshairs of the United States. When the Obama administration tried, in 2013, to negotiate the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a massive trade deal, the administration also took issue with the EU’s chemical regulations, along with a host of other protections, from ​“reimbursement of medicines to how we treat food safety,” Auffret recalls. In light of Trump’s national trade estimate report, she is bracing for more. “When your laws are listed, you’re under pressure,” Auffret says. ​“It’s a signal from the U.S., ​‘We’re watching this issue and we’re going to bring it up and up and up all over again.’ ” Esther Lynch, general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, says ​“there can be no doubt” that the Trump administration is going to use trade deals to undermine protections around the world. “We are calling on the [European] Commission not to give in to this type of bullying,” Lynch says. The report lists public health and safety measures, too, as barriers to trade, including higher standards and regulations on vehicle safety in Japan, Taiwan and Egypt. Egypt has one of the highest rates of deadly road traffic accidents in the world, killing around 12,000 people a year. The so-called barriers continue into, for example, price caps on coronary stents and knee implants in India. The report also identifies the Indian Patents Act that imposes limits on frivolous patents, which thereby helps ward off pharmaceutical monopolies, as a barrier. This law helps keep the cost of medicines down in a country where 7% of the population—or 100 million people — are thrown into poverty every year because of healthcare spending.K.M. Gopakumar is a New Delhi-based legal advisor and senior researcher with the Third World Network, which promotes just and sustainable development in the Global South. He says this language is concerning, because ​“price control offers an important tool to protect people from the exploitation of commercial actors.” When it comes to the regulation of big tech, Trump’s report has more corporate giveaways to ​“commercial actors” than the Biden administration. Trump’s USTR identifies ​“digital trade barriers” in 35 countries plus the European Union, and takes aim at the regulation of artificial intelligence, privacy protections and digital services taxes, which allow countries to tax big tech companies that aren’t physically located within their borders. ​“In essence, President Trump has declared a trade war on countries who have the temerity to regulate Big Tech in the interests of their people,” Public Citizen, a watchdog organization, asserted in a statement. The 2024 report recognized that countries have ​“a sovereign right to adopt measures in furtherance of legitimate public purposes,” wording that had given some social justice organizations hope that the USTR, under Katherine Tai, would take a different tack. Melinda St. Louis, the director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, says, ​“Last year’s report under President Biden had a more nuanced approach, removing a number of public interest laws from the list. But now they’re back in.” Canada’s policy to decrease plastic waste, for example, was included in 2022 but then omitted in 2023 and 2024. Now it’s back. The very concept of a ​“non-tariff barrier” to trade has been used since the Nixon administration as a euphemism for steamrolling basic public goods and regulations to make way for corporate profits, David Dayen points out in The American Prospect. Stamoulis, of the Citizens Trade Campaign, is concerned that the concept is now at the center of Trump’s trade policy. ​“This is the most powerful country on Earth dictating what governments are and aren’t allowed to do to protect the health and well-being of their populations on a day-to-day basis,” he says. ​“This impacts food safety, access to medicine, online safety. Real stuff with real life-and death consequences.” On Liberation Day, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, as well as dramatically steeper ​“reciprocal tariff ” rates for dozens of countries from South Korea to Taiwan to China. The steeper rates were soon suspended for 90 days, except on China, to allow Trump to negotiate trade deals — an open strategy to use tariffs as a stick to extract concessions. (Though on May 12, the United States reached an agreement to temporarily reduce its tariffs on China to 30%, while China cuts its import duty to 10% on U.S. goods.) We already know that Trump has a propensity toward using tariffs to reward friends. He did so during his first term, when he imposed tariffs on some imports from China in 2018, yet granted exemptions to donors and associates. A 2024 study in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis found that companies had a 1 in 5 chance of getting an exclusion from the tariffs if they had donated to Republican candidates, versus a 1 in 10 chance if they had given to Democrats. There is reason to think that this trend is continuing into the present. ProPublica found that firms with political connections, or those that heavily lobby the Trump administration, ​“might be winning carve-outs” from sanctions. And the Washington Post found that, amid tariff trade talks, U.S. embassies and the State Department are pressing countries to license with Starlink, the satellite internet company owned by Elon Musk, Trump’s powerful associate and largest donor. The Liberation Day tariffs are far more sweeping than any in Trump’s first term, and any concessions will be extracted at gunpoint. The guns are not just metaphorical. There are signs that Trump will try to use tariffs, or trade more broadly, to fortify the U.S. military, which is by far the most heavily funded on the planet, with an estimated 750 military bases around the globe. Bloomberg reported April 21 that Trump has ​“raised the financial contribution Tokyo makes to support U.S. military bases in Japan as an issue of concern, including before a meeting with Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa last week.” (There are at least 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan, where U.S. military bases have faced local protests for decades over environmental pollution, sexual assaults and other issues.) “China is clearly the number-one target of these tariff policies,” says Lindsay Koshgarian, program director for the National Priorities Project, which produces research about military spending. ​“Diplomatic relationships between the U.S. and China have fallen apart. This is a key ingredient setting us up for actual military conflict.” In response to the ​“reciprocal tariffs,” China is stepping up its own efforts to cultivate trade and investment deals with other countries, a move that could ultimately weaken the U.S. empire. But even this tit for tat has consequences. ​“This is the classic Cold War arrangement of lack of diplomacy and aligning countries against each other,” says Koshgarian. ​“There’s the possibility not just of direct war, but proxy wars and military buildup.” Trump has used tariffs to bolster other violent aspects of the U.S. security state. Even before declaring Liberation Day, he used the threat of tariffs to press countries into participating in his imprisonment and deportation of immigrants, or escalating their own border militarization. In January, for example, Trump successfully used the threat of tariffs to pressure Colombia into accepting flights of deported migrants. (Colombia had initially resisted to protest the administration’s poor treatment of migrants.) In February, Trump threatened tariffs unless Mexico deployed its military to parts of the border with allegedly high rates of border crossing. Trump already has one major domestic policy proposal we can review to understand his trade priorities. His proposal of a $1 trillion military budget is the most bloated domestic industrial policy we have in this country (and is actually higher when militarized spending in other budgets is included). Every year, around half of the military budget goes to military contractors like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, which are manufacturing the bombs being dropped on Yemen and Gaza or loaded onto the warships encircling China. In turn, Trump’s USTR does the bidding of the U.S. weapons industry, giving countries black marks for measures limiting U.S. weapons industry profits. “I think what we’re witnessing is an embrace of all the tools of U.S. imperialism,” says David Vine, a political anthropologist and author of Base Nation: How U.S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World. According to Vine, we are seeing this imperial bent with Trump’s territorial claims, ​“threatening to invade and seize Greenland,Gaza, Canada, Panama. “He is embracing forms of economic imperialism that certainly have been part of past administrations, but he’s embracing them in profoundly broader ways and deeper ways.” No doubt, capital was not happy with Trump’s announced reciprocal tariffs. The stock market tanked near bear market territory, and millionaires and billionaires took the rare step of speaking out against Trump’s policies. But just because the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock vocally denounced them doesn’t mean they’re somehow a bulwark against the excesses of capital; the pushback likely came against uncertainty, day-to day volatility and caprice, rather than against the ultimate goal of maximizing American corporate power. “Trump is trying to use the failures of the system to win workers’ votes,” says Manuel Pérez-Rocha, an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, who has spent nearly three decades researching trade. ​“But workers are being defrauded.” There is a debate to be had about the role sectoral tariffs could play in a larger industrial policy to protect wages and working conditions. United Auto Workers, for example, has argued in favor of certain tariffs and even praised Trump’s auto tariffs in late March, parting with the Canadian auto union Unifor. Labor journalist Luis Feliz Leon has suggested there are more internationalist frameworks for labor to take up, like cross-border coordination focused on protecting workers throughout corporate supply chains. But perhaps Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are not, functionally, tariffs at all. As David Dayen argued in The American Prospect on April 3, they’re best understood as sanctions, ​“only he’s doing it against the whole world, all at once, for the assumed harm of ​‘ripping off ’ the United States for decades.” As Dayen wrote: ​“It is no different from a mob boss moving into town and sending his thugs to every business on Main Street, roughing up the proprietors and asking for protection money so they don’t get pushed out of business.” One major thing Trump’s tariffs have in common with sanctions: On Liberation Day, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 as the authority for his reciprocal tariffs. For decades, the act has been used by presidents to impose sweeping— and devastating — economic sanctions on countries from Venezuela to Cuba to Iran to Vietnam. Before Trump took office, it had been used by presidents 69 times, according to the Congressional Research Service, and it ​“sits at the center of the modern U.S. sanctions regime.” But there are also key differences. Sanctions are framed as punitive against ​“enemy” countries, whereas reciprocal tariffs are ostensibly aimed at trade relations with the entire world. And they are being used against U.S. allies, raising questions about whether Trump is pursuing empire in traditional terms, by expanding spheres of American influence. Whether or not reciprocal tariffs constitute formal sanctions, Trump is using them (or the threat of them) as a cudgel against other countries in what appears to be a bid to project American strength. They should be viewed as part of a longer history of the United States using economic pressure to achieve might. Even should Trump ultimately be bluffing, his bluffing has tremendous economic and policy implications, as we are seeing with the global frenzy to respond to tariff threats. This is true even as U.S. courts question the fundamental legitimacy of the ​“Liberation Day” tariffs, with the chance that they could be overthrown for good, though the Trump administration is digging in its heels. Does this moment mark a break from neoliberalism, or an intensification of it? Are we closer to a 19th- or 20thcentury colonialism, or a more modern form of economic nationalism coupled with imperialism? Trump himself has been erratic: He has presented himself as a defender of American workers despite waging an unprecedented war on the basic rights of workers to collectively bargain, meanwhile gutting public programs for the poor at a headspinning pace. He bemoans the free trade system while embracing its most destructive components, such as opposition to public health, environmental protections and welfare programs, and his own renegotiation of NAFTA during his first term ended up being a huge disappointment for workers. And there are reasons to think there are divisions within the Trump administration, as Elon Musk parts with Trump on tariffs while some advisors, like Peter Navarro, double down. Ultimately, it’s not rhetoric or buzzwords that are important, but the material policies the most powerful person on Earth is advancing. And while it is difficult to know what is going on in the president’s psyche, there is a consistent throughline that runs throughout his actions: marrying trade and militarism as a means to undermine other countries’ sovereignty and democratic decision-making, and projecting an image of American strength that is rooted in violent domination and the erosion of the welfare state. On Liberation Day, Trump stood on the Rose Garden lawn and called out ​“American steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen, we have a lot of them here with us today. They really suffered gravely.” And they have, in the United States and around the world, due to decades of pro-corporate measures that have battered workers and left them without basic protections. It’s a trend Trump is by no means reversing, but escalating — complete with new, faux-populist branding — at a breakneck pace.

Title: JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin ETFs as loan collateral, consider digital holdings in evaluations

JP Morgan integrates Bitcoin ETFs and digital asset holdings into lending criteria amid growing institutional confidence. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan is set to begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds as collateral for loans, Bloomberg News reported on June 4. The lender also plans to consider digital asset holdings when evaluating a client’s net worth and liquid assets, placing crypto alongside traditional categories such as equities, vehicles, and fine art when assessing lending eligibility. The move signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets and an evolving approach to wealth management under a more permissive regulatory landscape in the US. The program will initially include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and will be made available to both trading and wealth-management clients in the coming weeks, the report said, citing individuals familiar with the matter. The shift positions the largest US bank to compete more aggressively as crypto investment products gain traction among retail and high-net-worth clients alike. The policy will be implemented globally across JPMorgan’s private client tiers, offering structured credit backed by crypto ETF holdings. While the bank had previously reviewed such collateral on a case-by-case basis, the new framework formalizes the practice and paves the way for the inclusion of additional spot Bitcoin ETFs over time. Bitcoin ETFs have seen rapid growth since their debut in January 2024, with US-listed products now overseeing more than $128 billion in assets. Their popularity has surged in tandem with a broader political and institutional embrace of the sector following the election of President Donald Trump. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has consistently expressed personal skepticism about Bitcoin but reaffirmed the firm’s commitment to providing access for clients seeking exposure. He recently said the lender would “support” Bitcoin since clients want it even if he doesn’t like it personally during the bank’s May investor presentation. JP Morgan is also involved in a joint venture with other major Wall Street lenders looking to launch a stablecoin. The decision comes amid a marked shift in Washington’s approach to digital assets. Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has backed a series of pro-crypto policies, dismantling several barriers that previously deterred large banks from engaging fully with the sector. His administration’s stance, bolstered by industry donations and growing political support, has fueled renewed optimism across US markets and digital assets. Trump-affiliated firms have also expanded their presence in the crypto ecosystem, from Bitcoin treasury purchases and a spot ETF to speculative ventures involving meme tokens and infrastructure play With traditional finance and digital assets increasingly intertwined, JPMorgan’s collateralization policy marks a significant step in the institutionalization of crypto. As demand for yield, liquidity, and alternative exposure continues to rise, banks are racing to offer products that bridge old and new markets.

Title: Circle IPO Pricing Could Jump Above Range as Investor Orders Surge: Bloomberg

Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group may price its upcoming initial public offering (IPO) well above its marketed range after demand from investors far outpaced supply, according to Bloomberg. The company has reportedly received orders for more than 25 times the number of shares available in the offering. Circle is expected to finalize its pricing following U.S. market hours on Wednesday. Circle’s most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed plans to sell 32 million shares at a range between $27 and $28 apiece. At the high end of that range, the IPO would value the company at roughly $7.2 billion on a fully diluted basis. Investors placing orders could include major institutions such as BlackRock and Ark Invest. Allocations will favor buyers who plan to hold the stock over the long term, according to the report. The outsized interest signals strong demand for exposure to crypto-related firms, even as the industry navigates an evolving regulatory landscape. Circle, best known for issuing the USDC stablecoin, plays a critical role in the blockchain-based payments and finance infrastructure.

Title: ‘I think the build up is so much worse’: Leaving Cert students relieved after first exam completed

Emotions were high this morning in Belmayne Educate Together Secondary School (ETSS) in north Dublin, where the school’s first cohort of sixth year students began their Leaving Certificate exams with English Paper 1. For Zuzanna Zoltowska (18), anticipating the exams has been nerve-racking. “It’s honestly just a stressful experience ... Going into that exam I was like ‘Oh my God, I’m going to die.’” Zoltowska wants to study physics in Dublin City University (DCU), a subject that she is feeling more confident about tackling. “I think I have one of those more technical minds. English isn’t my strongest subject, I’ll say that.” [ Carl O’Brien: ‘Day one done’ - Leaving Cert tips for students and their supportersOpens in new window ] Her six years at Belmayne ETSS, which was established in 2019, have “gone by really fast”. “Until the last second you’re like, it’s not going to happen, and then suddenly you’re in the room and you’re doing your Leaving Cert.” The “mixture of anxiety and tiredness” school principal Aisling Kenevey saw among Zoltowska and her classmates before they turned over their first exam papers on Wednesday morning had been replaced by relief and animated reflection by 11.50am. Students gathered around their English teacher, Sinéad McGowan, to dissect the paper. Ms McGowan said students in her class had the chance to show off their creative flair with the opportunity to write a short story about their family pet, a task several gravitated towards. “I have a lot of lads that are really funny so I think they really leaned into that and their sense of humour will shine out, hopefully.” The theme of the underdog resonated with students who took the Higher Level English paper this morning. “This year we feel like the underdogs,” said Ms McGowan, “I think they connected emotionally with that one because they do feel hard done by in that the inflated grades ended just in time for them.” A “postmarking adjustment” applied to students’ grades this year will reduce from 7 per cent to 5.5 per cent, meaning students’ grades will be lower, on aggregate, compared with the bumper grades achieved over recent years. English is Sarah Osbourne’s (18) favourite subject, and one she wants to continue in college. She has Arts in Maynooth and a creative writing course in Blackrock College on her Central Applications Office (CAO) form. There was a period where I wanted to drop out,” said Osbourne, who is now glad she decided to complete her Leaving Certificate. “Those last two years make or break you. They push you and then once you’re finished it’s just such a relief. I think that the build up is so much worse.” Páidí Malone (19) is hoping to study politics and history in DCU while Arron Kavanagh (18) plans “to start working and save up a bit of money, probably go travelling”. Cormac Taaffe (18) has “an electrician apprenticeship lined up” for next year, while Ilyas Ugurlu (18) is looking forward to studying engineering technology.

Title: Roads policing numbers at historic low of 618 gardaí, figures show
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/06/04/garda-road-policing-numbers-drop-safety/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T17:03:39Z
Full Content:
The number of gardaí involved in roads policing units has dropped to a historic low of 618, according to the latest Department of Justice figures. There has been a steady decline since 2009 when official figures for those engaged in roads policing began to be regularly published. That year 1,046 gardaí were assigned to road policing duties and the numbers involved fell to a low of 623 in 2017. They rose over the next four years to 736 in 2021 but have fallen again, down to 627 last year. In January this year the number of gardaí in the units dropped to 626, to 623 in February and was down to 618 by the end of April. Every region and county has seen the number of roads policing gardaí drop, in some cases by more than 50 per cent since 2009. Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the Oireachtas Transport Committee in May last year “we plan to add 75 gardaí to roads policing this year and a further 75 in 2025, and working towards this, we are proactively recruiting into our roads policing units”. A recruitment campaign was undertaken in eastern, north-western and southern regions last year. But Susan Gray of road safety campaign group Parc said the figures show a reduction of nine members at the end of April compared to last year. “They are just playing catch up all the time.” The figures show the Sligo/Leitrim Garda Division had 23 members in 2021, but it was down to 11 in February this year. Donegal had 31 Garda roads policing members in 2021, which fell to 21 last year, a reduction of 10 officers in three years. Official Road Safety Authority data shows 17 road deaths in Donegal last year, “the highest number since 2010 when 19 died”, Ms Gray said. Sixty-nine people have died on Irish roads so far this year, she said. In the Dublin Metropolitan Area the numbers have dropped from their 2009 high but have remained consistent over the last two to three years. In Dublin’s eastern region which goes from Dún Laoghaire to Stepaside and takes in Dundrum, Blackrock, Shankill and Cabinteely, the numbers dropped from 18 in 2009 to four in 2023 and rose to nine the following year, where they have remained. In Laois/Offaly there were 42 dedicated roads policing officers in 2009 which fell to 24 in 2023 and dropped to 18 in April this year. “It is very disappointing,” said Ms Gray. “Everybody talks about road safety being a priority and everywhere we look it’s obvious it’s not a priority,” she said. “We hoped to see the figures going up rather than down for gardaí involved in roads policing.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter Marie O’Halloran is Parliamentary Correspondent of The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, who first reported the news, that the bank will also begin taking crypto holdings into account when assessing clients' net worth and liquid assets. This would mean that crypto gets the same treatment as real estate and vehicles when assessing a client's ability to repay a loan. "We can confirm the contents of the Bloomberg story are accurate," a JP Morgan spokesperson told Decrypt in an email. The bank has had a love-hate relationship with Bitcoin. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has long been a Bitcoin skeptic, but recently said the bank would begin allowing customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum. The billionaire banker has said that Bitcoin is a "pet rock" and that crypto's "true use case" was for criminals. But the bank has long used blockchain—a technology launched by Bitcoin's creator—for its own projects to move money. JP Morgan is the latest high-profile traditional finance giant to offer clients exposure to crypto—a multi-trillion dollar asset class. The likes of Fidelity and Standard Chartered have also this year launched digital asset trading services for both institutional and retail clients. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, giving investors previously shut out from the crypto investing world the ability to buy and sell digital assets via shares that trade on a stock exchange. Managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, the funds have been highly popular, with the Bitcoin products having the most successful launch in the history of ETFs. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has led the charge, and currently has over $70 billion in assets under management. Editor's note: This story was updated to add a comment from JP Morgan.

Title: The Convergence of TradFi and Digital Asset Markets – A Maturing Ecosystem

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The line between traditional and crypto markets is actively being redrawn. As digital asset markets mature, the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and digital markets is accelerating, resulting in a more mature, institutional-grade ecosystem shaped by the frameworks, expectations and operational resilience that have historically characterized TradFi. Recent developments underscore a paradigm shift in how digital assets are perceived by institutions. The U.S. government’s announcement of a strategic digital asset reserve, consisting of bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, signals strong institutional validation. In parallel, more than eleven U.S. states have shown interest in or are actively working on bitcoin treasury bills. Sovereign investors such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) have disclosed significant positions, with a $436.9 million stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) as of December 31, 2024. These aren’t speculative moves, but rather concerted investments to stay at the forefront of an evolving financial system. Support from these governments is reinforcing institutional engagement, marking a turning point where the risk of missing out outweighs the risk of exposure to the digital assets ecosystem. Previously, institutional participation in digital assets was constrained by high volatility, regulatory uncertainty and fragmented infrastructure. Now, regulated custodians offer institutional-grade solutions, while trading platforms provide improved access and reliable execution. The expansion of risk management tools — including hedging, credit facilities and market surveillance — has enhanced the operational stability for a space once known for volatility. These developments have lowered barriers to entry, enabling traditional institutions to approach digital assets with familiar risk and compliance frameworks. Institutional adoption is further fueled by products that mirror traditional markets while leveraging blockchain advantages. Today’s institutional offerings include spot & derivatives markets, yield-bearing products, ETFs & in-kind redemptions and depositary receipts — all designed with similar underwriting logic and performance expectations. The expansion of futures, options and structured products in crypto mirrors the mechanics of TradFi derivatives. These instruments provide price discovery, risk hedging and speculative capabilities that align with institutional mandates. Yield-bearing products like staking, crypto lending and tokenized fixed-income are being designed with yield profiles resembling TradFi. These structures provide fixed or floating returns while incorporating risk metrics familiar to institutions. One of the most popular products has been spot bitcoin ETPs. Nasdaq’s proposed in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF further align crypto ETFs with traditional counterparts, boosting efficiency and liquidity. Additionally, crypto depositary receipts enable institutions to access digital assets without direct custody, bridging traditional markets and crypto in a regulated, familiar structure. Institutional investors are engaging through structures that blend traditional and digital techniques: hybrid funds, separately managed accounts (SMAs) and bespoke mandates. These tailor exposure while maintaining operational familiarity, providing institutions with regulated pathways to participate in this evolving ecosystem. Regulatory clarity remains critical. Recent SEC moves and a more crypto-forward administration signal openness to clearer frameworks, encouraging increased institutional engagement. Some traditional players are still taking a wait-and-see approach, cautiously observing market infrastructure and regulatory signals before committing capital at scale. On the other hand, firms like BlackRock, Fidelity and Citadel are entering the DeFi space. Institutional adoption is unlocking portfolio diversification, enhanced market efficiency and a more structured approach to risk management, all pointing to a more robust financial ecosystem. The institutionalization of digital assets and its convergence with traditional financial systems is not a passing trend, but a structural realignment of markets. Forward-looking institutions are not just participating, they’re supporting the emerging ecosystem. For CIOs and allocators, this convergence presents an inflection point. The ability to navigate digital assets with TradFi discipline and DeFi innovation is becoming a key differentiator — placing emphasis on the importance of partnering with firms who have deep experience across both markets. As the financial landscape evolves, institutions that stay informed and insightful will find themselves positioned to adapt and thrive.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified that his crypto powerhouse never pursued the acquisition of major stablecoin issuer Circle. The statement, which was made during a Las Vegas event, comes after reports claimed that Ripple reportedly offered between $4 billion and $5 billion to purchase Circle. Speaking to Georgetown Law professor Chris Brummer, Ripple asserted that the company was not exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. “Brad was unequivocal — Ripple never pursued an acquisition of Circle. And while he wished the company well, it wasn’t something he was considering,” Brummer revealed in a June 3 post on X, citing a discussion he had onstage at the Ripple Las Vegas conference “48 hours ago.” The session was not broadcast live. Bloomberg was the first to report that Ripple tried to purchase Circle, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low. America’s leading crypto exchange, Coinbase, allegedly made a counterbid. Sources also told Fortune that Circle would sell to Coinbase “in a heartbeat” given their longstanding relationship. Founded in 2013, Circle is a major company in the crypto industry, known as the issuer of USDC, the industry’s second-largest stablecoin by market cap after Tether’s USDT. As ZyCrypto previously covered, the reports of Ripple’s potential takeover of Circle were met with a mixed reaction within the cryptosphere. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson, for instance, suggested that the deal, if successful, could “make the space better.” Meanwhile, MetaLeX Labs founder Gabriel Shapiro speculated that it could lead to a “crypto apocalypse.” “Making Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,” Shapiro had explained at the time. According to a recent SEC filing, Circle is seeking a fully diluted valuation of up to $7.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO). The company will sell up to 32 million shares priced between $27 and $28 each. Circle’s IPO is attracting significant interest from market participants, with the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, reportedly planning to purchase roughly 10% of the offering.

Title: Bitcoin Could Replace Dollar As World’s Reserve Currency Amid Ballooning US Debt Crisis, Coinbase CEO Posits

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicted that Bitcoin might “take over” as the world’s next reserve currency if Congress doesn’t tackle rising national debt quickly. With America’s national debt sitting comfortably around the $37 trillion mark, Armstrong is warning that the burden could one day be the reason the dollar is dethroned by the premier crypto as the reserve currency of the world. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world,” the Coinbase boss said in a June 3 post on the X social media platform. “We need to get our finances under control.” If the electorate doesn't hold congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency.I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control. https://t.co/aeBE7pUuHo His worries over the debt crisis came as House Republicans passed President Donald Trump’s so-called “One big, beautiful bill” in May that extends tax cuts, boosts military spending, and cuts Medicaid, food aid, and clean energy. Six Nobel Prize-winning economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, argued in a June letter that the bill’s structural design would increase inequality and add over $3 trillion to the US debt. Fears of inflation and fiscal strain fuel strong interest in Bitcoin, an anti-inflationary asset with a fixed supply. Investors wary of the government’s apparent failure to rein in its spending are preparing for runaway inflation over the long term by pivoting to the top crypto as the safer bet than the dollar. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also slammed the bill on Tuesday, calling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.” Musk collaborated with Trump to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), which triggered controversy due to the agency’s aggressive approach to target various government departments to identify and recommend cost cuts to Trump and Congress. But the wheels have fallen off that initiative. Musk has clarified that he will dedicate most of his time to Tesla, SpaceX, and his other companies from now on. Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong isn’t the only person concerned about what might happen if America runs out of people to buy its soaring debt. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that America’s rising national debt threatens the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, potentially leading to decentralized assets like Bitcoin taking its place. Bitcoin has historically served as a safe haven during economic tumult, such as the pandemic, and could benefit long-term from eroding trust in fiat systems, especially with the US fiscal outlook worsening. Meanwhile, US President Trump has previously floated using Bitcoin to solve the mounting sovereign debt crisis.

Title: Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know
URL: https://time.com/7291023/citigroup-firearms-policy-reversal-trump-conservatives-banks-pressure/

Reporter A street view of a Citibank branch in San Francisco, Calif., on May 13, 2025. Reporter Citigroup has reversed its policy restricting banking services to retail clients selling firearms, ending the practice that was put into place in 2018. In a statement shared on June 3, the bank said that the decision had been made in response to concerns raised over “fair access” to banking services. As a result, Citigroup said it would “no longer have a specific policy as it relates to firearms.” The reversal comes after criticism from President Donald Trump and other conservatives regarding “de-banking,” citing what they believe to be unfair practices from U.S. banks preventing conservatives from using their services. Advertisement Advertisement Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos virtually in January, Trump said: “Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business,” taking aim at U.S. bank CEOs. Here’s what to know about Citigroup’s reversal and how it fits into wider discussions about banks and politics in America. Citigroup outlined the specifics of its previous restrictions, saying: “Our U.S. Commercial Firearms Policy was implemented in 2018 and pertained to sale of firearms by our retail clients and partners. The policy was intended to promote the adoption of best sales practices as prudent risk management and didn’t address the manufacturing of firearms.” Since 2018, Citigroup had restricted its services to retail clients selling firearms, requiring them to adhere to three practices. Under the policy, “new retail sector clients or partners,” clients could not sell firearms to those who hadn’t passed a background check, had to restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21, and could not sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. In its June 3 update, the bank said that after reviewing its policies, it will be updating its "Employee Code of Conduct" and its "customer-facing Global Financial Access Policy," to clearly state that the Citigroup does "not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation." “These changes reinforce our commitment to serve all clients fairly, and we will continue to work with regulators and elected officials on ways to improve transparency and trust in the banking sector,” the statement continued. The banking service introduced new restrictions in March 2018 following a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14 of that year, which left 17 people dead. The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, aged 19 at the time, was able to obtain firearms after a background check, despite previous warning signs. Both Cruz’s age and circumstances were addressed in Citigroup’s firearm policy. Not allowing retailers to sell bump stocks was also included in the bank’s 2018 policy, after the device was used during a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017. A bump stock allows semi-automatic rifles to fire at a higher rate, and were banned by the Trump Administration in December 2018. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down this ban in 2024. After the shooting in Parkland, Florida, investment management firm BlackRock also announced that it would be asking for further details and information on business practices from firearms manufacturers and retailers. In April 2018, Bank of America said that it would be restricting firearms-related business and would stop lending money to manufacturers that make military-inspired weapons to be used by civilians. In particular, Bank of America started to wind down relationships with manufacturers that produced AR-15 style rifles that have been used in mass shootings. In 2024, Bank of America loosened some of its restrictions surrounding lending to the firearms and energy industries, amid pressure from politicians in Texas and Florida. Criticism amongst conservatives and Republicans have long been aimed at banking institutions for imposing restrictions on firearms and other issues. In 2022, a number of conservative-led states considered a number of new bills, with some passing, penalizing banks for such policies. According to Reuters, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs were all sidelined by state law that barred firms from the municipal bond market if they were found to “discriminate” against the firearms industry in the state. In April 2024, over a dozen Republican state attorneys general addressed a letter to The Bank of America, raising their concerns with the bank’s “de-banking policies and practices threaten the company’s financial health, its reputation with customers, our nation’s economy, and the civil liberties of everyday Americans.” Within the letter, Bank of America was criticized for “systemic biases” against political views. The letter cited a report in which the bank is said to have shared a list with the FBI of anyone who had bought a firearm with a credit or debit card from the bank in Washington, D.C., in the days surrounding the Capitol Riots on Jan. 6, 2021. “We are shocked that Bank of America would so cavalierly disregard its customers’ privacy and their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights at the behest of the federal government,” the letter continued. Shortly after his inauguration in January, Trump launched criticism at banks, in particular at the Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking directly to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Trump said: “The Bank of America, they don’t take conservative business… you, Jamie (Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong.” In response, Bank of America said that it “welcomes conservatives” as part of the 70 million customers that it serves. “We would never close accounts for political reasons and don't have a political litmus test,” the bank said in a statement after Trump’s remarks. Elsewhere, the Trump Organization sued Capitol One in March, accusing the bank of closing hundreds of accounts belonging to the company. In its complaint, the Trump Organization said it believes “that Capital One’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views.” The complaint argued that Capitol One’s decision was “part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer’s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution.” Capitol One responded, requesting that the lawsuit be thrown out, and in turn arguing that the Trump Organization’s complaint “fails to provide any factual or legal support for the claims asserted, requiring dismissal on several grounds.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: Pension Funds Have Had It With Tesla’s Board And Musk

ByAlan Ohnsman ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. When Elon Musk appeared in the White House last week at a ceremony with President Donald Trump marking the end of his controversial role leading the federal job-slashing DOGE initiative, he sported a shiner on his right eye that he claimed came from toddler son X. That literal black eye will heal, but the figurative ones Tesla and Musk’s reputation have received from his political activities are likely to linger. Some of Tesla’s biggest shareholders — including unions like the American Federation of Teachers, whose 1.8 million members participate in pension funds with $4 trillion of assets under management, including $8.8 billion of Tesla shares — see one group as largely to blame: the EV company’s board. “People don't like Elon Musk,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told Forbes. “We've taken the position over the course of the last few months of: ‘Do your job board. Do your job financial industry. Do the job you're supposed to do, which is the governance of Tesla.’” “Make sure he’s there or get another CEO” Weingarten and the teacher’s union have been pushing fiduciary officers overseeing major state and city pension funds, as well as investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and TIAA, to review their Tesla holdings and pressure the board to change its ways. “We don't want Tesla to fail because if Tesla fails that means a lot of retirees are going to lose a lot of money in terms of their portfolios,” Weingarten said. She added: “If you're going to have Musk there, then make sure he's there. Don't have him do these extracurricular activities. Make sure he’s there or get another CEO.” Nine state treasurers and comptrollers sent a letter to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in April raising concerns about risks to their economies if the company falters because of poor board governance. “No other publicly traded company CEO would've been allowed to neglect his day-to-day duties like Musk has. No exception,” said Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who signed the letter. “And if they had undertaken personal activities that hurt the reputation of a company or brand that badly, would they be treated like he has been?” CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund representing public workers in California, had no specific comment on Tesla and said its investments are “are index-oriented and optimized using systematic and quantitative investment strategies, not driven by any single period’s events.” However, it sold 4.5 million Tesla shares in the third quarter of 2024. The fund held about 9.4 million Tesla shares as of its last annual filing, a stake worth $3.2 billion as of June 3. Tesla fell 2.9% to $332.05 on Wednesday. The shares are down about 18% this year. Musk for years has divided his time as Tesla chief with leadership roles at SpaceX, X, The Boring Co., Neuralink and xAI, but his Trump administration job proved particularly harmful to the brand, spurring protests at Tesla stores and vandalism of its vehicles and facilities. A poll conducted by Washington-based GBAO last month found that Musk was viewed unfavorably by 55% of the 2,000 Americans it surveyed, while Tesla ranked as the least favored brand among poll participants who have or are considering getting an electric vehicle. Most importantly, 51% of survey respondents said they’d view Tesla more favorably if the world’s wealthiest human were replaced as CEO. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” Musk has now said he’s stepped back from his DOGE duties and Tesla stock has rallied in the past few weeks, jumping more than 50% since April 21, as many investors appear hopeful he’ll be more engaged in leading the company, particularly as it prepares to launch a pilot robotaxi program in Austin this month. He’s even shown signs of breaking with Trump, labeling the the president’s so-called Big Beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday because of how much it increases the federal deficit. GBAO GBAO Principal Margie Omero, who oversaw the Musk-Tesla survey, isn’t sure the billionaire’s latest moves will make a difference. “He may say he's stepping away but his involvement with Trump, both in helping to elect him and in helping enact Trump's wishes in government, all those things are not going to change. They’re not over,” she said. Pollster GBAO focuses mainly on progressive issues and notes that Tesla’s core customer base and EV buyers generally tend to identify as Democrats. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” “Tesla's brand has suffered dramatically alongside Elon Musk's brand–in some ways they’re one and the same,” said Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, also a signatory to the April letter to board chair Denholm. Maryland’s State Retirement Agency currently has about $175 million invested in Tesla through pooled accounts. “As somebody who keeps an eye on the returns of our retirement portfolio and our investments, I am always looking to make sure that our retirees and their hard-earned retirement dollars are invested wisely–and with companies governed by boards we can trust and who are engaged in responsible business practices,” Lierman said. GBAO Musk’s behavior and unrestrained comments on social issues have persisted for years, from his false claim in 2018 that he’d lined up funding to take Tesla private. The same year he called a critic “pedo guy” and had to go to court to defend his comments in a defamation trial because of it. During a 2020 earnings call meltdown, he decried emergency public health rules at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as “fascist.” More recently, he gave what looked like a Nazi-style salute at a Trump victory rally, and in February wildly waved a chainsaw around onstage at a conservative political conference. Recent and detailed reports of his use of drugs including ketamine and Adderall haven’t helped. Denholm didn’t respond to a request for comment. Weingarten, Frerichs and Lierman said they’ve had no response from Tesla’s board from their letters. Weingarten said AFT is weighing potential legal action against Tesla’s board, though hasn’t made a final decision on the matter. Musk “has done huge damage to the Tesla brand and Tesla’s reputation,” she said. “If boards are not going to do their job, outside pension funds, including advocates of them, are going to try to force these boards to do their jobs.”

UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan discusses the significance of President Donald Trump’s visit, trade deals and more on ‘Special Report.’ President Donald Trump’s recent visit to the UAE marked a pivotal moment for UAE-U.S. bilateral relations, shining a spotlight on a shared vision for the future. As the UAE and the "New Gulf" pivot from oil to cutting-edge technologies, our partnership with the U.S., rooted in decades of trust, has become a beacon of what’s possible when nations collaborate. This trust has paved the way for a bold new chapter: a strategic economic alliance poised to create tens of thousands of high-tech, energy and manufacturing jobs, driving prosperity in both of our countries. At the heart of this collaboration lies the new U.S.-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership. This initiative will advance cooperation in artificial intelligence and other transformative technologies while spurring investment flows between our nations. TRUMP REVERSES COURSE ON MIDDLE EAST TECH POLICY, BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO COUNTER CHINA? A cornerstone of this effort is the establishment of a 10-square mile state-of-the-art AI campus in Abu Dhabi, the largest outside the U.S.. With five gigawatts of AI data center capacity, it will act as a vital hub for U.S. hyperscalers or large cloud service providers and large enterprises, serving partners and friends across the region and in the global south. President Donald Trump and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan talk on Thursday, May 15. (AP/Alex Brandon) To support this vision, the UAE and U.S. governments have agreed on a pathway for the UAE to acquire advanced American AI semiconductors. A handful of U.S. voices have begun to raise concerns about the security of this technology. The fact is that we understand these concerns and fully agree that access to sensitive technologies comes with great responsibility. SILICON, STEEL AND MEGAWATTS: CAN AMERICA CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO WIN THE AI RACE? Importantly, this new partnership sets a global benchmark for securing advanced U.S. technology. Through the implementation of a "Regulated Technology Environment," approved UAE organizations acquiring regulated US technologies will adhere to extensive physical and cybersecurity protocols. These involve regular audits, third-party validations and active oversight by both nations’ governments. The direct involvement of leading U.S. companies further ensures that advanced AI chips and technologies are fully protected from diversion or unauthorized access. This is nothing new. These measures underscore our commitment to a long-term, trusted technology partnership with the U.S. that builds on decades of collaboration. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The UAE previously established the Executive Office for Control and Non-Proliferation with the mission to enhance export controls and prevent the unauthorized transfer of dual-use military/civilian items and technologies. For over 25 years, the UAE has deployed cutting-edge American defense technologies, from F-16 fighter jets to THAAD missile systems. And the strict safeguards in a landmark 2009 agreement have enabled the UAE access to U.S. civilian nuclear energy know-how and cooperation. WHITE HOUSE THANKS UAE FOR AGREEING TO 10-YEAR, $1.4 TRILLION INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK Further confirming this mutual trust, UAE-backed GlobalFoundries manufactures America’s most classified microchips for defense and advanced computing in upstate New York and Vermont. As a key part of the new partnership, UAE companies will expand these technology investments into new U.S. data centers, digital infrastructure and energy projects, critical to powering the AI revolution. These measures underscore our commitment to a long-term, trusted technology partnership with the U.S. that builds on decades of collaboration. This partnership is a two-way street. U.S. companies are also doubling down on their presence in the UAE. Microsoft is partnering with G42, Google is launching a Cyber Security Excellence Center in Abu Dhabi, and Raytheon is opening a new UAE production facility. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Major U.S. financial institutions, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, have set up shop in Abu Dhabi, while Wynn Resorts and Disney are developing landmark projects in the Emirates. From Abu Dhabi to Atlanta, Dubai to Detroit, and Ras Al Khaimah to Reno, investment is flowing, technology is advancing and businesses are thriving. The recent meeting between President Trump and UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan wasn’t just a celebration of past achievements, it was a launchpad for what’s next. This partnership isn’t just about quick wins; it’s about building a shared future of innovation, opportunity, and prosperity. Together, the UAE and the U.S. are crafting a legacy that will not only benefit our two nations but also inspire progress around the world for decades to come. Yousef Al Otaiba is the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the United States and Minister of State. His time in Washington, D.C. has been marked by several bilateral accomplishments in the fields of security, civil nuclear energy, health, education, culture and more. Among his biggest successes thus far include his involvement in the US-UAE 123 Agreement and the Abraham Accords normalization pact between the UAE and Israel in 2020.

Title: Best crypto to buy as Truth Social files for a Spot Bitcoin ETF
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/best-crypto-to-buy-as-truth-social-files-for-bitcoin-etf/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T08:43:50Z
Full Content:
In a surprising move that sent ripples through the crypto market, Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has officially filed to launch a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing, submitted through the parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), marks a notable pivot into digital assets, suggesting growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. The development has sparked renewed enthusiasm among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, with meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe also riding the wave of attention and experiencing a surge in investor interest. According to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), TMTG aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and investor demand by offering a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin contracts, a spot ETF would directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors exposure to real BTC prices without needing to manage a digital wallet. The move places Truth Social in the company of major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who launched similar products earlier this year. However, TMTG’s entrance into the ETF space is particularly notable given its political backing and its predominantly conservative user base, potentially opening up Bitcoin exposure to a new demographic of retail investors. The filing is already leading to increased speculation in altcoins, especially high-potential meme coins such as Bitcoin Pepe, as traders look for ways to ride the momentum. While the ETF filing directly concerns Bitcoin, its ripple effect is being felt across the broader crypto market – especially in the meme coin segment. Historically, meme coins thrive during periods of heightened mainstream attention and speculation. The association of Donald Trump’s brand with a financial product tied to crypto reintroduces an entertainment and political angle that energizes retail participation. As capital flows into Bitcoin via ETFs, retail investors often seek cheaper, higher-upside alternatives – and meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe are prime candidates. The political spectacle, media buzz, and renewed focus on crypto could create the perfect storm for meme coin rallies in the coming months. In the sea of meme coins that have flooded the crypto market this year, Bitcoin Pepe is a standout since it has raised more than $13 million during the presale, indicating strong interest in its utter commitment to instant transactions and ultra-low fees. Plus, Bitcoin Pepe is now only 13 days away from a CEX listing that typically leads to a new wave of demand, which often results in significant price increase. With Bitcoin’s visibility rising due to Truth Social’s ETF ambitions, meme coins tied to Bitcoin’s branding – like Bitcoin Pepe – are also gaining traction. As a hybrid of two cultural forces in crypto (Bitcoin and the iconic Pepe meme), Bitcoin Pepe offers strong viral potential, particularly among Gen Z and meme-savvy traders.

Title: Texas Removes BlackRock From Energy Boycott Blacklist

More Info Texas has removed BlackRock from its list of oil and gas investment boycotters after the asset manager shrank its ESG footprint, ending a three-year quiet confrontation that saw Texas state investment vehicles pull billions out of BlackRock. “I am pleased to announce a significant decline in the number of investment funds that boycott the oil and gas industry, as well as the removal of BlackRock Inc. from the Comptroller's office list of companies that boycott energy companies,” Texas State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement. “Directly related to our listing process, BlackRock has stepped back from full participation in the Climate Action 100+ and completely exited the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. It has dramatically reduced the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas, and it shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future,” Hager also said. The saga began back in 2022, when Texas passed legislation forbidding state agencies from investing in any of a number of companies that, the state’s government said, boycotted the oil and gas industry. The black list of such companies included many Wall Street heavyweights eager to get a piece of the energy transition business. BlacRock was among the most prominent entities featured on the list. The asset manager protested its inclusion in the list, saying it has investments in the oil and gas industry and no plans to quit these. The firm noted $120 billion in investments in Texas public energy companies, out of a total of $320 billion in energy investments globally. Nevertheless, the Texas Permanent School Fund withdrew some $8.5 billion in investments from the fund manager last year. BlackRock, by the way, is not the only one quitting various net-zero alliances, at least in part as a result of the pressure campaign of conservative U.S. state governments against the anti-oil and gas shift, but also in response to constantly tightening reporting and emission-tracking requirements originating within these alliances.

Title: Bitcoin Moves With Gold And M2 Money Supply – Next Rally Loading?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-moves-with-gold-and-m2-money-supply-next-rally-loading/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T08:00:15Z

Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly mirroring gold’s historic price performance and the trajectory of the global M2 money supply, prompting crypto analysts to forecast a potential major rally for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Jelle shared the following chart that reveals a recurring pattern – gold tends to lead Bitcoin, which subsequently “catches up” in price action. This relationship underscores the growing perception of BTC as digital gold. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements have aligned with those of gold, driven by similar macroeconomic dynamics such as inflation, expansive monetary policy, and investor demand for scarce assets. As gold continues to rally amid rising global liquidity and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin appears to be following suit. Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value is also gaining traction among institutions. Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, recently described BTC as a “superior alternative” to gold – a strong endorsement from the world’s largest asset manager. Meanwhile, another analyst, CryptoGoos, drew attention to BTC’s tendency to follow shifts in the global M2 money supply. He noted that Bitcoin often lags behind increases in M2 by roughly two months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may soon witness another rally. For the uninitiated, the global M2 money supply refers to the total amount of money circulating in the economy, including cash, checking deposits, and other similar monetary instruments. An increase in M2 often signals monetary expansion, which can lead to inflation and push investors toward assets like gold and Bitcoin as hedges. From a technical perspective, BTC is also showing bullish signs. In an X post today, seasoned analyst Titan of Crypto pointed out that Bitcoin has formed a golden cross on the four-hour chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average (MA), typically the 50-day MA, crosses above a long-term average, such as the 200-day MA. The golden cross is widely regarded as a bullish indicator and may signal further upside. Various metrics suggest that the BTC rally is far from over yet. For instance, Titan of Crypto recently stated that BTC is following the Golden Ratio Multiplier, targeting $130,000. Similarly, crypto enthusiast KillaXBT predicted a BTC price of $120,000 by mid-June. However, there are some risks to monitor to avoid getting caught up in a price crash. Analysts caution that if Bitcoin falls below the critical support range of $97,000 – $99,000, it could trigger a sharper correction. At press time, BTC trades at $106,610, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Wanted: Independent directors for PSU boards. But where is the approval?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Over three-fourths of India’s listed public sector enterprises do not have the requisite number of independent directors, as these companies continue to wait for clearance from various government departments. As many as 62 out of 79 listed PSUs lack the mandated number of independent directors, according to data from Prime Database. Despite repeated regulatory reminders, these companies await clearances from their respective ministries, delaying crucial appointments and inviting penalties from stock exchanges. Government-owned firms, including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp, State Bank of India, National Aluminium Company Ltd. and Steel Authority of India Ltd, did not have the minimum number of independent directors as of 2 June, according to Prime Database, a Mumbai-based market data tracking firm. The list of non-compliant PSUs includes banks, oil and gas companies, metals and mining firms, power utilities, telecommunications, railways, and engineering firms. According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing regulations, at least one-third of a listed entity's board members must comprise independent directors. Additionally, if the chairman is an executive director, at least half of the board must consist of independent directors. Also Read: HPCL gets new chief, four more large PSUs in queue Boardroom bottlenecksThere are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels. Additionally, 14 of the listed PSUs are yet to appoint a single woman director, despite gender diversity requirements, according to Prime Database. “It’s ironic that we are asking all private sector companies to comply with these requirements when government-owned companies themselves are non-compliant," said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database. With PSUs failing to comply with the market regulator’s rules, many have been fined by stock exchanges. Last week, National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) was fined ₹33.32 lakh for having only three independent directors—two short of the required five—on its 10-member board. A spokesperson for Nalco said the company was continuously following up with the ministry of mines, its administrative ministry, for the appointment of the requisite number of independent directors. The bottleneck lies in the approval process across various ministries, according to proxy advisory firms. “The Prime Minister’s Office should send a strong message to all concerned ministries and PSU companies that they need to be compliant, as non-compliance by PSUs doesn't send the right message to investors," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm. “For instance, when the government, as a major shareholder, is involved in abusive transactions or there is trouble with key management, independent directors are the custodians of minority shareholders’ interests," Subramanian said. Also Read: India's PSU banks outshine private peers in arresting bad loans Many of the largest money managers, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have voiced their concerns when these companies have sought shareholder approval for the appointment of directors, according to voting disclosures reviewed by Mint. In August last year, Hindustan Aeronautics sought shareholder approval for the appointment of former chairman C.B. Ananthakrishnan. Nearly a fourth of public institutions opposed the decision. “Nominee serves as chair of the board and bears responsibility for lack of independence. Nominee is an executive director on the audit committee," noted BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion in assets under management. In the same month, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. sought shareholders’ approval for the appointment of Pankaj Kumar as a director, but 28.35% of public institutions, including Vanguard, opposed his re-appointment. "There has been an expectation that the exchanges or Sebi will act, more so given the repeat violations, but neither has been able to address this issue," said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. "The solution may be to move these entities out of the control of the administrative ministry and into a direct fund that will focus on governance and value creation," he said Despite these lapses, investor interest in PSUs has surged. The BSE PSU Index, which comprises 63 companies, has outperformed the Sensex over the last five years. The index has gained 301% between 5 June 2020 and 3 June 2025, while the Sensex has risen by 135.5% during this period. There are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels.

More price rally. “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X in comments reposted by Musk. “I love bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” 06/05 update: Elon Musk’s endorsement of Armstrong’s warning comes at a time of increased pressure on the U.S. dollar, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the U.S. dollar will fall to levels not see since the Covid pandemic this year, pushed down by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the rise of rival currencies. "We think rates and currency markets have embarked on sizeable trends that will be sustained — taking the US dollar much lower and yields curves much steeper — after two years of swing trading within wide ranges," the strategists wrote in a note seen by Business Insider, adding they expect the dollar to fall 9% over the next 12 months to a value of 91 on the dollar index. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has added to fears, predicting spiraling U.S. debt may create a "tough time" for the bond market as spreads widen. "If people decide that the U.S. dollar isn’t the place to be, you could see credit spreads gap out; that would be quite a problem," Dimon said during an interview with Fox Business. “It does feel like we’re entering into a more secular downturn for the dollar,” Peter Vassallo, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management who focuses on currencies, told MarketWatch. “The worst-case scenarios surrounding tariffs have been reduced. But the broad ideas around U.S. policy being more volatile and more hostile to foreign trade — that hasn’t gone away.” Musk, who last year embarked on a campaign against spiraling U.S. debt while supporting U.S. president Donald Trump’s second bid for the White House, has come out against Trump’s signature tax bill just days after leaving his role in Trump’s administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the U.S.’s $36 trillion in debt over the next decade, taking it to an eye-watering $40 trillion. "I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore," Musk, who set up and led the Doge department of government efficiency, posted to X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk wrote that those who voted for it “know you did wrong," and added in a follow up post that it “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” Huge government spending through Covid lockdowns turbo-charged U.S. debt, leading to warnings the Federal Reserve will have to step in to prop up bond markets, devaluing the dollar and potentially spiking inflation. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rocketed to a fresh all-time high in May, soaring as fears swirl over the health ... More of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, a scarce digital asset that’s often compared to gold, has seen its price rocket higher as countries around the world, and led by the U.S., fuel their economic growth with debt. Companies are beginning to shift their corporate treasuries to bitcoin, a trend started by ailing software company MicroStrategy in 2020 that’s propelled it into the Nasdaq 100 and been copied by dozens of companies. “As the U.S. dollar continues to devalue, we’re going to see this shift happening more and more as investors scramble to protect their assets,” Nic Puckrin, bitcoin and crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “With bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 for 20 days and counting, it’s fast becoming the new safe haven.”

Title: Ethereum’s big moment: Why institutions are betting big on ETH

BlackRock and Fidelity are rotating out of Bitcoin and betting on Ethereum! Ethereum [ETH] is having a moment — and institutions know it. Capital is rotating fast, with giants like BlackRock and Fidelity quietly trimming their Bitcoin [BTC] positions and loading up on ETH. It’s a strategic move, likely in anticipation of long-awaited ETH staking approval. At the same time, social sentiment is buzzing, and whale activity is picking up, all pointing to a market mood that’s increasingly pro-Ethereum… even as some big holders are still underwater. Institutions are making their play, and it’s not Bitcoin they’re betting on! On the 2nd of June alone, BlackRock and Fidelity unloaded a combined $180 million in BTC, as shown in the latest ETF net inflow data. Where did that capital go? Straight into Ethereum. Source: SoSoValue Reports suggest nearly 30,000 ETH — valued around $78 million — were scooped up by the same players. The shift is clear: Institutional capital is front-running a potential ETH staking approval, rotating aggressively into what’s increasingly seen as the future of digital assets. According to Santiment data, for every bearish post on ETH, there are three bullish ones, reflecting a euphoric tone among traders. Source: Santiment In contrast, Bitcoin’s ratio is a modest 1.3:1, suggesting a more cautious outlook. The divergence in mood shows growing confidence in Ethereum’s near-term potential, especially amid ETH staking approval rumors. As the crypto crowd leans into optimism for ETH, the gap in sentiment between the two leading assets continues to widen. Even whales aren’t immune to losses, but their moves still matter. A prominent Ethereum whale, who accumulated over 13,478 ETH ($49M) between December 2024 and January 2025, has recently started offloading ETH to Binance, sending 10,000 ETH ($24.55M) in the last two weeks alone. Source: X Despite a $15.66M loss, the whale still holds 3,478 ETH; suggesting a planned move, not panic. It reflects how big players are repositioning ahead of possible ETH staking approval.

The company behind the second-largest USD-pegged stablecoin by market cap is naming its price for its upcoming US initial public offering (IPO). According to a Reuters report, USDC-issuer Circle says it is aiming for a $7.2 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO – about $28 per share – partially because of the current administration’s friendlier outlook on crypto regulations. US dollar-pegged stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. Tether’s USDT is the largest USD-pegged stablecoin by market value. Says Chief Investment Officer of Running Point Capital, Michael Ashley Schulman, “Issues regarding memecoin hype and more specifically Trump’s ventures into a namesake coin should not directly affect the outlook for stablecoins backed by hard currency.” According to the widely followed pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse, the Circle IPO valuation is “cheap.” “Circle IPO seems interesting to me. I think $28 is going to look cheap over a multi-month period. Outside of the initial event volume, I will be looking for price to develop a clean range and ideally start to establish a longer-term position.” Bloomberg reports that BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, plans on accumulating 10% of Circle’s shares when they become available on Thursday, June 5. BlackRock is already the acting reserve manager for the assets backing USDC. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

BlackRock signals $100T advisor interest in Bitcoin market as metrics point to an incoming institutional demand. Bitcoin [BTC] might be preparing for its next big wave of institutional flows. Financial planners with more than $100 trillion in assets under management might get easier access to BTC exposure in the near term, per BlackRock reports. This has infused new bullish sentiment in the market. Institutional demand for Bitcoin is not novel, but they are accelerating rapidly. As regulatory landscapes shift and spot ETFs become more mainstream, advisors now have a more transparent path to including BTC in diversified portfolios. BlackRock’s announcement follows this trend and implies that the next round of demand will come from wealth managers who had been sidelined in the past. The market is responding in real-time. Since big-ticket institutional investment picked pace, Bitcoin Open Interest has recorded a steady and uninterrupted rise. The trend suggests growing confidence among traders that there is a supply-demand gap brewing. Derivative Open Interest is also likely to mirror the volume of money going into options and futures. Its current consistent rise suggests that big institutions are betting on volatility—typically looking forward to a significant price movement. At present, the direction remains bullish. Source: CryptoQuant Alongside the rising Open Interest, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate has also increased. An increasing Funding Rate indicates that more traders are going long—expecting prices to go up. Such a shift usually precedes bullish breakouts, especially if it comes with institutional news. However, increasing Funding Rates can also introduce short-term volatility. Over-enthusiastic longs can lead to steep corrections, but if institutional flows do materialize, dips can be countered by intense buying. Source: CoinGlass Everyone turns to Bitcoin’s supply side these days. With only 21 million coins and dwindling flow from miners following the halving, increased institutional demand may form the foundation of a supply shock. Unlike retail traders, institutions carry long term goals and like to lock up supply. Once advisors who oversee trillions of dollars begin deploying even small percentages of their portfolios into action, supply from exchanges may disappear in a flash, taking BTC further.

American investors exit Bitcoin ETFs while European retail taps into new opportunities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have entered a third consecutive day of outflows, shedding more than $1 billion. This trend reflects a shift in institutional sentiment as Bitcoin’s price continues to hover around the $105,000 mark without a clear breakout. Data from SoSoValue shows that the 12 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced $268 million in net outflows on June 2 alone. This follows larger exits on May 29 and 30, when the funds collectively lost more than $1 billion. Industry analysts suggest that these outflows are tied to the broader market cooling. Bitcoin’s price has traded in a tight band over the past week, prompting large investors to reduce risk or shift capital to other asset classes. This behavior is common during periods of price consolidation, where expectations of near-term gains are muted. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF in the US, has not been immune to the trend. However, that has not significantly impacted its position among the country’s top 25 largest ETFs. IBIT currently manages over $72 billion in assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted IBIT’s rapid rise in a recent analysis. He noted that at just 1.4 years old, IBIT is the youngest ETF in the top 25, which is significantly younger than any of its peers. Despite Bitcoin’s recent price performance, institutional investors in other jurisdictions remain interested in the flagship digital asset. On June 3, Jacobi Asset Management expanded access to its Bitcoin ETF by removing long-standing investment restrictions. The change allows retail investors in Europe to directly invest in the product, following a decision by Guernsey’s regulator to scrap the professional-only classification and minimum capital requirements. Jacobi CEO Peter Lane welcomed the change, saying: “Our fund was designed from day one with a regulated, institutional-grade structure that investors could trust and were familiar with. Now, with greater regulatory alignment and growing public interest, we’re delighted to expand access to all investors across eligible jurisdictions.” He also praised Guernsey’s proactive approach and expressed optimism about the potential to roll out more regulated crypto investment vehicles soon.

Title: Meta Won’t Add Bitcoin To Balance Sheet As Shareholders Strongly Reject Treasury Proposal
URL: https://zycrypto.com/meta-wont-add-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-as-shareholders-strongly-reject-treasury-proposal/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T13:50:29Z

Shareholders of Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have voted against a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. According to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an eye-popping 4.9 billion votes were cast in opposition while 3.92 million — a mere 0.08% of the total — supported the proposal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company’s voting power, an April regulatory statement reveals, which could mean that he voted down the idea. The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate. Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Title: Russia’s Banking Behemoth Bets On Bitcoin With New Bond Offering

Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, has started offering a new bond product tied to Bitcoin’s price. Based on reports, only qualified investors can buy these bonds right now, and trading happens over the counter. The bank says it will soon list them on the Moscow Exchange to make them easier to buy and sell. These bonds pay out if Bitcoin rises in value, and they also give investors a bonus if the US dollar strengthens against the ruble. Investors deal in rubles, so there’s no need to own a crypto wallet or use foreign platforms. According to the bank’s press release, the bonds are for a limited group of investors at first. They plan to make them available on the Moscow Exchange soon. This move means more transparency and the chance for more people to get involved. If Bitcoin goes up, bondholders benefit. If the dollar goes up against the ruble, bondholders get a bit more too. It’s a double play on two markets, crypto and currency. Based on reports, Russia still bans cryptocurrencies for everyday payments, but they’re allowed for cross-border deals. In early June, the Central Bank of Russia gave financial firms the green light to sell crypto-related investments to qualified investors. That change paved the way for Sberbank’s new bonds. No one needs to leave Russia’s financial system to invest in Bitcoin this way, keeping it all above board and legal. Sberbank got a digital asset license from the Central Bank in 2022. Since then, they’ve tokenized assets like gold and real estate. They opened their platform to retail investors in 2023 and handled billions of rubles in transactions. The bank even launched a blockchain network that works with Ethereum. That network started limited testing in 2022 and opened to the public in early 2023. Now, they’re adding Bitcoin futures on June 4 through their SberInvestments platform. This comes just as the Moscow Exchange rolls out its own crypto-based trading tools. Around the world, big banks are moving into crypto. In the US, names like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are working on a stablecoin project to speed up cross-border payments. In Hong Kong, HSBC launched a crypto settlement product. BNY Mellon is putting money into blockchain to hold digital assets. In March, BlackRock created a tokenized fund on Ethereum and then added one on Solana. Sberbank’s bond ties into this trend, showing that major banks still see value in blending traditional finance with crypto tools.
