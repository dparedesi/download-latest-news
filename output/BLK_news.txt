ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/14 update below. This post was originally published on April 13 Donald Trump’s escalating global trade war has pushed markets to the brink this week, causing a spiralling U.S. dollar "confidence crisis" amid fears of "collapse." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The Federal Reserve, which stepped in to calm markets during the Covid panic, is closely watching the $29 trillion Treasury market for signs convulsions caused by Trump’s tariffs could turn into a full-blown financial crisis (while Wall Street braces for a looming “existential” threat). Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise prediction, a top Federal Reserve official has said it “would absolutely be prepared" to step in to rescue markets if U.S. president Trump’s trade war threatens the financial system. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has triggered chaos on financial markets with his on-again, off-again ... More trade war, tanking stock markets and sending the bitcoin price and crypto markets on a rollercoaster. “We have had to deploy quite quickly, various tools,” Susan Collins, head of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times, referring to previous times the Fed has moved to calm chaotic markets at times of low liquidity or market malfunctions. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” However, Collins, who fears Trump’s tariff trade war could send inflation back above 3% in 2025, said that currently “markets are continuing to function well” and that “we’re not seeing liquidity concerns overall," adding the Fed “does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise.” 04/14 update: JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced to step in and bail out the near-$30 trillion U.S. Treasury market following U.S. president Donald Trump’s campaign of rapid-fire global tariffs. “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations,” Dimon said in a Friday earnings call, warning that the Fed won’t act until “they start to panic a little bit." Dimon suggested the Fed could ditch a rule that exempts Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, something that would allow institutional investors to buy more bonds without breaking capital requirement rules. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The suggestion has been seized on as bullish by Bitmex cofounder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes, who posted to X that: “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.” "[Supplementary leverage ratio] exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital," Hayes added. Earlier this month, traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars—though Collins said emergency rate cuts would not be the Fed’s primary tool for responding to market’s failing. In 2020, ahead of one of the largest ever stock market rallies that saw the bitcoin price and crypto market surge to never-before-seen heights, the Fed restarted its 2008 financial crisis-era programs of quantitative easing while cutting rates to near-zero and scrapping its cap on the number of Treasuries it could buy—fueling expectations the Fed could again turbo charge the bitcoin price. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. Collins’ comments come as the New York Fed’s John Williams has warned that Trump’s tariffs could send inflation spiralling, caused a wave of unemployment and damage U.S. economic growth. This coming week, Fed chair Jerome Powell, who is at loggerheads with Trump over the need for interest rate cuts, is due to speak at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday in what will be a closely-watched speech. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set ahead of Donald ... More Trump's inauguration as global markets convulse over Trump's trade tariffs. Trump’s fast-moving approach to tariffs and trade negotiation—that’s seen China hit with levies of almost 150% before a carve out was announced for smartphones, computers and some other electronics—has seen the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jump 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% over the past week, spooking markets with its outsized swings. Crypto and stock markets have been on a rollercoaster that’s caused some of the most extreme volatility ever seen. After Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs, the S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever following a steep multi-trillion dollar sell-off. The notoriously volatile bitcoin price and crypto market has swung from highs of $3 trillion late March to lows of $2.5 trillion in early April before rebounding back toward $3 trillion. Meanwhile, business leaders on Wall Street and across the U.S. are warning the economy is buckling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned the U.S. may already be in a recession due to Trump’s sweeping tariffs while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon has said recession is the “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade war.

LAST UPDATE | 21 hrs ago THE EMERGING PREFERRED Route for Luas Cork has been launched today by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and is open to public consultation for the next eight weeks. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km long light rail line with up to 24 stops running from Ballincollig to Mahon Point. It will connect key destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. Luas Cork route map The scheme also includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. The Emerging Preferred Route also includes a proposed 1000 vehicle Park & Ride facility in Ballincollig and a Mobility Hub in Mahon. Cork is planned to be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years, with a population targeted to grow by 50 to 60% and projects such as Luas Cork are seen as vital to delivering the large-scale regeneration and investment planned for Cork. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and the National Transport Authority (NTA) is inviting the public to participate in the consultation on www.luascork.ie. The consultation is open until Monday 9 June at 5.30pm. There will also be a number of open days across the city during the consultation where drawings can be inspected and staff from TII will be available to answer questions. Martin described the announcement today of the Emerging Preferred Route a “significant step in an infrastructure project that will be transformational for Cork city”. He added that it is government’s plan to do “whatever we can effectively and in a timely matter”. Advertisement Martin said the project will “modernise the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses”. “With the consultation process now open, I’d encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views,” said Martin. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Darragh O’Brien TD noted that Cork has been selected by the European Commission as one of Europe’s first climate-neutral cities. In 2022, the European Commission announced that Cork is to become one of Europe’s first climate neutral cities. Cork, along with Dublin, was selected from a group of 337 cities to participate in the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030. “The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal,” said O’Brien. “Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality. “The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” O’Brien, who last month said the Luas Cork could cost between €2 billion and €3 billion, added that it’s “very difficult to estimate” how much the project will cost. Lord Mayor of Cork City Dan Boyle meanwhile remarked that the “challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame”. Elsewhere, Hugh Creegan, interim CEO of the NTA said that Luas Cork will be the “new era of public transport which will enable Cork to develop into an accessible, connected and vibrant city” while Peter Walsh, CEO of TII, said he looked forward to hearing from the public before progressing to the next stage of design. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said that she wants to “see things moving very fast”. “It has taken too long,” said Bacik, who called for construction to begin by 2030. “There is a very clear outline coming through and things should move on swiftly and we will be pushing government to make sure it does progress at pace.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Ethereum vs. Ripple: Will XRP overtake ETH in the next 3 years?

Institutional participants show mixed signals as ETH struggles. As Ethereum [ETH] faces mounting pressure, ETF outflows have surged 39% in just one week, signaling shaken investor sentiment. Yet, in a show of confidence, BlackRock has doubled with a massive $1.8 billion ETH position, reinforcing institutional faith in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Just as the dust settles, Standard Chartered has stirred the pot, forecasting that Ripple [XRP] could overtake Ethereum within the next three years. With market dynamics shifting, the race for crypto’s second spot is entering what looks like a high-stakes war zone. Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly net outflows of $82.47 million – marking the largest drawdown in recent months. The chart reveals a clear trend: consistent outflows since mid-February, aligning with Ethereum’s price drop to $1.5K. Source: SoSoValue Total net assets have also steadily declined, now at $5.24 billion, down from a peak above $12 billion in late 2024. This suggests waning short-term investor confidence, even as macro conviction remains strong – evidenced by large institutions like BlackRock increasing exposure. The disconnect hints at a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s market narrative. Despite mounting ETF outflows, BlackRock has solidified its conviction in Ethereum with a $1.8 billion ETH position. The portfolio shows steady accumulation through 2024, signaling a long-term belief in Ethereum’s value proposition. However, a surprising twist enters the frame: Standard Chartered’s latest report forecasts XRP overtaking Ethereum in market cap by 2028. Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research, sees XRP rising to become the second-largest non-stablecoin asset, setting up a high-stakes rivalry. The result is a fascinating divergence in institutional outlooks — one doubling down on ETH, the other betting big on XRP. The mixed signals reveal just how uncertain and dynamic the road ahead for crypto’s top contenders truly is. Ethereum’s price hit $1,603 at press time, following a 2.47% daily drop. The broader trend since early 2025 has been decisively bearish, with ETH shedding significant value from above $3,000 levels earlier in the year. The RSI hovered near 39, indicating oversold territory but not yet signaling a strong reversal. Meanwhile, the MACD line sat just below the signal line, suggesting ongoing bearish momentum — although the gap is narrowing, hinting at potential bullish divergence. Source: TradingView Despite BlackRock’s conviction, technicals suggest ETH is still struggling to find solid footing. Any short-term relief rally could face resistance near the $1,800 zone, while a drop below $1,550 could intensify selling pressure.

Title: Topgolf Founders Raise $34 Million For Poolhouse, Their Latest Sports Startup

ByTim Casey ByTim Casey, Senior Contributor. FILE - David Blitzer participates in a New Jersey Devils press conference Thursday, Aug. 15, 2013, ... More in Newark, N.J. Major League Baseball has approved the sale of a minority stake in the Cleveland Guardians to David Blitzer, who also has ownership shares in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, two people familiar with the deal told the Associated Press on Thursday, June 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Poolhouse, a United Kingdom-based startup founded by the brothers behind Topgolf, has raised $34 million in a seed round. The company plans on using the proceeds to further develop its technology, gain a foothold in the competitive sports-themed entertainment retail industry and open locations where people can play a high-tech version of pool while eating, drinking and socializing. The seed round was co-led by Sharp Alpha, a venture capital firm based in New York, and dmg ventures, the venture capital arm of DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail newspaper among other holdings. David Blitzer, who owns a stake in the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils and invests in sports-focused startups, participated in the round, as did investment firms Simon Sports and Active Partners. Poolhouse declined to disclose the valuation of the company following the seed round, some of which it raised via a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) note that will convert to equity when the company raises a planned Series A next year. Poolhouse is the brainchild of twins Dave and Steve Jolliffe, who in 2000 started Topgolf to enhance the experience of going to a golf driving range. Topgolf merged in 2021 with Callaway in a deal that valued Topgolf at $2.1 billion. There are now 96 Topgolf locations in the U.S. and 12 locations in other countries. The Jolliffe brothers also founded Puttshack, a miniature golf entertainment concept that raised $150 million in October 2022 from Blackrock. There are 16 Puttshack locations in the U.S. and four in the United Kingdom. Poolhouse plans on opening its first venue early next year in London. The 21,348-square-foot, two-story building is located next to the city’s Liverpool Street Station and will house 20 pool tables with food and beverage options. The Poolhouse venues will have regular sized pool tables and pool cues, but the company has developed technology that will enhance the experience, including superimposing images on the table, creating various games people can play and allowing them to track their progress on an app and video screens. The company also has a system that can track how good players are and a handicapping system similar to golf that makes it more competitive among players who have various abilities. Andrew O’Brien, a former Credit Suisse banker who invested in Puttshack and sits on the board of F1 Arcade, is Poolhouse’s CEO and runs its day-to-day operations. Steve Jolliffe is Poolhouse’s executive chairman and speaks with O’Brien every day. The Jolliffes remain the largest individual shareholders in Poolhouse, according to O’Brien. “The look and the feel will be important, but ultimately, it’s what the Jolliffes did with Topgolf,” O’Brien said. “They create amazing technology to transform an existing sport. There's a reason why there weren't any Topgolf rivals for 20 years. It’s because they're very strong on the patent side of things. They don't just design pretty. They design things that are difficult to replicate.” O’Brien added: “With Poolhouse, I think they’ve done something very similar. They've created something on the back of technology, which is real pool tables, real pool balls, real cues. Everything's the same, but they've infused technology into it to augment the experience.” After launching in London, Poolhouse plans on opening two sites in the U.S., one in late 2026 and another in early 2027. The company plans on opening four to five locations per year in the U.S. starting in 2027 in downtown locations of major cities such as Boston, Chicago, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Poolhouse will lease space in buildings rather than own the buildings. Poolhouse has also struck a franchising agreement in Australia with Signature Hospitality Group, which has an equity stake in Poolhouse. Poolhouse expects to sign additional franchising or joint venture agreements in other countries. In addition, the company plans on licensing its technology to traditional pool halls, casinos, restaurants, apartment complexes and even homes or anywhere else that has a pool table. “We think there’s huge scope for this to be scaled across the world at quite a pace,” O’Brien said. Lloyd Danzig, managing partner of Sharp Alpha, said the venture capital firm spent 12 to 18 months evaluating companies in what he refers to as the “competitive socialization” or “eatertainment” industry, referring to Topgolf, Puttshack, F1 Arcade and other companies where people gather to socialize, eat, drink and compete in an activity. Sharp Alpha was looking for companies that had high food and drink spend at its venues, were conducive to corporate events, featured activities that could be done on a regular basis rather than a one-off basis and had proprietary software that could be licensed to a third parties at a high margin. He said he believes Poolhouse will meet all of those criteria. “They, more than any other concept we’ve come across, really embody all four of those features,” Danzig said. “The confluence of what we’re bullish on at the category level and also at the concept level and what they’re building dovetailed with just an absolutely incredible management and executive team. We give these guys an 11 out of 10 on founder-market fit.”

Title: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Secures 'First and Free' Passage for U.S. Ships in Panama Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/13/defense-sec-pete-hegseth-secures-passage-u-s-ships-panama-canal/

PANAMA CITY, Panama — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had one mission on his trip to Panama — to secure a deal to get “first and free” passage for U.S. ships in the Panama Canal, a critical waterway for the United States’ economy and military that was at risk of falling under China’s control. As the secretary and his team flew the down from Washington on Monday evening to meet with Panama’s leaders, such a deal with Panama was far from certain. While the U.S. had built the canal in the early 1900s and maintained it for decades before handing it over to Panama, China had in recent years poured money into projects and infrastructure attached to it. As a passageway between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that handles more than 40 percent of U.S. maritime trade, if China were able to close the canal, it would be a catastrophe for the U.S. President Donald Trump, early on in his administration, made retaking the canal from Chinese influence a top priority. In December, even before he took office for the second time, he posted about it on Truth Social: In February, Trump dispatched Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Panama during his first international trip, where he successfully persuaded Panama to not renew its participation in BRI (the Belt and Road Initiative), a major win for the United States. Then, in March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerated named CK Hutchinson sold two ports along the canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock, which would put the two ports located at each end of the canal under American ownership. Trump touted the deal during his Joint Address to Congress. The Chinese government then launched an investigation into the deal to delay it. Now, it was up to Hegseth to secure U.S. ships’ “first and free” passage through the canal. By all measures, the trip was a resounding success. Hegseth arrived late Monday. On Tuesday, the secretary met with President José Raúl Mulino, Minister of Public Security Frank Abrego, and Panamanian legislators, visited the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base that was formerly a U.S. naval base, and inaugurated a pier refurbished by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He also visited Fort Sherman, a former U.S. Army base, the Jungle Warfare School, toured the Panama Canal by helicopter, and visited the Miraflores Locks. He later met with Abrego again, as well as regional leaders attending the 2025 Central American Security Conference. On Wednesday, Hegseth delivered opening remarks at the conference, which was co-hosted by the U.S. and Panama. It was there that Hegseth announced that the U.S. and Panama would sign a declaration providing a framework for U.S. warships and auxiliary ships to travel “first and free” through the canal, in a huge win for the U.S. Hegseth and Abrego also agreed to an expanded partnership to secure the canal and signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperative security activities between the U.S. and Panamanian militaries, which will see the increase of U.S. troops in Panama. Asked by Breitbart News if he had accomplished everything he wanted to on the trip, a triumphant Hegseth responded, “This trip not only met but exceeded our expectations. A warm welcome from Panama. Great partnership. Spent a lot of time with their troops. I want to thank Panama for what they’ve done in the Darien Gap as well.” The trip was not only a success for the U.S. economically, but also geopolitically. Despite Beijing attempting to pressure Panama by launching an investigation into the CK Hutchison’s sale to the BlackRock-led consortium, Panama remained undeterred in its walkaway from China and reinvigorating its ties with the U.S. A senior defense official told reporters traveling with Hegseth, “If you look at the context of countering Chinese spheres of influence around the world, this is a good example of actions taken by the secretary and by his team about how we align perfectly within the realm of that strategy.” “When we talk about the larger global strategy in deterring China … people start to realize very quickly that an alliance with China is not all it [is] cracked up to be,” the official added. “The [Chinese Communist Party] is very exploitative of the relationships that they have and that wasn’t just true of our time in Panama, it was the also the same in Japan.” Senior defense officials also credited Trump for creating the opportunity and confidence for countries who want to work with the U.S. and leave exploitive relationships with China. “President Trump’s words have resonated with them in terms of negotiating the bolstering of our alliances,” another senior defense official said, adding: President Trump made it a point to talk about Panama within his first 30 days of taking office. … The reason why we’re even having this conversation in the first place is because President Trump focused on on the Panama Canal, and I think it’s going to do lot for our country in terms of opportunity with the Panamanians, but ultimately for our hemisphere. During his visit, China responded angrily to the prospect of further cooperation between the U.S. and Panama, accusing the U.S. of “blackmail.” When asked if he was concerned by retaliation by China, Hegseth responded, “No.” “I’m not worried about retaliation from China. We will stand on our own merits. Peace through strength matters. We represent our interests, put America first, President Trump is staring them down on trade. We will reestablish deterrence as well,” he said. Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on X, Truth Social, or on Facebook. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Investing money into dividend stocks can result in steady cash flow. Gradually putting money into these investments will increase your dividend income over time, but some people receive a windfall of cash that they can deploy right away. One Redditor finds themselves in that position. The individual is set to have $10,000 sometime next week and has been following the Dividends subreddit for a while. Now, after consuming content from the group for a while, the Redditor is looking for advice. "I'm looking for a decent yield and a little growth," the Redditor explained when asking for recommendations. Don't Miss: In addition to the immediate $10,000 investment, the Redditor aims to invest $250 each month. Other Redditors shared their thoughts in the comments. One commenter suggested staggering the $10,000 investment instead of putting it all into the market at once. This approach can help the Redditor capitalize on any price dips instead of unloading all of their capital and watching their assets lose value. Many investors on Reddit seem to be jittery about the recent trade war. The popular consensus on Reddit is that the market will continue to tank, and that fear showed up again in the comments. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. An investor who wants to dollar cost average as the market goes down may want to consider breaking the $10,000 investment into several investments. The amount of times you break down the $10,000 should depend on your risk tolerance, your thoughts about current prices, and what you think the stock market will look like in five to 10 years. The original poster mentioned some ETFs and received comments that suggested some ETFs as well. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD was the first ETF the original poster mentioned. It's no surprise to see SCHD mentioned in the Dividends subreddit since it seems to be a fan favorite. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust SPY, JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, and the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI were some of the other ETFs that were mentioned in the post and the comments. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? However, these recommendations don't mean much since we don't know much about the Redditor. One of the top commenters pointed this out. ‘What to invest in depends a lot on your personal situation. You didn't provide any details about age, income, investment objectives (other than decent yield and a little growth, which is a relative idea), risk tolerance, jurisdiction, investment currency, etc., so it's hard for any meaningful advice to be given." The best stocks and ETFs for one person may be different from the best assets for another person. Some people pursue high-yield stocks as they get closer to retirement, while others buy growth stocks when they are younger to maximize their potential returns. Personal details like risk tolerance and income play a role in which stocks and ETFs make sense for you.

Watch CBS News Updated on: April 13, 2025 / 3:01 PM EDT / CBS News On this "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan." MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's multifront trade war whipsaws markets, and China fires back. What's next, as the world's two biggest economic powers clash? (Begin VT) (CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: The 47th president of the United States! (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: After one of the most volatile weeks in Wall Street history, President Trump spent his Saturday night at a UFC match and hyped his combative approach on trade policy. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We have lots of fights going around the world. And I think we have a lot of good news coming soon about some of those fights. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite backing off of what he called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries and announcing new exemptions on some key consumer products, the president is digging in on tariffs against China. We will discuss what's next with U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. And we will get a read on the economic impact from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari. Silicon Valley's congressman, Democrat Ro Khanna, will weigh in on how the trade war may impact big tech. Plus, we will have a new poll on how Americans think Trump is handling the economy. And, finally, an update on the measles outbreak with the former top vaccine regulator with the FDA Dr. Peter Marks. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Our new CBS poll shows President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 47 percent. That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes. The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers. Speaking with reporters last night, the president said more details would be revealed Monday. For more, we go to United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): Good morning, Margaret. How are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level. Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries. In the past, you've talked – you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan. President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans. And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here. MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a – it's not a brand-new development. You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so – so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So, it's not – it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips. Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen. (Begin VT) HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them. Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is – it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera. So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is – that is subject to study by the Commerce Department. MARGARET BRENNAN: But… AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China. MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are – quote – "exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption." Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8. (Begin VT) NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret. We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we – we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera. They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: … because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced? I mean, he – he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What – what time frame are we talking about? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have – for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's – that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome. (CROSSTALK) AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: …. investigations for those. No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're – you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it… AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that – and that's a Commerce Department function to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of – of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current – including their currency. Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States. In the USMCA and in the Japan-China – the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term. The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has – has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition – you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a – we're in a nefarious situation. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But – but – but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right? So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm – I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming. This was – this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers. I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying? AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I – I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see. I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president – I know you were testifying on – on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs. He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy – quote – "We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart." He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call. AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of – that type of discussion had been happening for – for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart. But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order. So – so lawyer – you know, trade lawyers like – like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's – forms the basis for these tariffs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation. NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America? You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what – yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you – what concerned you? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If – what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up. NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7? NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But, obviously, this is the biggest – in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy. And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession. Is the risk that high, in your estimate? NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is – are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point? NEEL KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're – as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more Face the Nation. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow, CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King will be making history, traveling in an all-woman crew into space. Mark Strassmann has a preview. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): In Blue Origin's training capsule, CBS' Gayle King got a sense of tomorrow's thrill ride, a trip 62 miles straight up to the edge of space. GAYLE KING: And I realize this is so much bigger than just a fun trip, what it represents to young women, to girls, what they're trying to do on space in terms of looking at the planet in another way. MARK STRASSMANN: Space tourism, civilian astronauts, took off four years ago. Three space companies, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, have rocketed more than 120 people into space, including billionaire Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin's founder, in 2021. Did this moment motivate you to push deeper into the cosmos? JEFF BEZOS (FOUNDER, Amazon): Hell yes. (LAUGHTER) JEFF BEZOS: Yes, absolutely, no doubt. We have to build a road to space. The several tourism missions is about practicing. LAUREN SANCHEZ (Journalist): What are we doing? KATY PERRY (Musician): We're going to space. LAUREN SANCHEZ: Oh, we're going to space. MARK STRASSMANN: Bezos' fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, put together Monday's all female-crew, six accomplished women, including King, pop star Katy Perry, two scientists and a filmmaker. Their 11-minute round-trip adventure will include roughly three minutes of weightlessness, floating in the capsule, looking out a window onto the world below. CBS News space analyst Bill Harwood: BILL HARWOOD: It's something we all marvel at, but I think getting from there to the point where the average person can do this is decades away, if not longer. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Liftoff will happen here in West Texas from a launchpad on a mammoth ranch owned by Jeff Bezos. Gayle admits she's both excited and terrified – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we wish Gayle a very safe flight. Our special coverage of the historic mission will begin tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Be sure to tune in. Face the Nation will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from our latest poll on President Trump's economic policies, plus Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna and the former director of the FDA's vaccine program. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right? The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change. But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out. So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now. But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down. But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a - MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now. But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue. Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio. Good morning to you, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area. Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law. MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights. And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional. MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space. But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program. Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there. Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress. And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes. In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term. But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam. So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy. And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam. And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States. So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country? REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy claimed last week that the measles outbreak may be plateauing, but the highly contagious virus continues to spread mostly in unvaccinated people. And the CDC reports that the number of cases topped 700 in 2025 so far. The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states. We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook, earlier this week following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated, people should get the MMR vaccine. Take a listen. DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position, philosophically, of the federal government in terms of public health? ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those. LAPOOK: Understand. But the - KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them. LAPOOK: Right. KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement? PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison. MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration. PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services. Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA? PETER MARKS: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now? PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies. Did you ever speak to him about your concerns? PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying? PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here. You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies. And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience - MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community. PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community. My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around. MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause. On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this. KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures. MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research? PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there. I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong. If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way. And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic. KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD? PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism. There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality. MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent. So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government? PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here. What I think we can expect is the expected, that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You can find our extended interview with Dr. Marks on our YouTube channel or on facethenation.com. We'll be back in a moment.

Watch CBS News Updated on: April 13, 2025 / 1:49 PM EDT / CBS News The following is the transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on April 13, 2025. MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Welcome back to Face the Nation. NEEL KASHKARI: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like 2 billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country? KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag Leader two days ago in Minnesota who said that even if there's a 10% tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China because it's a competitive global market, it's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so in many sectors, whether it's a 10% tariff or 50% or 100% tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil. So looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that? KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, 'Hey, there are other places we also want to invest.' That it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored. MARGARET BRENNAN: So people typically think of US Treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the President says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did? KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the US and around the world are trying to determine what is the new normal in America. You know, I saw an interview on Friday where Blackrock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10 year treasury would go to a 5% yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for where are these trade negotiations going to end up. Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5% treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100% determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see and at the Fed. Our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what, what concerned you? KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near term ups and downs in the economy, but ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the central bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building in the house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If, what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up. KASHKARI: Well there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one time adjustment in prices and nothing longer term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs in a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until what, May 7? KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But obviously we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy, January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But obviously this is the biggest in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I've been at the Fed, except for March of 2020 when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy, and we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45% chance of recession. Is the risk that high in your estimate? KASHKARI: You know it's really going to be determined by are there quick resolutions? To your prior guests. Are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and hopefully those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation if everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself. Setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point? KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously the market participants are trying to grasp for where is this all going to settle, and that's causing volatility as they're, as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected, but markets are functioning, transactions are happening, and so I anticipate that's going to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more. Face the Nation. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Ride The Wave Of Metaphors That Move Markets To Sharpen Your Communication Skills

ByCarmine Gallo ByCarmine Gallo, Senior Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 11: Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, speaks with David Faber and Jim Cramer ... More on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) In these times of turmoil over tariffs, stocks don’t simply move up and down. They don’t merely post a gain or a loss for the week. Instead, they send investors on a ‘roller coaster’ ride as stock prices plummet and plunge, soar and surge. While there’s no telling where the stock market goes from here, one thing we know for sure: financial leaders, writers, and commentators will continue to search for the fewest words to explain the most complex actions. And, to do so, they’ll reach for a metaphor. If you want to be a better communicator—more persuasive and engaging— pay attention to financial writers and commentators who translate complex information into words and ideas that are easy to understand. Effective communication is a skill and like any skill it can be learned. One way to learn a skill is to watch experts do it and to ask questions. In this case, why and when do skilled communicators reach for a metaphor? A metaphor is a figure of speech comparing two different things to show their similarities. When Shakespeare wrote that “Juliet is the sun,” we all know that she wasn’t the actual sun but in those four words we understand that she brightens Romeo’s world. Shakespeare knew the secret all great writers have come to learn: metaphors serve as a cognitive bridge between the intangible and the familiar. They save words, speak volumes, and create vivid images in our minds. The bewildering complexity of global financial movements is far too abstract for most of us to grasp, so we instinctively look for something to compare. When we find a comparison that works, we repeat it. How many times have you read that the economy is in for a “soft landing” or a “hard landing?” We know the economy is not an airplane, but we understand the phrase because it’s a physical sensation we’ve experienced, just like a fall, a crash, or a recovery. My favorite headline of the week comes courtesy of The Wall Street Journal: “Trade-War Jitters Batter Stocks.” It’s impossible to add more metaphors to that headline because every word—including stocks—is a metaphor for an abstract concept. In just five words, the Journal’s headline compresses volumes of complex information: International relations and strategic alliances, policy mechanics, market psychology, and quantitative models. Far from “dumbing down” content, a good metaphor makes it more likely that people will listen to your ideas because you’re making those ideas come alive. They’re more vivid and, as a result, more likely to be remembered. Pay attention to guests who are repeatedly invited to share their outlook on business shows—and pay extra attention to the headlines that come out of those interviews. You’ll find that those who create more intriguing metaphors tend to grab the public’s attention. When JPMorgan Chase released its 2025 Q1 financial results, the press release alone was more than 3,000 words. But CNBC picked up on two words from CEO Jamie Dimon. The economy, he said, is facing “considerable turbulence.” CNBC’s commentators and hosts ran the headline and played off the metaphor for an entire day. The metaphor became the story. Dimon, known for his clearly written annual shareholder letters, carefully selected a metaphor that accurately reflected his opinion. Turbulence is not a crash, but it can get uncomfortable. Turbulence can also be mild or extreme, which is why Dimon also said his company has built a fortress balance sheet that enables the bank to be a pillar of strength during volatile or challenging times. Dimon knows a good metaphor when he sees it, as do financial experts who follow and interpret the markets for the public. Your readers and listeners process complex concepts by reaching for familiar comparisons. Throw them the right metaphor—a cognitive lifeline—and they’ll not only pay attention, they’ll remember you.

Title: Wall Street woes will hammer NYC — so Eric Adams must cut spending NOW

After a week of tariff-driven ups-and-downs in the financial markets, New York City’s economy may soon start feeling woozy. The longtime finance capital stands to lose more than just luster in a rapidly de-globalizing world: Billions in city tax revenue and thousands of jobs are on the line. Greater uncertainty will make foreign and domestic companies more risk-averse, turning them away from dealmaking. Fewer buyouts and mergers mean leaner times — and not just for investment bankers and hedge fund tycoons. It may be hard to pity an industry whose members in the city get bonuses averaging $244,000, but New York runs on Wall Street. Besides generating 20% of Gotham’s total income, finance funds a big chunk of the city’s essential services and safety net. About 23% of the city’s personal income tax collections and 7% of its total tax revenue come from the securities industry, according to state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. That’s more than $5 billion annually out of the current year’s $112 billion budget. History shows that the city’s fortunes are joined at the hip with Wall Street’s. By 1977, Wall Street jobs had dwindled to 70,000, declining by some 30% during that bad old decade. As the city clawed back from fiscal ruin, the finance industry boomed in the Gordon Gekko 1980s, more than doubling employment to 160,000. That set the stage for the extraordinary safety improvements and prosperity of the feel-good 1990s. Today, big banks, hedge funds and asset managers lease space in or own the city’s choicest skyscrapers and spend big bucks on corporate-card dinners, making them indispensable to real estate, restaurants and retail. Yet New York needs Wall Street far more than Wall Street needs New York. Securities jobs in the city peaked in 2000, when they numbered roughly 200,000, and fell after 9/11. A quarter-century later, despite the sector’s enormous growth, the industry accounts for about 195,000 Big Apple jobs. The reason? Competitors like Dallas and Miami are eating New York’s lunch, as firms increasingly choose to locate new operations in the Sun Belt. Texas surpassed the Empire State’s total finance employment a decade ago, and the gap has only widened since. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Citadel Securities have teamed up to launch the Texas Stock Exchange, set to start trading early next year. Just last month, the Nasdaq announced that it will open a new regional headquarters in Dallas. The danger isn’t necessarily that the leading lights of the world’s capital markets are all going to decamp from New York for good. It’s more that they’ll keep a trophy office and smaller staff in the city as a meeting hub — but locate most of their operations and workforce elsewhere. In these other cities, lower housing and living costs allow firms to pay employees less, even as they still take home more at the end of the week. If the national economy slows, these savings will look even more appealing. Meanwhile, many of New York City’s expenses are fixed — and thus depend on a growing local economy.

If your 401(k) balance has made you uneasy lately, just think: The city has to make good on pension promises to some 750,000 current and retired employees. When a stock-market decline doesn’t allow the city’s pension funds to hit their target 7% annual growth rate, Gotham’s taxpayers are on the hook for the difference. The city’s bloated $116 billion FY 2026 budget won’t pay for itself, especially with the Trump administration’s cuts to federal funding. It’s time for Mayor Eric Adams to batten down the hatches and ramp up emergency budget measures until the storm clouds clear. He can start by declaring a hiring freeze across agencies for non-uniformed positions —the opposite of his new proposal to hire 3,700 more city teachers. Instead, he should close failing schools, merge under-enrolled ones, and decrease school-level funding in proportion to enrollment declines. Adding to the city’s $2 billion rainy-day fund — while he still can — would further cushion the blow of a potential recession. The savings account currently amounts to only 1.7% of the annual budget, and hasn’t been growing sufficiently. Adams should freeze spending related to Local Law 97, the de Blasio-era law that mandates big carbon cuts across city operations. Halting these efforts could save up to $2 billion a year. Meanwhile, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development plans to spend at least $700 million annually over the next decade on new low-income housing construction: Trimming this back — and instead allowing the private sector to build more housing without public subsidies — would reduce the city’s debt load and annual interest payments. Spending less money is rarely popular, but Adams shouldn’t wait for a budget crunch before doing the responsible thing. Strong fiscal leadership could even help him stand out among his competitors in November’s general election. After all, when the waters get choppy, a steady hand at the wheel keeps the ship on course. John Ketcham is director of cities and a legal policy fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Title: Our Recession Defense Plan: Giant Monthly Dividends

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Although some tariff hikes have been paused, a recession is still very much in play. Just a few days ago, I wrote that “this is the time to recession-proof our retirement holdings.” And why not? GDP estimates have tanked. So has consumer sentiment. Goldman Sachs made headlines for raising its probability of recession (from 20% to 35%). Fine, but equity analysts often get caught up in crowds. What was more striking was hearing a similar message from the debt watchers. Consider this post from Mark Zandi, Moody’s Analytics’ chief economist: Mark Zandi Recession Tweet Twitter In my previous post, I showed readers how to recession-proof their portfolio with municipal debt. But tax-advantaged munis aren’t the only way to hunker down for the worst. A variety of debt would benefit if Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s campaign to flatten long rates is successful. And we can get the most bang for our buck via closed-end funds (CEFs), which not only deliver much more yield—like the 8.9%-10.7% paydays I’ll highlight today—than comparable exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but can trade at a discount to their net asset value (NAV), meaning we can buy those bonds for less than they’re actually worth. For instance: Western Asset Inflation-Linked Opportunities & Income Fund (WIW)Distribution Rate: 8.9% The Western Asset Inflation-Linked Opportunities & Income Fund (WIW) is an intriguing play if only because the current situation is so unique. The majority of WIW’s holdings (80%+) are inflation-linked securities, largely Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). The rest of its assets are sprinkled around investment-grade corporates, emerging-market bonds, non-agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and other debt. The resulting portfolio is extremely high in credit quality. The play here seems contradictory at first. Trump’s tariffs, if they hold, are widely expected to juice inflation, for obvious reasons. Research houses have been raising their CPI and PCE estimates left and right over the past few days. But if inflation gets out of control, the Federal Reserve would swoop in and hike rates to try to quell rising prices like it has in the past, right? And if so, wouldn’t that keep bonds grounded? Possibly. But between federal-government purges and the potential for a lot of short-term tariff pain here at home, unemployment estimates are also going up. And while higher joblessness would weigh on inflation somewhat, it could also stay the Fed’s hand and put downward pressure on long-term rates. In short: Stagflation (high inflation + slow economic growth) is actually a win-win situation for TIPS, and thus a win-win for WIW. And we can expect to get more out of WIW than a plain-vanilla ETF in a TIPS-friendly environment. That’s largely because of 30% debt leverage, which is an elevated amount that lets management go full-throttle on its highest-conviction picks. That same leverage is how WIW gets 9% monthly dividends out of such highly rated holdings. Western Asset’s fund trades at an 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV), so we’re getting its holdings for 89 cents on the dollar. That’s good—it would be great, but WIW has averaged a 12% discount over the past five years. Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (JPC)Distribution Rate: 10.7% Few debt CEFs will get anywhere close to WIW’s portfolio quality, but we shouldn’t look down our noses at Nuveen Preferred & Income Opportunities Fund (JPC), which also manages to squeeze a stellar yield out of a sterling portfolio. As the name would suggest, Nuveen’s CEF is a preferred-stock fund. Preferreds technically aren’t debt, but they share a lot of the same characteristics. So they’re bond proxies, and they too can thrive should we get lower long-term rates. JPC specifically holds roughly 280 preferreds with a heavy overseas bent—currently, the portfolio is split 55/45 domestic/international. But the companies behind the preferreds are exactly what we’d expect from a preferred fund: Financial firms such as Barclays (BCS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) make up the lion’s share of assets. Credit quality is also much better than other funds in JPC’s category. With JPC, we’re getting both the benefit of human managers (who can target underpriced opportunities) and an even loftier amount of leverage, at 39%. The result is, like WIW, a juiced-up version of a plain-vanilla index ETF: JPC Returns Ycharts But look at that nasty dip at the far right. That’s worse than a lot of bond funds, in part because preferred stocks—while “preferred” compared to common equity—aren’t as secure as true debt. Extreme fright in the equity markets can weigh on preferreds, too, which makes timing all the more important. Right now, JPC is trading at a roughly 2% discount to NAV versus a five-year average of 5%. We’re getting a bargain on this double-digit monthly dividend, and we could be suffering additional short-term headaches, too. BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ)Distribution Rate: 10.1% I highlighted a BlackRock muni fund a few days ago, but it’s not the only BlackRock product that’s worth a look in this environment. The BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ) is a multisector bond fund whose managers have a true “go anywhere” mentality. Right now, shares of BTZ give us exposure to investment-grade corporates (40%), junk (35%), developed sovereigns (17%), securitized products (11%), small amounts of bank loans and emerging-market debt, even a trace of equity. The sizable chunk of high-yield debt means credit isn’t stellar—in fact, on average (BBB-), it’s about a step lower than the average multisector bond fund’s credit (BBB). We get the same combination of opportunistic management and high (35%) leverage as we do with the other funds. The downswings are still violent, but the outperformance is massive. In other words, while we still want to buy at ideal prices, the pressure isn’t as great for us to jump into BTZ at exactly the right moment. A 8% discount to NAV versus a 6% five-year average is nothing to sneeze at. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Best Crypto Presales for 2025: Where Big Money and Big Politics Meet

In 2025’s first quarter, we’ve seen a big shift in crypto’s power dynamics. It’s not just about cool tech or chasing quick profits anymore. Now, it’s also about power – political power and Wall Street money. At the same time, financial giants like BlackRock say their big-picture investment trends – or ‘mega trends’ – still include crypto. It’s clear: politics and big finance are getting seriously involved. And that changes the game. Some new altcoins are stepping up, perfectly positioned to ride this wave of influence and money. Here are three of the best crypto presales right now that could take off as institutions and politicians pour into the space: Crypto’s no longer hanging out on the fringes – it’s being invited into the halls of power. The Trump family is stepping deeper into crypto in 2025. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have launched American Bitcoin with mining firm Hut 8, aiming to build a major U.S. Bitcoin reserve. At the same time, they’re backing a stablecoin called USD1 through World Liberty Financial – a dollar-pegged token designed for global payments. With moves in both mining and stablecoins, the Trumps are shifting from crypto supporters to key players in its next institutional chapter. Meanwhile, over on Wall Street, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink says the same ‘mega trends’ that drove massive institutional interest in crypto are still going strong – even as the U.S. economy reorients itself. The message? Big money and big politics are all in. And for everyday investors watching from the sidelines, a few new crypto projects are already gearing up to ride this wave. Bitcoin is gunning for $1M, and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is riding shotgun. This meme-powered, community-driven token is built for one mission: help regular folks catch a piece of Bitcoin’s rocket ride – with a little extra kick. It’s priced at just $0.00246 and has already raised over $4.6M in presale. But what really sets it apart? Real Bitcoin rewards. That’s right – $BTCBULL is the only meme coin that automatically pays holders actual $BTC every time Bitcoin smashes through a major price milestone like $150K, $200K. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more $BTC and $BTCBULL you can earn. And with each new milestone, part of the $BTCBULL supply gets burned, making your tokens more scarce and potentially more valuable. It also integrates with Best Wallet, so you can skip the headache of setting up complicated Bitcoin wallets. Just hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet, and get rewarded. In a world where most meme coins are all bark and no bite, $BTCBULL is bringing real rewards to the table – and it’s doing it with style, memes, and a whole lot of bullish energy. As crypto goes institutional – with politicians launching mining ops and Wall Street chasing “mega trends” – retail users need better tools to stay ahead. That’s where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) steps in. It’s more than just a presale play – it’s a utility token designed to keep you in the driver’s seat as crypto evolves. Priced at $0.0247, with over $11.6M raised in presale, $BEST is powering the rapid growth of Best Wallet – a next-gen crypto wallet that’s taking direct aim at outdated players like MetaMask. When you buy $BEST, you get real-world perks: reduced transaction fees, early access to new token launches, boosted staking rewards, and even exclusive bonuses through iGaming partners, including free spins and loot boxes. With over 60K followers on X, 50% monthly user growth, and ambitions to claim 40% of the wallet market by 2026, $BEST is gunning for top spot among utility tokens. In a world where big players are taking over, $BEST is your front-row seat – and your power-up – in crypto’s next great shift. In a crypto world split across dozens of blockchains, Qubetics ($TICS) is building the bridges – and then some. Currently priced at $0.1573, Qubetics has already raised over $16M in presale with 24,6K backers already on board. But this isn’t just another multichain protocol. Qubetics combines DeFi tools, a built-in multichain wallet, and even a decentralized VPN (dVPN) to keep users’ activity private and secure – a rare combo in today’s market. Plus, Qubetics AI agent enhances everything from transaction routing to yield optimization, making the platform smarter as it grows. In a year where institutions and regulators are tightening the screws, $TICS gives users a futureproof way to stay connected without getting boxed in. As the crypto space continues to intertwine with political and institutional spheres, tokens like $BTCBULL, $BEST, and $TICS stand out for their strategic positioning and innovative solutions. Investors seeking to navigate this new era of crypto would do well to consider these projects, each offering unique avenues to engage with the market’s evolving dynamics.​ Don’t forget to DYOR (do your own research) before investing, as this article is for informational purposes only and doesn’t constitute financial advice.

The Federal Reserve, which stepped in to calm markets during the Covid panic, is closely watching the $29 trillion Treasury market for signs convulsions caused by Trump’s tariffs could turn into a full-blown financial crisis (while Wall Street braces for a looming “existential” threat).

More trade war, tanking stock markets and sending the bitcoin price and crypto markets on a rollercoaster. “We have had to deploy quite quickly, various tools,” Susan Collins, head of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times, referring to previous times the Fed has moved to calm chaotic markets at times of low liquidity or market malfunctions. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” However, Collins, who fears Trump’s tariff trade war could send inflation back above 3% in 2025, said that currently “markets are continuing to function well” and that “we’re not seeing liquidity concerns overall," adding the Fed “does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise.” 04/14 update: JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced to step in and bail out the near-$30 trillion U.S. Treasury market following U.S. president Donald Trump’s campaign of rapid-fire global tariffs. “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations,” Dimon said in a Friday earnings call, warning that the Fed won’t act until “they start to panic a little bit." Dimon suggested the Fed could ditch a rule that exempts Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, something that would allow institutional investors to buy more bonds without breaking capital requirement rules. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The suggestion has been seized on as bullish by Bitmex cofounder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes, who posted to X that: “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.” "[Supplementary leverage ratio] exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital," Hayes added. Earlier this month, traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars—though Collins said emergency rate cuts would not be the Fed’s primary tool for responding to market’s failing. In 2020, ahead of one of the largest ever stock market rallies that saw the bitcoin price and crypto market surge to never-before-seen heights, the Fed restarted its 2008 financial crisis-era programs of quantitative easing while cutting rates to near-zero and scrapping its cap on the number of Treasuries it could buy—fueling expectations the Fed could again turbo charge the bitcoin price. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. Collins’ comments come as the New York Fed’s John Williams has warned that Trump’s tariffs could send inflation spiralling, caused a wave of unemployment and damage U.S. economic growth. This coming week, Fed chair Jerome Powell, who is at loggerheads with Trump over the need for interest rate cuts, is due to speak at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday in what will be a closely-watched speech.

More Trump's inauguration as global markets convulse over Trump's trade tariffs. Trump’s fast-moving approach to tariffs and trade negotiation—that’s seen China hit with levies of almost 150% before a carve out was announced for smartphones, computers and some other electronics—has seen the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jump 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% over the past week, spooking markets with its outsized swings. Crypto and stock markets have been on a rollercoaster that’s caused some of the most extreme volatility ever seen. After Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs, the S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever following a steep multi-trillion dollar sell-off. The notoriously volatile bitcoin price and crypto market has swung from highs of $3 trillion late March to lows of $2.5 trillion in early April before rebounding back toward $3 trillion. Meanwhile, business leaders on Wall Street and across the U.S. are warning the economy is buckling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned the U.S. may already be in a recession due to Trump’s sweeping tariffs while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon has said recession is the “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade war.

The CEO of the largest asset manager on Earth says that despite the current market volatility and uncertainty, the “mega trends” driving the financial world are still intact. In a new discussion on CNBC, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that the big trends like artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and other cutting edge technology plays are still valid. However, Fink says that some of those plays may be delayed or changed slightly due to President Trump’s tariffs and the likelihood of a recession. “I do believe that the mega trends are still with us, whether it’s AI, data centers, infrastructure, the whole reorientation of our economy. So I think the mega force trends are not going to change by what has happened. But maybe the execution of some of these trends may be delayed or may be pushed out longer, but I still remain to be optimistic over the long run. Yes, we have to recalibrate, [and] I do believe we’re probably starting, or if not, in a recession. Yes, I think the market is still underestimating how high inflation can get, as you factor in all the tariffs, you factor in all these other issues, it’s going to be quite additive. I read in a report that if you just take the tariffs in the cost of home building, the average new home could be up as much as 26%. We already have a housing affordability problem… This is not a pandemic, this is not a financial crisis, this is something that we’ve created… The United States in post-World War II was a global stabilizer.

Markets have been on a rollercoaster ever since President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day,” unleashing a blur of tariff impositions, reversals, reimpositions, retaliatory blows, and exemptions. For the week ending April 11, U.S. indexes swung wildly — but ended up clawing back some of the ground lost earlier. The S&P 500 closed the week up 8.2%, while the Dow flirted with record territory but ended with a more modest 6% gain. The Nasdaq, powered by dip-buying in bruised Big Tech names, finished roughly 12% above its Monday lows. On Friday, first-quarter bank earnings arrived with a dose of realism: JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.37%), BlackRock (BLK+2.04%), and Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%) all posted strong results but struck a cautious tone on the economic outlook. At the same time, consumer sentiment slumped to its lowest level since 2022. The safe-haven scramble also continued. Gold soared to a record $3,254.90 per ounce on Friday, and the 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 4.57% — its biggest weekly jump in decades. Analysts cited growing unease over policy volatility, while The Wall Street Journal noted mounting hedging activity and foreign investors shifting away from U.S. debt. Now comes another high-stakes week, with major companies across finance, healthcare, media, and logistics set to report results. Earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS+2.42%), Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ+1.76%), UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%), CSX (CSX+1.23%), and Kinder Morgan (KMI+1.70%) will offer a fresh read on everything from M&A to supply chains and consumers’ streaming preferences. Here’s what to watch this week. Goldman Sachs kicks off the week. Investors will be watching its earnings for updates on deal pipelines, market volatility, and risk appetite. Tuesday brings a wave of key reports that cut across sectors. Bank of America (BAC+2.46%) and Citigroup (C+3.39%) will offer fresh perspective on lending conditions, consumer credit health, and trading activity. United Airlines (UAL+0.27%), meanwhile, is expected to provide a read on travel demand and cost pressures. The March Import and Export Price Indexes will also drop, offering clues on tariff effects and supply chain inflation. Abbott Labs (ABT+0.90%), U.S. Bancorp (USB+1.35%), Kinder Morgan, and CSX headline. Together, they’ll offer signals on healthcare demand, regional banking pressures, infrastructure activity, and the state of freight and transport networks. The March retail sales report — due that morning — could move markets with a read on household spending. Thursday brings a mix of corporate and economic data with the potential to move markets. Investors will look to UnitedHealth Group for signals on healthcare costs, while Netflix earnings will shed light on global streaming demand and subscriber trends amid economic uncertainty. American Express (AXP+1.95%) results will offer a read on consumer and business spending, particularly among higher-income households. Meanwhile, the weekly initial jobless claims report for the period ending April 12 will provide a timely check on labor market stability. U.S. financial markets are closed for Good Friday.

The U.S. aims to counter China's growing presence near the Panama Canal through military and economic partnerships, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowing to "take back" control of the strategic waterway. While China does not operate the canal, its control over nearby ports raises espionage fears. The U.S. has deployed Navy and Coast Guard assets for joint exercises with Panama, marking heightened military cooperation. Panama asserts sovereignty over the canal but has made concessions to the U.S., including withdrawing from China's Belt and Road Initiative. A U.S.-led consortium may acquire Chinese-leased ports, a move praised by Trump. China dismisses U.S. claims as sensationalistic, citing historical U.S. interference (1989 invasion) and emphasizing its commercial, not operational, role in Panama. Experts dispute claims of Chinese meddling. The canal is vital for global trade and military logistics, with the U.S. fearing Chinese intelligence exploitation. Panama remains neutral but caught in superpower competition, with tensions unlikely to ease. While China does not operate the canal, its control over nearby ports raises espionage fears.

Panama remains neutral but caught in superpower competition, with tensions unlikely to ease. The U.S. has escalated efforts to counter China's growing influence over the Panama Canal, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promising that Washington will "take back" control of the strategic waterway through strengthened military and economic partnerships with Panama City. The secretary made the announcement during the inauguration of a U.S.-funded naval dock in Panama's capital Tuesday, April 8. It follows repeated warnings from former President Donald Trump about Beijing's alleged encroachment on canal operations. The canal sees over 40 percent of U.S. container traffic, worth $270 billion annually. Given its status as a linchpin of global trade, ensuring its security is a top priority for Washington. The U.S. completed construction of the Panama Canal in 1914 and handed it over to Panama in 1999. Hegseth emphasized that while China does not operate the canal, its control over nearby infrastructure â such as ports leased by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison â raises espionage and security concerns. "China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area," Hegseth said. "That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama." Panama Canal: More than just a trade route In recent weeks, the U.S. has deployed Navy vessels, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft to Panama for joint exercises, marking the most significant military cooperation between the two nations in decades. The guided-missile cruisers USS Chosin and USS Normandy, along with the USCGC Kimball, are among the assets now operating near the canal. Hegseth framed the deployments as "bold first steps" to reinforce Panama's sovereignty, though Panamanian officials insist the canal remains firmly under their control. Meanwhile, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino has pushed back against Trump's claims of Chinese control, calling the canal part of Panama's "inalienable patrimony." Yet Mulino has made concessions to Washington, including withdrawing from China's Belt and Road Initiative in February. A recent audit also flagged irregularities in CK Hutchison's port leases, paving the way for their sale to a U.S.-led consortium including BlackRock â a move Trump hailed as "reclaiming" the canal. (Related: BlackRock secures control of Panama Canal ports, curtailing Chinese influence.) China's embassy in Panama dismissed U.S. allegations as "sensationalistic," noting that the only disruption to the canal's operations came during the 1989 U.S. invasion. The embassy even asked: "Who is truly safeguarding the canal's neutrality?" The canal's strategic value has surged amid the U.S.-China rivalry, with planners at the Department of Defense viewing it as vital for moving warships during potential Pacific conflicts. While Panama maintains neutrality, Washington fears Beijing could exploit commercial ties for intelligence gathering â a concern amplified by China's global infrastructure ambitions.

Title: NYC Comptroller Pursues Lawsuit Against Tesla and Musk for Stock Plunge

Thoughts on the Middle East, History and Religion © 2025 Informed Comment Inequality.org 04/13/2025 By Natalia Renta | – ( Inequality.org ) – In the wake of recent Tesla Takedown protests at hundreds of dealerships across the country, financial officers on both sides of the political aisle weighed in on how to address Tesla’s tanking share price. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called for accountability from Elon Musk and Tesla’s board of directors, while 26 Republican state financial officers seemingly sought to blame and intimidate the many concerned citizens exercising their First Amendment rights. Musk’s attempts to slash government agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, through DOGE has triggered public outrage. Countless people have shown up with witty signs at hundreds of Tesla dealerships to peacefully express their displeasure at an unelected billionaire exercising unlawful power across the federal government. The reputational damage Musk has inflicted on Tesla through his destructive, undemocratic actions has resulted in plummeting car sales and Tesla shares losing nearly 40 percent of their value in less than three months. State financial officers, as stewards of public pension funds, weighed in on this controversy. Pension funds hold many types of investments, including in index funds that are invested across the stock market — including in Tesla shares. Comptroller Lander has called on the New York City Law Department to pursue litigation against Tesla on behalf of the city’s pensions. He pointed out that Musk has been spending his time as the head of DOGE promoting policies harmful to Tesla instead of serving as the full-time CEO of the company and that the board of directors has repeatedly failed to provide independent oversight. Musk seems to be spending all his time on the DOGE effort, sleeping in the Eisenhower Office Building and clocking 120-hour weeks, apparently contradicting company statements about him spending significant time with Tesla. Photo by Craig Adderley: https://www.pexels.com/photo/cars-parked-in-front-of-company-building-2449452/ This is not the first time Lander has expressed concerns about Tesla’s governance. Just last year, he called on Tesla shareholders to vote against Musk’s outrageous pay package and the renomination of two board members, including Musk’s brother. State financial officers on the other side of the aisle took a different approach: placing the blame for Tesla’s predicament on citizens exercising their First Amendment rights instead of on Musk’s actions. In a chilling letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the officers seemingly attempt to conflate isolated incidents of vandalism with the widespread, peaceful protests that explicitly “oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property” — all in the name of “public school teachers, first responders, and police officers” invested in Tesla. They commend the administration’s creation of an FBI taskforce to go after “domestic terrorists” targeting Tesla and call on elected officials to use that incendiary terminology. Attorney General Bondi herself has also seemingly encouraged the conflation of unlawful vandalism with peaceful protests, saying: “If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you.” This approach is extremely dangerous: it threatens our rights in an attempt to protect unelected billionaires wreaking havoc. If state financial officers truly care about the workers whose money they steward, they should follow the lead of Lander and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. The union leader has just called on BlackRock and other large asset managers — some of Tesla’s largest shareholders and managers of many pensioners’ money — and 75 state and city chief fiduciary officers who oversee most major public pensions to take steps to protect pension beneficiaries from Tesla’s plummeting share price. Musk and Tesla’s board need to be held accountable — not everyday citizens peacefully expressing their views.

Title: Ireland blown away in second half by ruthless England
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/12/ireland-blown-away-in-second-half-by-ruthless-england/

The dam burst shortly after half-time and for 40 minutes Ireland were tossed on wave upon tide of England attacks. Their resistance was unflinching and fruitless. The overbearing context was the 78-point hammering in Twickenham a year ago, and by that blunt metric Ireland’s improvement was obvious and significant. But in a World Cup year, they cannot afford to take comfort in a 44-point beating. Ireland trailed by just two points at the break, having squared up to England without deference. They scored first and nearly scored again while England were stuck on zero. Apart from the scrum, Ireland’s fundamentals were good, and many of England’s errors were forced. At half-time it felt like a contest between peers. That was unsustainable. It was over 10 minutes after the restart. After a sixth scrum penalty was called against Ireland, Niamh O’Dowd was sent to the sin-bin, and while Ireland were reduced to 14 players England ran in two tries. In the second half Ireland didn’t make their first entry into England’s 22 until two minutes from the end and by then they had been bombarded and battered. The unblinking courage of Ireland’s tackling was astonishing, but England’s power was overwhelming. “Initially, it’s disappointing to see a game go away from you in the second half,” said Scott Bemand, the Ireland coach. “As we pick through the bones of it, there were questions asked of an English team that have not been asked of them recently. We got them under pressure. They’ve had to go back to the dressing-room and rediscover how they play the game because we had them under pressure. “It’s a step forward from where we were a year ago, but there’s more to come. I said to the players at the end, this isn’t the end of the Six Nations. There are two massive games to come.” In the first half England had no rhythm behind the scrum; the tempo, though, changed dramatically after the break. Once they got the ball to the edges, they repeatedly generated overlaps. Ireland’s scramble defence was valiant and just after half-time Amee-Leigh Costigan denied Jess Breach with a flying tackle less than a yard from the try line. The pressure, though, was relentless. By the end England had run in seven tries, six of them in the second half. It is rare for a tight head prop to be named player of the match, and rarer still in a game that contained 54 points, but it was significant that the award was given to Maud Muir. Ireland’s scrum was a straw house from the start and ultimately it collapsed. Their lineout went the same way. In the first half Ireland lost just one lineout on their own throw, but in the third quarter they lost four, and England’s third try came directly from one of those turnovers. The huge crowd of 7,754 – a record for a home fixture - never deserted them. With 10 minutes to go there was another heartfelt rendition of The Fields of Athenry, and half an hour after the final whistle Irish players were still signing posters and posing for selfies. At half-time Ireland left the field to a standing ovation. A year ago, there were 38 points between the teams at the break, but, until then, everything about this game had been different. Ireland were smart and bolshie and refused to bow to the best team in the world. England were forced to wait 35 minutes for their first score, and for most of that time Ireland were able to absorb whatever pressure the visitors could muster. Ireland, though, weren’t camped in the last ditch. They were terrific at the breakdown, spiking England’s momentum with a handful of turnovers, and Dannah O’Brien managed territory with a series of fine kicks. Ireland’s driving maul had produced three tries against France, and it nearly produced another after just 10 minutes. England were marched back 15 metres towards their own line and only barely kept Ireland out. Ireland’s breakthrough came soon afterwards. They gathered the ball on the ground at the back of a messy line-out, O’Brien played a terrific kick into space behind the Abby Bow, and Costigan exploded past her opposite number to touch down in the corner. Ireland held the lead for just 10 minutes. Morwenna Talling touched down after a lineout maul, the excellent Zoe Harrison landed the conversion and England led 7-5 lead at the break. After that, the second half was nothing like the first. Scoring Sequence: 25 mins Costigan try, 5-0; 35 mins Talling try, Harrison con, 5-7; Harrison try and con, 5-14; Jones try, Harrison con, 5-21; Bern try, Harrison con, 5-28; Bern try, Harrison con, 5-35; Kildunne try, Harrison con, 5-42; Ford try, Aitchinson con, 5-49 IRELAND: S Flood (Railway Union); A McGann (Railway Union), A Dalton (Old Belvedere), E Higgins (Railway Union); A-L Costigan Railway Union, capt); D O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), E Lane (Blackrock College); N O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), N Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), L Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); F Tuite (Old Belvedere), D Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster); B Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster), E King (Old Belvedere), A Wafer (Blackrock College/Leinster).

Title: Bitcoin Outlook: Key Levels You Need to Watch Amid Economic Uncertainty

The optimism that swept through the crypto space following President Donald Trump's election win has quickly collided with market reality. Once hailed as a champion of digital assets—vowing to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet”—Trump's recent rollout of broad global tariffs has shaken investor confidence, sending shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets. Bitcoin, which surged to a record high of nearly $110,000 during the inauguration hype in January, has since retraced sharply, dropping over 10% to fall below the $78,000 mark. Don't Miss: Often viewed as both a hedge against traditional finance and a speculative asset sensitive to liquidity flows, BTC now sits at a critical juncture. The charts are beginning to reflect the tension, with key technical levels taking shape that could dictate the next major move. In this piece, we'll break down the most important areas to watch on the Bitcoin chart and what they might tell us in the days and weeks ahead. Monthly Chart Zooming out is always important, as it provides a clearer picture of the overall direction of a market by reducing short-term noise. From the lows of November 2022 to the highs reached in January, Bitcoin surged by an impressive 611%. Source: TradingView (User & Screenshot – NoticeTrades) Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. What's important on the monthly chart is the current structure that has been forming since the 2022 bottom. The market has consistently maintained a higher low trend relative to previous swing lows. Bitcoin is currently trading at $80,200 as of Tuesday, which is a crucial level to hold. This level represents the 50% retracement of $79,500 from the previous swing low to the all-time high. It serves as a natural support level where, as an investor or trader, you'd want to see demand. Weekly Chart Zooming in a little closer to the weekly timeframe, we can see more detail regarding the structure that formed the monthly swings. As of the current price action, BTC is holding well above the 50 EMA, which aligns with the 50% retracement level of the overall trading range. Source: TradingView (User & Screenshot – NoticeTrades) Areas to watch on the weekly chart include the 50 EMA and the strength around the current swing. For any continuation in the short to mid-term, price would need to form a higher low here. If the price starts falling below the 50 EMA and continues the overall daily trend, which I will discuss in the next section, we can expect a move down towards the November low. If the price starts falling below the 50 EMA and continues the overall daily trend, which I will discuss in the next section, we can expect a move down towards the November low. See Also: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Daily Chart Since mid-January, Bitcoin has been in a bearish market—characterized by the market attacking lows and leaving behind protected highs, which are lower highs. On Sunday, Bitcoin made a run toward the swing low around $76,500 but failed to close below it, which could be a potential sign of strength or demand. Source: TradingView (User & Screenshot – NoticeTrades) What is key to watch here on the daily chart? Since the trend is still bearish, the first detail to look for is a break above a lower high to indicate a potential shift in trend. That level is currently at $88,000. You would want to see price move above the range highs and not reject, as the market did during the inauguration. The potential bull case still stands in my view as long as Bitcoin continues to show relative strength above the Election/November low. However, as mentioned, if the price breaks below the 50 EMA on the weekly, I'd expect that to be the next downside target before any sort of high-time-frame bounce. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: Trump Tariffs Provide Limited Strategic Opportunity to Buy Bitcoin

The much-dreaded Trump tariffs are here, with the new US President enforcing up to 50% additional duties on imported goods from friends and foes alike. Top markets reported heavy losses with the S&P 500 falling close to 5%, Dow Jones 4%, and Nasdaq suffering a 6% decline. However, premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin has resisted the recent downward price pressure and has remained steadfast above $81k. Trump styled the aggressive April 3 move as “Liberation Day” for the USA, but it could result in a massive trade war worldwide, leading to another major economic recession. Affected entities, including America’s allies like Canada, the European Union, and others, have already announced retaliatory measures, and adversaries like China have followed suit. Bitcoin remains the only major asset that has held onto its price levels going into the weekend. The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization initially fell 5% to nearly $81k. Still, it has since recovered some of these losses and is sitting relatively comfortably at $84k, reversing the downward trend entirely. Bitcoin’s recent price stability in the face of a major American-initiated trade war offers insight into the future of global economics. The primary reason Bitcoin is showing incredible resilience is the US Dollar’s threatened status as the global reserve currency. The US’s financial burden is breaking new records at a rapid pace. The national debt has crossed $33 trillion, and for the first time in the country’s history, interest payments on this gigantic figure will exceed the national defense budget of $950 billion. Within the next six years, the interest on debt will likely surpass all US government tax collections and other sources of revenue. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of major investment bank BlackRock: “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control… America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Previously, Bitcoin promoters used the same logic, but here, we have the CEO of the largest bank in the world actually using it in his communique with the investors. This shows that BTC has come a long way in recent years. The stable performance of the top digital coin has resulted in investors looking at the cryptocurrency with renewed enthusiasm, not as a speculative asset but a long-term store of value similar to Gold. According to leading financial author and commentator Morgen Rochard: “Bitcoin isn’t a stock pick. It’s an opt-out button.” As Bitcoin continues to offer a much more stable alternative to the uneasiness of the global markets under the cusp of a trade war, it will continue to prove its worth as a serious investment tool.

Title: Bitcoin’s Impact Alarming, Says NY Atty. General—Congress Needs To Act

New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a warning to US congressional leaders regarding regulation of cryptocurrency, particularly how Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could erode the US dollar’s position around the world. She urged stronger federal regulations to protect investors from fraud and criminal use in the cryptocurrency market. James emphasized the importance of a federal regulatory system for digital currencies in her Congressional letter. She identified that lacking regulation, these type of currencies expose users to fraud and monetary volatility. Bitcoin currently presents an actual threat to the dominance of the dollar, particularly since more businesses and individuals opt for digital currencies when sending money overseas, James indicated. Her concerns echo those of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against the dollar amid US fiscal challenges and rising inflation. “Millions of New Yorkers actively buy, sell or hold cryptocurrency and other digital assets, and they deserve further protection,” James wrote in her message. 🚨NEW: This morning @NewYorkStateAG Letitia James sent a letter to congressional leaders @LeaderJohnThune, @SenSchumer, @SpeakerJohnson and @RepJeffries urging them to pass a federal regulatory framework for digital assets to mitigate fraud, criminal activity, and financial… pic.twitter.com/yJjDgBqdBt — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 10, 2025 The Attorney General placed particular emphasis on stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets such as the US dollar. She called on lawmakers to establish regulations mandating that stablecoin issuers have a US presence and support their tokens with US dollars or treasuries. James described how stablecoins facilitate the exchange of value among various cryptocurrencies but, in the absence of regulation, can be manipulated and create fraud. She also demanded greater protections from crypto scams that have resulted in tremendous financial losses. “Thousands of New Yorkers and investors nationwide have lost millions of dollars to cryptocurrency scams and fraud that can be avoided with more robust federal regulations,” James said. James actually cautioned against having digital assets in retirement accounts like IRAs. She contended that cryptocurrencies are too volatile and risky for retirement savings plans, citing the extreme price fluctuations of Bitcoin as proof of instability capable of injuring the financial well-being of individuals, especially retirees relying on savings. This is because financial institutions like Fidelity began offering crypto IRA options to clients. In addition to investor protection, James also contended that thorough crypto regulations would enhance national security. She explained that cryptocurrency purchases are usually anonymous and used for criminal activities, thus necessitating the government to implement stringent rules mandating crypto firms to register with regulators and adhere to anti-money laundering protocols.

Morning Rundown: Harvard’s funding freeze, El Salvador won’t return mistakenly deported man, and Pride sponsors pull back Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Government bonds have been selling off while stocks have plunged. That’s unusual, and it’s raising concerns that global investors are losing some of their long-standing confidence in America. Stocks are generally seen as a risky type of asset, while bonds are known as a “safe haven,” with the two typically moving in opposite directions. That’s because government bonds — a type of security sold to help finance expenditures, to be paid back to buyers with interest over a set period — are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The same can’t be said for publicly traded companies and their share prices. So when stock markets are booming and investors are excited to bet on the performance of American businesses, demand for lower-risk bonds dries up. During times of turbulence, the reverse usually happens. We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much. Barclays Analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha Instead, the two markets have seen simultaneous sell-offs. The premier U.S. government bond, the 10-year Treasury note, saw its yield surge above 4.5% this week. Bond prices and yields are inversely correlated, so rising yields signal lower appetite for the bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield ended the week more than 12% higher, while the S&P 500 closed out a week of volatile trading up 5.7%, rebounding late Friday after a series of brutal losses. “We don’t know exactly why bonds are gyrating so much,” Barclays analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha said in a note to clients Friday that he titled “This is not normal.” Soaring yields on 10- and 30-year Treasurys make it costlier for the federal government to borrow money. It’s also bad news for consumers because the 10-year note’s yield is directly linked to rates for mortgages, credit cards and personal and business loans. “This matters to nearly all Americans,” said Natalie Colley, a partner and financial planner at the New York-based firm Francis Financial. “Gone are the days of a pension,” she said, referring to the more than 70 million U.S. savers with access to 401(k) retirement accounts tied to markets. Volatility on Wall Street has unnerved many account holders in recent weeks, forcing some financial planners to do double duty as therapists to rattled clients. “If Treasurys are not a safe-haven asset, that has major implications for balance sheets across the board — businesses, nonprofits, pensions, households,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a former top economist in the Biden administration who’s now the director of economics at Yale University’s Budget Lab. “So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe.” He called recent bond market trends “the most concerning piece of data since the tariffs began.” “It’s showing a deterioration in confidence in the U.S.’s place in the world,” he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has pushed back against such concerns, telling Fox Business on Wednesday, “There is nothing systemic about this. I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that’s going on in the bond market.” But experts see warning signs elsewhere, too. The value of the dollar relative to other global currencies has nosedived. This week it suffered its biggest drop since 2022 and ended Friday at its lowest level since September. “Everything in the U.S. is not doing well right now,” Kyla Scanlon, a financial educator and author of “In This Economy?: How Money and Markets Really Work,” told her TikTok followers this week. “The U.S. dollar is getting crushed.” She chalked up the currency’s decline to “the erratic trade policy that we’ve seen,” adding: “Markets don’t believe that the U.S. has a stable or clear economic plan.” Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, flagged similar concerns. “Normally when you see big tariff increases, I would have expected the dollar to go up. The fact that the dollar is going down at the same time I think lends some more credibility to the story of investor preferences shifting,” he told CNBC on Friday. There are several other possible explanations. One has to do with the way hedge funds bet on bond markets. Another could be that investors are anticipating a run-up in inflation and demanding higher interest rates now so they don’t lose money in the future. “Maybe they feel, or the market feels, that the actions around tariffs are actually going to create upward inflationary pressure,” said Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, an advisory firm in New York. “That very well could be part of the puzzle here.” Even experts who are more hesitant to assign a cause to the bond sell-off say geopolitical factors are hard to ignore. So much of world finance is predicated on U.S. Treasurys being safe. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics, yale budget lab “The idea of other countries turning away from America, I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole necessarily,” said Lee Baker, founder of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta. “But in this particular instance, America turned away from everybody else” with steep new trade barriers. For now, Baker and other wealth advisers are cautioning clients not to react hastily to the recent volatility. Younger investors who aren’t close to retirement — and typically have less exposure to the bond market — should stay the course, Colley said. “Making sure that you’re in an appropriate asset allocation for your stage in life” and building up some emergency savings can help create a “financial moat that will insulate any investor at any point in their investing career from feeling panic around what’s going on in the stock market,” she said. If possible, she recommends keeping at least six months’ of cash on hand for a rainy day. Older retirement savers can consider some protective measures, Baker said. His firm has been building buffer exchange-traded funds — so-called “defined-outcome” ETFs tied to options contracts — into clients’ portfolios. These funds tend to be more expensive and typically cap potential gains, but they offer robust downside protections and have seen a recent surge in interest. BlackRock launched a new iShares buffer ETF earlier this year, billing it as a way of “mitigating risk while participating in market growth.” Baker added that “there’s a whole lot of other stuff in the world beyond stocks and bonds” to consider investing in, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equity. But he cautioned that it’s usually a good idea to consult a qualified adviser first, partly to avoid making important money moves out of fear. “It’s probably not a good idea to go whole hog in any of these,” he said, “but we can certainly reduce your downside while giving you some upside with a combination of these things.” J.J.

Title: US Treasuries suddenly trading like risky assets

Billed on Wall Street as so rock-solid safe that they are risk-free, US Treasury bonds have long served as first port of call for investors during times of panic. They rallied during the global financial crisis, on 9/11 and even when America’s own credit rating was cut. But now, as President Donald Trump unleashes an all-out assault on global trade, their status as the world’s safe haven is increasingly coming into question. Yields, especially on longer-term debt, have surged in recent days while the dollar has plunged. Even more disconcerting is the pattern of the recent market moves. Investors have often dumped 10- and 30-year Treasuries — pushing prices down and yields up — at the very same time they frantically sold stocks, crypto and other risky assets. The inverse is also true, with Treasuries rising in unison with them. They are trading, in other words, a little like a risky asset themselves. Or, as former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says, like the debt of an emerging-market country. Even if this dynamic was to fade as swings in stocks eventually normalise, as most analysts expect, a message has been delivered to policymakers in Washington: Investor confidence in US bonds can no longer be taken for granted — not after a years-long borrowing binge that swelled its debt load and not with a president in the White House hell-bent on rewriting the rules at home and abroad and antagonising, in the process, many of the country’s biggest creditors. This has profound implications for the global financial system. As the world’s “risk-free” asset, Treasuries are used as a benchmark to determine the price of everything from stocks to sovereign bonds to mortgage rates, while serving as collateral for trillions of dollars of lending a day. Treasuries and the dollar get their strength from “the world’s perception of the competence of American fiscal and monetary management and the solidity of American political and financial institutions,” said Jim Grant, the founder of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, a widely followed financial newsletter. “Possibly, the world is reconsidering.” Friday was more evidence of the same. As US stocks opened the session lower, 30-year yields were surging, touching as high as 4.99%. As shares advanced into the afternoon session, long bonds rallied in tandem. “Treasuries are not behaving as a safe haven,” said ING rates strategist Padhraic Garvey. “If we were to slip into recession there is a path there for yields to revert lower. But the here and now is painting Treasuries as a tainted product, and that’s not comfortable territory. Treasuries have proved to be a pain trade too.” “Treasuries are losing their haven status. Capital is leaving the US at an increasing rate as the dollar’s reserve-currency standing is diminished, and the risk of a recession raises the likelihood of an inflation-stoking a double-digit fiscal deficit,” said Simon White, a macro strategist with Bloomberg. But not everyone is convinced that investors are losing faith in the safety of US government debt. Benson Durham, head of global asset allocation at Piper Sandler and a former Federal Reserve economist, has done his own analysis comparing key Treasury-market metrics to those in Europe. Some measures suggest investors have demanded less of a premium to own US debt relative to German and UK bonds in recent days, he said. “People are right to kind of worry about this general economic management,” Durham said. But “it’s not clear to me, at least not yet, that this is an episode where people are particularly penalising US assets.” (Story continues below) Traders work on the floor of the American Stock Exchange at the New York Stock Exchange headquarters on April 11. (Photo: Bloomberg) There are suggestions in markets, albeit lacking the hard evidence to back them up, that Treasuries may have fallen because China is selling or shunning them. Some debate whether Beijing might eventually dump US debt as a response to the US tariffs. Others say more technical factors are behind the selloff in the long-end. There are signs that hedge funds have been unwinding leveraged trades that capitalise on price differences between Treasuries and interest-rate swaps or futures contracts. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed that view in an appearance on Fox Business earlier this week. “I believe that there is nothing systemic about this — I think that it is an uncomfortable but normal deleveraging that’s going on in the bond market,” said Bessent, who on taking office advertised lower 10-year borrowing costs as an ambition. An auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday also saw investors snap up $22 billion worth of the debt, supporting the argument that Treasuries continue to be attractive even during the selloff. That’s not to say that markets are behaving as usual, however. Through Thursday US stocks had plunged 7% since Trump announced plans to ramp up tariffs on dozens of countries on April 2. Rather than tumble, 30-year yields actually rose around 40 basis points in the span, only the fifth time in data going back to the 1970s that moves of this magnitude have occurred simultaneously. A raft of traders and hedge fund strategies have struggled to navigate the recent volatility, leading to steep losses. The surge in yields also poses a risk to Trump’s stated goal of cutting taxes while reining in the US budget deficit, and was at least in part behind his decision Wednesday to announce a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for dozens of countries. “Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards,” Summers, who is also a paid Bloomberg contributor, wrote this week in a social media post. “We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market,” he said, adding that “this could set off all kinds of vicious spirals, given government debts and deficits and dependence on foreign purchasers.” If foreign investors do decide to continue retreating from US assets, the pain could be substantial. They hold about $7 trillion in Treasuries, $19 trillion of equities and $5 trillion of corporate debt, accounting for about 20% to 30% of the total market, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management Inc. If recent history is any guide, a buyers’ strike may have long-lasting repercussions for US borrowing costs. Just three years ago, investor pushback against UK Prime Minister Liz Truss’s unfunded tax cuts fuelled a surge in yields the country has yet to recover from, while the pound has never fully bounced back from the Brexit vote in 2016. “There is a distrust by the market created by the on-off tariffs, and that definitely adds an uncertainty premium,” said Shamil Gohil, a portfolio manager at Fidelity International. “Large fiscal deficits will lead to continued concerns on debt sustainability which will likely require some risk premium to hold Treasuries.” Nathan Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said Treasuries still dominate global markets in terms of quality and depth, but acknowledged that recent events have chipped away at investor confidence. “Much of the challenge we have seen over the last decade have been policy dynamics or geopolitical dynamics that were driven outside of the United States,” he said. “It’s a different dynamic this time, which is causing people to be less confident in US assets, both on the equity side and on the fixed-income side. There has probably been some permanent damage.” It’s also different this time because the Fed, worried about how tariffs could fuel a jump in inflation, is less likely to bail out the bond market by lowering rates anytime soon. “You can’t count on” long-term Treasuries as a hedge, said Russell Brownback, a portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc. “That is the fixed-income regime we are in now.”

Title: The global impact of Trump’s trade war and how China can win…by losing

May be Beijing and Washington have taken up their battle positions and are firing at each other, but we should be clear that in such an extended war the consequences will affect everyone and there is a very serious possibility that the changes will not only be economic… If someone three months ago presented as realistic the scenario of the White House deciding to re-draw the global “deck” at the risk of bringing decades-old enemies to the same table to discuss how to deal with their until recently most important ally, it would have caused the least smirk. Yet the fact that Japan and South Korea on their own initiative are in discussions on a new joint engagement project in Asia with China shows the extent not of the theoretical concern but the real dimension of the problem. When the world’s largest fund manager – BlackRock – officially and especially publicly declares that the US is currently the main agent of instability in the world with the policies it chooses, then the issue is much deeper and more serious than announcements and tariff rates. The markets in the US have decided to send a clear message to the Administration immediately and that is why we are also seeing significant changes in US bond yields which are at 5% for the first time since 2020 and the serious consequences – and economic – that the pandemic has brought with it. Behind these particular moves, in fact, it seems that China, which is the world’s second largest holder of US debt, is not – at least not yet – behind them. Donald Trump may not have made a public appearance yesterday as he was in hospital for hours for his scheduled annual health check that every President goes through but through the White House spokeswoman he indicated that even now what he is waiting for is for Beijing to pick up the phone to negotiate. What is expressed as a wish from the oval office is unlikely to happen, at least not immediately, as China for its part appears ready to bear the costs – at least to some extent – that will result from US economic “fire”. Beijing also appears to have prepared an initial contingency plan to deal with possible consequences of factory closures or shutdowns in the country, and it is not out of the question for China to turn to more significant measures against the US if Trump insists on increasing pressure. Outside of China, however, there is significant – unprecedented for this century, analysts note – mobility around the world at the political and diplomatic level. The visit of the Prime Minister of Spain to Beijing may not have been “over-analysed”, but it is indicative that in the Union member states, beyond the common line, have chosen to move individually in order to reduce as quickly as possible the risks of recession that are visible to all. China, which seems to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, stating that “we will not continue the tariff game”, seems to have a clear plan to cover – or at least attempt to do so – the gaps that the US has diplomatically and politically chosen to leave, especially in Europe. What is produced in the first year from these meetings may be “small” or even unworthy of political analysis, but in the big picture of the future it is the beginning of discussions with a country that the US has traditionally isolated with the political and long-standing solid alliances it has built over 8 decades… Today Beijing has the opportunity again by paying a heavy price to find itself in a different diplomatic and political position. A position that may in the long run also require significant structural changes from Beijing itself, but ultimately a position that brings the country officially into the limelight as the second major pole of the world. With Trump’s manipulations, China gains – by losing – its official position and recognition at the “table” of the world’s greats. Explore related questions

Title: Trump puts US dollar’s role as dominant world currency up for grabs

The US dollar, by historical norms, is living it large well into borrowed time. Since 1450, only five other powers have enjoyed having a currency that dominated global trade and, in more recent centuries, the vaults of the world’s central banks: Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands (known as the Dutch Republic at the time), France and Britain. Each reign lasted an average of less than 95 years. The dollar took over in the early 1920s, according to many academics, even if it would be the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that established the postwar international financial system and cemented the greenback’s supremacy. The demise of the dollar has been called many times in recent decades as persistent budget deficits have led to soaring US government debt. Borrowings have tripled over the past 15 years alone, to about $36 trillion (€31.6 trillion). But inertia and what economists call “network effects” – where governments, businesses and banks continue to use a currency because everybody else does – kept such predictions in check. The dollar’s slump against most major currencies since Donald Trump announced his ‘Liberation Day’ raft of tariffs last week has reignited the debate. It has fallen by as much as 5.7 per cent against the euro, with most of the sell-off occurring since Trump paused most of the charges on Wednesday evening, spooked by volatility on the bond market. Could this time be different? “I think we are at the start of the end [of the dollar era], but only at a start,” Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, told The Irish Times on Friday. “But the issue, right now, is: what are the available alternatives?” The benefits of being the reserve currency have been many. It’s given the US and its citizens greater buying power and access to lower borrowing rates – boosting economic growth – than they might otherwise enjoy. The dollar’s centrality to the global payments system has strengthened the US’s diplomatic power, making it easier to impose and enforce financial sanctions against countries, individuals and entities that it has problems with. About a quarter of the US’s $36 trillion debt is owned by foreign investors. Mortier sees the percentage held by domestic players, including retail investors, increasing amid signals from Trump’s officials that they would like to ease bank capital reserves rules so they could hold more US bonds and potential incentives encourage retail investors to buy government debt. This might allow a country – such as Japan, whose bonds are about 88 per cent owned by domestic investors – to run higher debt burdens than would otherwise be tolerated by the markets. “But the side effect is that the US dollar – and buying power – will continue to weaken,” says Mortier. Some argue that bitcoin, the teenage granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, will be reserve currency of the future. Indeed, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, posited in his annual letter to shareholders last week that this is a risk if the US doesn’t get its debt under control The main driver of the renewed market pressure on the dollar in recent days has been the escalation of the US-China trade war, with the White House clarifying on Thursday that total tariffs on China would now be 145 per cent, even as it has reduced tariffs on the rest of the world to 10 per cent – for 90 days. “The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered – we are experiencing one in full force,” said Francesco Pesole, a foreign exchange strategist at ING. Large questions marks hang over whether the US can strike a flurry of trade agreements with other nations before the 90 days are out. “There has been little respite for the dollar,” said Deutsche Bank strategists in a note on Friday, “as markets continue to reassess how much of the historical premium for US assets stemming from American exceptionalism is still justified under the radical vision and volatile policy of the new US administration.” There are no obvious successors, however. The euro may be the world’s second most traded currency and number two in the stockpiles of monetary authorities. But the euro zone doesn’t have a proper capital markets union – despite the European Commission’s best efforts over the past decade – let alone a fiscal union. The euro-zone debt crisis hasn’t helped. The euro accounted for less than 20 per cent of global reserves last year, down from peak of almost 28 per cent in 2009, according to International Monetary Fund data. The dollar accounts for about 58 per cent of global reserves. The big problem with adopting the renminbi, which makes up just 2.2 per cent of global reserves despite China being the world’s second-largest economy, is the country’s lack of rule of law and its one-party state. Some argue that bitcoin, the teenage granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, will be reserve currency of the future. Indeed, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, posited in his annual letter to shareholders last week that this is a risk if the US doesn’t get its debt under control. But bitcoin has a long way to go to establish itself as a store of value. Over the past six months alone it has almost doubled in price to peak at more than $109,000 before falling back by a third. “Instead of a radical transformation, we believe currency reserves are likely to go through an evolutionary process,” said Atul Bhatia, an investment strategist at RBC Wealth Management, in a report this week. “Falling trade will lead to slower global growth and declining reserve needs, but the reduction will likely be done passively. Some countries may choose to rebalance part of their holdings away from the dollar, but the lack of ‘safe’ investment options for non-dollar currencies will act as a constraint, in our opinion.” For Mortier at Amundi, too, there is unlikely to be one winner, but a broader spread of currencies in reserves, to include the euro, pound, Swiss franc, renminbi and Japanese yen – along with the dollar. “We are at a pivotal moment of structural shift that is very important for the world, for the global economy,” he said. “And what is happening now is a kind of acceleration ... of the US losing its status as the only superpower.” Joe Brennan is Markets Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns of recession amid Donald Trump's tariffs: ‘I think we’re very close…’

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday raised concerns over the possible negative growth of the US economy and a looming recession as the trade war escalates. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said in an interview with CNBC. As US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on April 2, fears of economic slowdown arose along with a sell-off in the stock market. On Wednesday, Trump declared a 90-day pause on tariffs, which will not help much to restore the US economy, according to Fink. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. And we now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty,” he said. According to Fink, the US economy is at risk in the short run, while he pinned hopes on artificial intelligence and advanced infrastructure to provide “transformative investment opportunities.” to enable economic growth in the long run. On Friday, Fink addressed the reciprocal tariff announcement on a call with analysts after the company reported first-quarter financial results. “The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” the BlackRock CEO said. Fink is not the first CEO to warn about the possibility of a recession. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon raised alarm over a looming recession, saying the odds of a recession in the US are at 50 per cent. Previously, the JPMorgan Chase CEO also told Fox Business that a recession is a “likely outcome” of raising tariffs. “I am going to defer to my economists at this point, but I think probably that's (recession) a likely outcome,” he said. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted that a trade war may lead to higher inflation and slower growth. "We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation," he said. “We are rapidly headed towards recession,” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategies at Academy Securities told Bloomberg. “The world was prepared for ‘reciprocal tariffs.’ Whatever the abomination that was launched at the Rose Garden was, it is a disaster — mostly for the US, but also for the global economy," Tchir added. “If the 25% tariff is fully implemented quickly and largely maintained, and US trading partners retaliate approximately tit-for-tat, the U.S. and global economies will not suffer a depression, but they will suffer serious recessions,” Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics wrote on X. “The recession will hit imminently and extend until next year. Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario,” Zandi added. On April 2, Donald Trump unveiled steep reciprocal tariffs on several countries and later paused them for 90 days on Wednesday. After the tariffs were first announced, global markets witnessed a severe selloff, which was later recovered on the announcement of 90-day pause.

The Season of Discovery versions of the original Darkmoon Cards are now obtainable from their quests. Songflower Lullaby, Dark Fortune of Damage, and Blessing of Neptulon will no longer cancel when entering instances. Players can now go into Blackwing Lair and change any Tier 2 items with Tier 1 set bonuses back into the Tier 2 item with Tier 2 set bonuses. Draught of the Sands for Hunters and Rogues will no longer erroneously stack under certain conditions. Unbalancing Strike from the Twin Emperors encounter in the Temple of Ahn’Qiraj will no longer affect the bonus attack power or spell damage gained from Defender’s Resolve. You will always gain these stats based on your pre-Unbalancing Strike defense skill. Druid Hunter Mage Priest Rogue Shaman Warlock December 9, 2024 Season of Discovery December 10, 2024 Season of Discovery December 11, 2024 Season of Discovery December 9, 2024 Season of Discovery The hotfix above was implemented to make it so that the Mixology benefit (where an Alchemist could create 2-5 flasks if they had completed the required quest) now works correctly. It was not working before, due to the stack limitation. Your local Alchemist was not holding out on you, they just weren’t getting procs until the fix above was implemented.
