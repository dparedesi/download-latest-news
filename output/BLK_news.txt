Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at a press conference during the DealBook Summit that he has reversed his earlier skepticism about Bitcoin and now considers his previous views to have been wrong. He described the shift as a major change in his thinking about Bitcoin and crypto. As he put it, “I have very strong views but that does not mean I am not open. My thought process is always evolving and this is a clear public example of a major shift in my opinions.” The shift marks a significant evolution for the world’s largest asset manager, which oversees investment products including exchange-traded funds focused on traditional and digital assets. Fink has compared Bitcoin to gold for its potential in providing uncorrelated returns in investment portfolios. BlackRock’s embrace of digital assets extends beyond rhetoric. The firm manages the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, an exchange-traded fund that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price through a regulated vehicle.

Title: Bitcoin’s biggest booster Michael Saylor fights to stave off an $8 billion collapse and being the first major crypto domino to fall

Billionaire Michael Saylor has been in tight spots before but nothing like this. The share price of Saylor’s firm, Strategy, which owns over 3% of the world’s Bitcoin, is down dramatically. Worse, the company faces twin headwinds in the form of a bearish crypto market and an impending rule change that will likely trigger a mass selloff of its stock. On Monday, the company announced a $1.2 billion reserve fund to meet impending interest and dividend obligations, but that did little to prop up its shares. All of this fueled fresh attacks from Saylor’s critics who say Strategy’s unusual business model, which revolves around selling stock to buy Bitcoin, is unsustainable or even a Ponzi scheme. Saylor has ridden out storms in the past. That includes an accounting scandal in 2000 that almost sank one of his previous companies and saw him lose $6 billion of his personal fortune in a day. Saylor’s defenders, meanwhile, dismiss critics as knee-jerk Bitcoin detractors who don’t understand the currency or the corporate finance techniques underlying Strategy’s operations. Saylor may escape from this bind, as he has in the past, but this time the stakes are higher. In recent years, Strategy’s purchases have helped fuel crypto’s record rise, and turned Saylor into Bitcoin’s leading evangelist. This means any move by Strategy to dump part of its holdings—something its CEO hinted last week could happen—would not only depress prices, but could spark a crisis of confidence and a broader selloff. Meanwhile, a further plunge in Strategy’s share price could not only threaten its future viability, but spur the collapse of dozens of other firms that have copied its business model. The coming months are likely to demonstrate once and for all whether Saylor is a pioneer in crypto finance, as his backers claim, or just another high-stakes gambler whose luck has run out. The crypto industry likes to hail October as “Uptober,” but this year failed to deliver the customary double-digit price boost. Instead, the month brought one of the biggest wipeouts in the industry’s history, and for Strategy, the month brought an extra helping of bad news when, on Oct. 10, financial giant MSCI proposed a new rule that would exclude it from a series of popular indexes. This delisting process, which looks set to go into effect in February, would oblige fund managers around the world to shed their holdings of Strategy, and other firms whose assets consist of 50% or more of crypto. In November, JPMorgan warned the rule change could see funds dump $2.3 billion worth of Strategy shares, and that the selloff could climb to over $8 billion if other index compilers followed MSCI’s example. The market’s growing awareness about MSCI’s plans has already triggered a selloff. Shares of MSTR (the MSTR ticker sign reflects Strategy’s previous name, Microstrategy) are down around 50% since Oct. 1. This has led a key metric known as mNAV, which reflects the value of a crypto company’s shares as a ratio of its Bitcoin holdings, to drop below one on several recent occasions. For a company whose mNAV a year ago reached around 2.45, the current figure underscores how the longtime premium that Strategy shares held over Bitcoin has evaporated. In response to such a spate of bad news, most CEOs would have issued a series of muted statements asking for patience. But Saylor is not an ordinary CEO and has instead responded by cranking up the number of memes he posts on social media. The memes extol Bitcoin and depict Saylor in AI-generated action hero poses—leading his many acolytes to retweet the memes or post their own version of them. These meme tactics have served Saylor well in the past, turning Strategy into a momentum play during bull markets. More recently, though, the gimmick has failed to stanch the stock’s downturn, and last month, Saylor posted a rare social media misfire. Seeking to rebut a rumor the company was selling its Bitcoin, Saylor shared an image of himself riding a life preserver in storm-tossed seas as a flaming ocean liner sank behind him. Critics, including Saylor fans, pointed out the meme implied Strategy’s captain was saving himself at a time of trouble rather than going down with his ship. HODL pic.twitter.com/sQysm4i88t Regardless of Saylor’s intent, the minor controversy raises questions about whether Strategy will resort to selling its Bitcoin holdings—a move the company has portrayed as unthinkable but, in recent weeks, appears set to accept. In late November, Strategy acquired 130 Bitcoin, bringing its total hoard to an even 650,000, which is worth around $58.5 billion at early December prices. For context, that amounts to around 3.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million (95% of which has been mined), and makes Strategy the biggest holder of the currency save for its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose 1.1 million coins are believed to be gone forever. According to Saylor, the company has paid an average price of $74,436 per Bitcoin, spending a total of around $48.4 billion, including fees and expenses. In order to pull this off, Strategy has needed a source of capital, and given that Bitcoin does not produce any yield, the company’s go-to technique has been to sell common shares to fund its purchases. A big upside to this approach is that, unlike debt, common shares do not create any financial obligations for the company. That’s not the case, though, with preferred shares—and Strategy has issued plenty of these as well, which obliges it to pay regular dividends to shareholders. These obligations include payments of roughly $200 million that are due by Dec. 31, the bulk of which are owed in the form of dividends (Strategy, like most companies, also carries some debt). In order to project a sense of financial stability, Strategy took the unusual step in early December of creating a so-called dollar reserve of $1.4 billion that Saylor says will be enough to cover the next 21 months of dividend obligations. Saylor announced the reserve fund at a Dec. 1 investor presentation where he added, with his usual bravado: “It’s our intention to keep stacking Bitcoin.” In the near future, though, that goal is likely to be aspirational and Strategy may instead find itself selling Bitcoin instead. “We can sell Bitcoin and we would sell Bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments below 1x mNAV,” Strategy CEO Phong Le said on a podcast last Friday. It was a remarkable statement from a company that is premised on the value of Bitcoin always increasing. More remarkable was when Saylor, who frequently exhorts the popular hold-on-to-your-Bitcoin phrase “HODL,” repeated on Monday that Strategy could sell some Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Strategy CFO Andrew Kang qualified the statement by saying the company planned to sell Bitcoin as a last resort and only if mNAV stays below one for a “very extended period.” Whatever the specifics, Strategy’s acknowledgment it could sell Bitcoin combined with the new dollar reserve fund has sparked a new wave of vitriol from Strategy critics. Those include Peter Schiff, an advocate for the gold industry and longtime crypto critic, who claims the company is coming undone, and that Saylor is the “biggest con man” on Wall Street. Today is the beginning of the end of $MSTR. Saylor was forced to sell stock not to buy Bitcoin, but to buy U.S. dollars merely to fund MSTR's interest and dividend obligations. The stock is broken. The business model is a fraud, and @Saylor is the biggest con man on Wall Street. If Schiff’s view—hardly a consensus one—is correct and Strategy has to liquidate, then the broader crypto market could be hit hard since the selloff would almost certainly trigger a downward price spiral for Bitcoin. Even if Strategy has to sell only a portion of its holdings, it could trigger a contagion in which hundreds of other so-called digital asset treasuries (DATs) do the same. But even as skeptics label Strategy and the DAT model as a house of cards built on financial chicanery, others view them as early leaders in an emerging category of crypto banks. Whatever one thinks of Saylor, there is no denying he is a natural showman. In his Dec. 1 presentation announcing the new U.S. dollar reserve, he displayed a futuristic-looking spaceship in garish green and orange with a Bitcoin powered reactor at its core. “Think of [the dollar reserve] as a $USD battery. We’re basically using a nuclear reactor to spin a generator to charge a battery,” explained Saylor. For Saylor’s detractors, all of this smacks of the worst type of hucksterism. Others see a visionary who is using compelling metaphors and imagery to help the public understand a complex new financial mechanism. The latter include Sebastian Bea, a former longtime BlackRock executive and Olympic rower, who is now president of a digital asset treasury called ReserveOne. According to Bea, Saylor is pursuing a sophisticated long-term strategy, and has surrounded himself with a team of corporate finance experts, including board member Peter Briger, who has had a distinguished career at Goldman Sachs and Fortress Investment Group. In this context, Saylor’s plans to purchase a growing supply of Bitcoin by tapping into capital markets for equity, commodities, and derivatives makes sense. As he and Strategy’s CFO explained this week, that plan includes bringing in revenue by lending Bitcoin and selling covered call options. For all of this to work, though, the value of Bitcoin will have to keep appreciating. This notion strikes crypto skeptics as absurd, but crypto advocates point out correctly that Bitcoin has grown faster than nearly any other asset over the past decade, and is poised for longer-term gains as large entities ranging from sovereign wealth funds to university endowments add it to their portfolios. In the latest bullish signal, Vanguard—which has refused to add crypto to its portfolio for years—elected to add Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs this week. If Bitcoin does keep appreciating, Strategy will be able to keep obtaining credit against the surplus value in the same way a company can do with real estate in a desirable market. There will of course be downturns but, according to Bea, Strategy “has planned for this” and has a healthy overall asset to debt ratio. Bea adds that the recent wave of digital asset treasury companies are akin to a new type of bank, and that their model is evolving rapidly. He points out that some, including ReserveOne, are based around cryptocurrencies like Ethereum that do provide yield unlike Bitcoin, which provides additional breathing room on the corporate finance front. Bea acknowledged that the impending move by MSCI to exclude DATs from indexes could be a significant headwind, and said that companies based around crypto holdings need time to evolve. Cosmo Jiang, a partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Pantera, likewise believes that digital asset treasuries—including a Solana-focused company he is backing—will become a permanent feature of the financial landscape. “We’re seeing the genesis of a whole new category of business,” Jiang told Fortune, adding that DATs are poised to earn significant revenue from the fast-growing world of decentralized finance. In separate remarks to Bloomberg, Jiang made the case that the sector is currently at a low point, but that the current malaise around Strategy and similar firms is temporary. “We’re at the point where all the bad news is out there, and the bears are the loudest voices in the room.” Jiang noted, however, that many in the recent wave of crypto-hoarding companies are unlikely to survive, and that the business model required not just a stash of tokens, but deep experience in capital markets and corporate finance. “There will be two or three large winners” for each major cryptocurrency, he predicted. If this is the case, the coming months will likely determine whether one of those is Strategy.

Title: U.S. Debt Growth Will Drive Crypto's Gains, BlackRock Says in Report on AI

Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, laid out its vision for 2026 and — reading past its bearish outlook for U.S. bonds and the world's largest economy — it’s a bullish blueprint for institutional crypto adoption. U.S. federal debt will swell past $38 trillion, setting the tone for a market outlook defined by fragility and the failure of traditional hedges, according to the report. For crypto that's good news, because this economic environment will lead to accelerated digital asset adoption among the Wall Street behemoths. More government borrowing "... creates vulnerabilities to shocks such as bond yield spikes tied to fiscal concerns or policy tensions between managing inflation and debt servicing costs," the report said. The warning on long-term U.S. Treasuries, the traditional backbone of finance, is a signal AI-driven leverage and government debt is likely to make the financial system more fragile, and may compel institutions to turn to alternative assets like bitcoin BTC$92,162.24 as a hedge against fiscal failure. The institutional flood of money into crypto, exemplified by the BlackRock’s $100 billion in bitcoin ETF allocations, its top revenue source, promises to take digital assets to all-time highs next year, with some analysts forecasting the largest cryptocurrency will climb to more than $200,000. This is all part of a "modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system," which provides the decentralized infrastructure to handle the private credit and asset management institutions seek. CEO Larry Fink described tokenization as the next generation of financial markets. The world’s largest asset manager’s report says it clearly: where government debt fails, the digital economy begins. ​​As for stablecoins, digital assets whose value is pegged to a real-world asset like the dollar or gold, they "are no longer niche, they're becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity," said Samara Cohen, Blackrock's global head of market development. The surge in computing power to drive AI is already benefiting bitcoin miners, who are able to parlay their energy deals into new uses as surging demand for high-performance computing drives up the value of their infrastructure. The AI buildout is constrained not by chips, but by power, accordion the report. In fact, AI data centers could demand up to 20% of current U.S. electricity by 2030. Several publicly traded mining firms reported increased revenue this year not just from mining, but from leasing out data center capacity to AI companies in need of power-hungry GPUs.

Title: Secretive $3T Fund Giant Makes Flashy Move Into Private Assets

Capital Group is teaming up with KKR to add private credit to its fund lineup and retirement portfolios. December 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Capital Group succeeded in keeping a low profile for almost a century, not even posting a sign outside its sprawling Los Angeles headquarters to call attention to its presence, as it offered millions of investors an array of mutual funds branded with a different humdrum name. But over much of the past decade, the firm looked on while rivals reinvented themselves and the rise of passive index investing and exchange-traded funds eroded its core business. Now, insiders say the world’s biggest active-only money manager can’t afford to watch from the sidelines any longer. In a break from its traditionally staid and secretive approach, the firm is embarking on a splashy marketing campaign, expanding its lineup of ETFs and ramping up a private-markets partnership with buyout giant KKR & Co. that it hopes will attract more retail money. The efforts, led by Chief Executive Officer Mike Gitlin, amount to one of Capital Group’s biggest strategic shifts since its 1931 founding. In an industry under immense pressure to change, the $3.3 trillion firm — best known for its lineup of American Funds and a big investor in the S&P 500’s top five companies including Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — is worried about getting left behind as private-markets rivals such as Apollo Global Management Inc. and Blackstone Inc. ramp up their own initiatives to attract more retail investors. Related:Smaller Loans, Big Impact: Direct Lending Excels in the Lower Middle Market “Every single client is shrinking their list of preferred partners,” Gitlin, 55, who declined an interview request, said in an emailed response to questions, adding that raising the firm’s voice reinforces its position with clients and helps attract new ones. “We’re constantly evolving.” Wealth advisers are narrowing rosters to just two or three managers that can offer a wide range of investing menus, including illiquid private-market strategies. New alliances are forming between established firms with access to everyday Americans and alternative asset managers that can originate privately negotiated deals. To that end, Gitlin is teaming up with KKR to launch funds for retail investors — and the pact is set to expand next year, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg. It includes Capital Group’s first target-date fund for retirement plans that will contain public and private assets, as well as a similar model portfolio for retail investors. The firm will also manage some money for KKR’s Global Atlantic insurance arm. The partnership is designed to give investors diversified portfolios that blend public and private markets, according to KKR Co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. “Together, we can help close the gap between what’s available to institutions and what’s accessible to everyday savers,” they said in an emailed statement. Related:InspereX Teams with SUBSCRIBE, Luma to Launch Alts Platform This story is based on conversations with more than 20 people familiar with Capital Group whoasked not to be identified discussing internal matters. There’s a lot at stake for Gitlin, the former Citigroup Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. sales and trading executive, who took the helm in 2023, after investors had begun to turn away from the very mutual funds that long fueled Capital Group’s success. For each of the past 10 years, clients pulled more money out of the firm’s equity mutual funds and related products than they put in. Inflows into fixed-income and retirement products and new ETFs are beginning to mitigate those redemptions, which had persisted since 2021. “Private markets are the natural next frontier for asset managers like Capital Group,” said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, which invests in other money managers. “They can’t keep growing or even maintain their AUM by just continuing to do what they’ve done before. They have to evolve more than ever, but it's an increasingly crowded space, so it won’t be easy.” Related:Rowan Says People ‘Lost Their Minds’ Over Private Credit Fears So far, two new funds with KKR have more than $500 million of assets under management. “It would take us 50 years to create KKR’s 50-year track record,” Gitlin said, adding that a partnership was always more likely than expanding through acquisitions. Capital Group’s clandestine and quirky culture — some even call it cult-like — has long fascinated the industry. Employees — in phone conversations, emails and meetings — are known by a combination of letters relating to their initials instead of their actual names. “Performance” is a shunned word, as it’s deemed to be better suited for the stage. Instead, executives talk about “results.” Given that the average tenure of portfolio managers is about two decades, these idiosyncrasies have become embedded in the culture. The firm has even branded its own management approach: the Capital System. Every portfolio is split across a team of managers and analysts, with each overseeing their own sleeve to avoid “star manager” risk. Junior employees expend a lot of time and energy networking internally, with potentially big rewards for those who can climb the ladder to become partner, which comes with life-changing compensation. Pay packages have elicited envy, with top portfolio managers earning about $10 million a year. But true to the firm’s typical pace, that doesn’t happen quickly, even for the best performers. Long-term bonuses aren’t paid based on the amount of assets managed, but on one-, three-, five- and eight-year track records, with more weight given to the latter, which discourages portfolio managers from making outsize short-term bets. With its push into privates, Capital Group is discarding some of the legacy peculiarities to appeal to retail investors. This year, it commissioned a hot-air balloon dubbed Winds of Frankfurt emblazoned with the firm's logo to fly over Germany to promote its business there. In September, it set up a pickleball court at an industry event in California that attracted thousands of financiers. Gitlin, described by some insiders as a driven salesman, is getting into the act, too: He hosts podcasts with the firm’s investors and sports stars, and posted photos of himself at the beach and elsewhere while he trained for a half-marathon. Like others in the industry, Gitlin is taking to social media to engage directly with a new prospective audience and shape the firm’s story. There are some personnel changes afoot, including the nature of Gitlin’s role as CEO. The firm has grown more complex and began pumping out new products in recent years, competing with the likes of BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in actively managed ETFs. As a result, Gitlin was tasked with solely running the business, rather than also managing money as his predecessors had done. There also has been turnover among senior executives, a rare occurrence historically, with at least five recent departures. They include Maddi Dessner, head of global asset class services, and Ryan Murphy, product leader of public-private strategies. Beth Rodenhuis, who oversaw digital products, left to become chief operating officer at Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. Meanwhile, more outsiders are joining the top ranks. The firm is hiring for a head of private markets — a newly created position — and brought on a prominent Washington lobbying firm with close ties to the Trump administration. Joseph Lai, a former McKinsey & Co. partner and leader in its asset-management practice, was tapped to become senior vice president of strategy, digital capabilities and analytics. The challenge for the firm has grown more apparent within the past decade. Its ETFs, which debuted in 2022, account for about $100 billion of assets — and before taking the helm, Gitlin built the fixed-income business into apowerhouse with more than $600 billion. But that still hasn’t been enough to completely offset the redemptions from its core lineup of American Funds. Read More: Capital Group Builds Bond Team to Chase Pimco in Fixed Income Capital Group’s mutual fund business has long been dominated by a relatively small list of very large US equity funds that have often beaten benchmarks and rivals. But its biggest mutual fund — Growth Fund of America, which dates to 1973 — shows the limits of its investing prowess when clients continue to march toward ETFs or low-cost index funds. With about $340 billion of client assets, it’s the largest actively managed mutual fund in the US, and it’s held in retirement and individual brokerage accounts for years at a time. Its performance has boosted assets roughly 40% over the past five years, fueled by large holdings in Nvidia, Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as a leading stake in Broadcom Inc. It also has one of the largest mutual fund stakes in OpenAI. That apparently hasn’t been enough for clients, who pulled $122 billion from the fund since the start of 2015 through September, according to Morningstar Inc. “Mutual funds remain in net outflows across the industry,” Gitlin said. “But overall we’re seeing strong demand for our investment services.” Capital Group, which previously dabbled in private markets, deliberated for roughly two years over how to grow in the asset class. Its portfolio managers regularly talk about investing in companies for the long term rather than trading in their shares, somewhat similar to take-private deals. Decades ago, it had a relationship with Sequoia Capital, the famed Silicon Valley tech investor, and some of its employees were able to invest in Sequoia’s funds, amassing considerable wealth in the process. Capital Group also briefly had an emerging-markets private equity strategy that struggled to grow and then shuttered. This time it’s trying to do private markets at scale and with its own resources. The hunt for a partner came with some fanfare, including pitches from KKR competitors including Apollo, Blackstone and Carlyle Group Inc. Top executives from some of those firms visited Capital Group’s headquarters, and Capital Group managers traveled to the East Coast for additional talks. Capital Group’s distribution network and relationships with legions of financial advisers was the crown jewel, as the winning bidder would inherit access to potentially millions of clients. The firm has relationships with more than 20 million households, and about 75% of all US financial advisers — roughly 216,000 in all — have Capital Group or American Funds in their portfolios. A meeting at Gitlin’s home with KKR’s Nuttall clinched the deal. KKR won because of its range of investment strategies and lack of overlap with what each firm was already offering: KKR can originate private assets, and Capital Group can bundle them to sell through its vast network of salespeople. The pair noted publicly that their cultures were among the most aligned. The two new funds, Capital Group KKR Core Plus+ and Capital Group KKR Multi-Sector+, have targets of 60% publicly traded debt and 40% private credit, including direct loans and debt backed by tangible assets. Two more planned funds will include private equity and real assets, according to the memo seen by Bloomberg. Negotiations on economics and break clauses for the partnership went down to the wire, with final terms being hashed out in the hours before it was announced. Agreeing on fees was among the thorniest challenges. Capital Group’s funds typically charge 0.2%to 1% of assets. By comparison,some KKR funds for wealthy individuals — in the K Series — levy management fees of more than 1% and performance fees of roughly 12%. The co-run funds charge as little as 0.84% and 0.89%, with no incentive fee. KKR will earn fees on the amount of assets it manages for the public-private credit funds. Another source of friction: differing expectations about how quickly products can be rolled out. KKR has been trying to accelerate the timing of some of the funds, while Capital Group has been taking a more deliberative approach, according to people familiar with the matter. A Capital Group spokesperson said the two firms are aligned on timing. Capital Group hasn’t pitched itself directly to investors historically, preferring to distribute funds through so-called wholesalers to financial advisers, who then market them to retail clients. American Funds are regularly among the top financial distribution relationships with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill. American Funds’ ties with Edward Jones, a firm with more than 20,000 financial advisers, is among the tightest in the history of mutual funds. American Funds paid Edward Jones $125 million in revenue-sharing agreements last year, more than triple the next largest recipient, and more than JPMorgan, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Ltd. combined, according to disclosures by Edward Jones. LPL Financial Holdings Inc., which services thousands of advisers, receives as much as 0.035% of assets invested in American Funds, plus a flat annual payment of up to $5 million. The Capital Group-KKR products “are designed to be more accessible and easier to implement,” Cheri Belski, LPL’s head of investment management solutions, said in an emailed statement. The race to capture the trillions of dollars of wealth in the hands of retail investors may be one of the biggest opportunities of the next decade, and Capital Group’s deep ties with such clients could position it to be one of the winners. “The partnership and push into private assets is potentially a big identity shift for Capital Group,” said St. Aubin, the Ocean Park CIO. “How it positions itself will be key.” To contact the authors of this story:Laura Benitez in Los Angeles at [email protected]Silla Brush in New York at [email protected] Laura Benitez Silla Brush You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Copyright © 2025 Informa Connect Limited.

Title: BlackRock bets on tokenization, but IMF warns of uncontrollable ‘atomic’ domino effect

Time Published: 2025-12-03T14:30:28Z

Both BlackRock and the IMF acknowledge the potential of tokenization, but differ on its long-term effects. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, has described tokenization as the most critical market upgrade since the early internet. On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) describes it as a volatile, untested architecture that can amplify financial shocks at machine speed. Both institutions are looking at the same innovation. Yet, the distance between their conclusions captures the most consequential debate in modern finance: whether tokenized markets will reinvent global infrastructure or reproduce its worst fragilities with new velocity. In a Dec. 1 op-ed for The Economist, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein argued that recording asset ownership on digital ledgers represents the next structural step in a decades-long modernization arc. They framed tokenization as a financial leap comparable to the arrival of SWIFT in 1977 or the shift from paper certificates to electronic trading. In contrast, the IMF warned in a recent explainer video that tokenized markets could be prone to flash crashes, liquidity fractures, and smart-contract domino cascades that turn local failures into systemic shocks. The split over tokenization arises from the fact that the two institutions operate under very different mandates. BlackRock, which has already rolled out tokenized funds and dominates the spot ETF market for digital assets, approaches tokenization as an infrastructure play. Its incentive is to expand global market access, compress settlement cycles to “T+0,” and broaden the investable universe. In that context, blockchain-based ledgers look like the next logical step in the evolution of financial plumbing. This means the technology offers a way to strip out costs and latency in the traditional financial world. However, the IMF operates from the opposite direction. As the stabilizer of the global monetary system, it focuses on the hard-to-predict feedback loops that arise when markets operate at extremely high speed. Traditional finance relies on settlement delays to net transactions and conserve liquidity. Tokenization introduces instantaneous settlement and composability across smart contracts. That structure is efficient in calm periods but can propagate shocks far faster than human intermediaries can respond. These perspectives do not contradict each other so much as they reflect different layers of responsibility. BlackRock is tasked with building the next generation of investment products. The IMF is tasked with identifying the fault lines before they spread. Tokenization sits at the intersection of that tension. Fink and Goldstein describe tokenization as a bridge “built from both sides of a river,” connecting traditional institutions with digital-first innovators. They argue that shared digital ledgers can eliminate slow, manual processes and replace disparate settlement pipelines with standardized rails that participants across jurisdictions can verify instantly. This view is not theoretical, though the data requires careful parsing. According to Token Terminal, the broader tokenized ecosystem is approaching $300 billion, a figure heavily anchored by dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. However, the actual test lies in the roughly $30 billion wedge of regulated real-world assets (RWAs), such as tokenized Treasuries, private credit, and bonds. Indeed, these regulated assets are no longer restricted to pilot programs. Tokenized government bond funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Ondo’s products are now live. At the same time, precious metals have moved on-chain as well, with significant volumes in digital gold. The market has also seen fractionalized real estate shares and tokenized private credit instruments expand the investable universe beyond listed bonds and equities. In light of this, forecasts for this sector range from the optimistic to the astronomical. Reports from firms such as RedStone Finance project a “blue sky” scenario in which on-chain RWAs could reach $30 trillion by 2034. Meanwhile, more conservative estimates from McKinsey & Co. suggest the market could double as funds and treasuries migrate to blockchain rails. For BlackRock, even the conservative case represents a multi-trillion-dollar restructuring of financial infrastructure. Yet the IMF sees a parallel, less stable future. Its concern centers on the mechanics of atomic settlement. In today’s markets, trades are often “netted” at the end of the day, meaning banks only need to move the difference between what they bought and sold. Atomic settlement requires every trade to be fully funded instantly. In stressed conditions, this demand for pre-funded liquidity can spike, potentially causing liquidity to evaporate exactly when it is needed most. If automated contracts then trigger liquidations “like falling dominoes,” a localized problem could become a systemic cascade before regulators even receive the alert. Part of the enthusiasm around tokenization stems from the question of where the next cycle of market growth may originate. The last crypto cycle was characterized by memecoin-driven speculation, which generated high activity but drained liquidity without expanding long-term adoption. Advocates of tokenization argue that the next expansion will be driven not by retail speculation but by institutional yield strategies, including tokenized private credit, real-world debt instruments, and enterprise-grade vaults delivering predictable returns. Tokenization, in this framing, is not merely a technical upgrade but a new liquidity channel. Institutional allocators facing a constrained traditional yield environment may migrate to tokenized credit markets, where automated strategies and programmable settlement can yield higher, more efficient returns. However, this future remains unrealized because large banks, insurers, and pension funds face regulatory constraints. The Basel III Endgame rules, for example, assign punitive capital treatment to certain digital assets classified as “Group 2,” discouraging exposure to tokenized instruments unless regulators clarify the distinctions between volatile cryptocurrencies and regulated tokenized securities. Until that boundary is defined, the “wall of money” remains more potential than reality. Furthermore, the IMF argues that even if the funds arrive, they carry hidden leverage. A complex stack of automated contracts, collateralized debt positions, and tokenized credit instruments may create recursive dependencies. During periods of volatility, these chains can unwind faster than risk engines are designed to handle. The very features that make tokenization attractive, such as the instant settlement, composability, and global access, create feedback mechanisms that could amplify stress. The debate between BlackRock and the IMF is not about whether tokenization will integrate into global markets; it already has. It is about the trajectory of that integration. One path envisions a more efficient, accessible, globally synchronized market structure. The other anticipates a landscape where speed and connectivity create new forms of systemic vulnerability. However, in that future, the outcome will depend on whether global institutions can converge on coherent standards for interoperability, disclosure, and automated risk controls.

More Info Saudi Arabia has launched production at the giant Jafurah natural gas field, the largest non-associated gas development in the Kingdom, which is key to the Saudi goal to significantly boost its gas processing capacity to meet rising demand. Saudi Aramco, the state oil giant, has completed the first phase of the Jafurah Gas Plant construction and launched production at the field with a capacity of 450 million cubic feet per day, the Saudi Finance Ministry said in the 2026 Budget announcement. Sustainable production at Jafurah is expected to reach 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day after the project is completed by 2030, the ministry said in highlights of the key Saudi achievements in the 2025 fiscal year. Earlier this year, BlackRock, through its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, led an $11 billion lease deal with Saudi Aramco involving key natural gas infrastructure tied to the Jafurah project. With a price tag of a total of $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cubic feet of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. When completed by 2030, the huge project is also expected to produce 420 million standard cubic feet per day of ethane, and 630,000 barrels per day of high-value liquids by 2030. The Jafurah project is a cornerstone of Saudi Aramco’s strategic gas expansion, which focuses on supplying growing natural gas demand in the Kingdom while investing in global LNG markets. “Jafurah kickstarts our plan to expand our overall sales gas production capacity, which will contribute to Saudi Arabia’s growth ambitions across multiple sectors including energy, artificial intelligence, and major industries such as petrochemicals,” Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser said upon the completion of the $11-billion Jafurah midstream deal.

Title: Wall Street FOMO Over Vanguard’s Bitcoin ETF Pivot: $HYPER Rides the Wave
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/vanguard-etf-pivot-causes-fomo-as-hyper-rides-the-wave/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T12:45:15Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: For years, Vanguard stood out as the big asset manager that wanted nothing to do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. That stance quietly shifted, and the pivot matters. When a $9+ trillion retirement giant opens the door to $BTC exposure, it adds another massive gatekeeper to the on-ramp for mainstream capital. It saw $BTC rally on Tuesday, jumping back up to the $92K mark from a recent dip below the $86K region. You now have BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard funneling retirement portfolios, 401(k)s, and brokerage accounts into spot Bitcoin. That flow doesn’t just push up $BTC’s market cap; it changes how traditional investors think about crypto risk. Bitcoin starts to look like ‘digital gold core holding,’ not a speculative side bet. The knock-on effect is obvious for traders: if Bitcoin becomes the safe, ETF-wrapped asset, the search for higher-octane upside moves further out on the risk curve. That’s where ecosystem plays, infrastructure tokens, and early-stage presales come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself exactly in that lane, pitching itself as a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 with Solana-grade performance. As capital crowds into spot BTC via TradFi rails, the question for more aggressive crypto traders isn’t ‘Should I own Bitcoin?’ anymore. It’s ‘Where can I get leveraged exposure to the Bitcoin network’s growth without using actual leverage?’ Wall Street’s ETF embrace solves one thing: easy Bitcoin exposure inside familiar accounts. It doesn’t solve Bitcoin’s technical pain points. The base layer still processes roughly 7 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees that spike into double digits when mempools clog. That limitation is a feature for store-of-value purists, but a brick wall for anyone wanting DeFi, gaming, or consumer apps atop Bitcoin. So you’re seeing a rush of infrastructure projects racing to bolt smart contracts and high throughput onto $BTC without compromising its settlement assurances. Competing visions include Ordinals-centric tooling, sidechains like Rootstock, and experimental rollup frameworks. In that crowded field, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching itself as a unique contender, differentiating through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) compatibility. It has an explicit focus on traders and DeFi power users looking to amplify Bitcoin’s upside rather than just hold ETF shares. Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) markets itself as ‘the first ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration,’ aiming to deliver performance that can exceed Solana’s own execution speeds. Anchored by a canonical bridge that links Bitcoin’s security to high-speed execution, Bitcoin Hyper’s modular architecture combines the best of both worlds. The system relies on Bitcoin L1 for settlement while offloading processing to a real-time SVM Layer 2, where a single sequencer commits state roots on-chain. This bridge allows you to escape L1 congestion and access an ecosystem of instant, low-cost wrapped $BTC payments, NFTs, and DeFi. With support for Rust SDKs and Solana-style APIs, Bitcoin Hyper brings high-performance gaming and complex smart contracts to Bitcoin. If you want more info, check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide. The market seems to be paying attention as the Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised over $28.8M so far. And smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have been making purchases as large as $500K. Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.08625, which, if you bought at today’s price, would see you with a potential ROI of over 545%. If you believe Vanguard and its peers will keep funneling conservative capital into spot Bitcoin, Layer 2s like $HYPER offer a different angle: upside tied not just to $BTC’s price, but to whether Bitcoin can finally host high-throughput applications at scale. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

Title: Ron Johnson tells ‘Pod Force One’ he is perplexed by ‘bizarre’ mystery surrounding would-be Trump assassin

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ron Johnson raised concerns about the lack of information about would-be presidential assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks and defended his subpoena of the FBI for records on him during an interview on “Pod Force One.” “All of a sudden I realize, here we are a year later, I haven’t heard a peep out of this. We still don’t know about, what did his social media accounts say?” Johnson (R-Wis.) lamented on the podcast. “Why haven’t we unlocked this information? Why doesn’t America know more about it?” he added. “There’s some odd things about it, him appearing in commercials for, was it BlackRock, just like the other potential assassin down in Palm Beach. I mean, it’s just bizarre stuff. I mean, explain this to us.” Crooks was ultimately killed by countersnipers after getting off a shot that grazed the top of President Trump’s right ear during his fateful July 13, 2024, rally in Butler, Pa. The 20-year-old killed firefighter Corey Comperatore and injured two others. Johnson, who helms the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, subpoenaed the FBI back in July this year for records on Crooks amid those concerns. “My subpoenas to this administration are friendly subpoenas,” he explained, before later adding: “There’s so many enormous messes that Trump and his department heads are trying to clean up. Some of these are maybe a high priority to me or you, but they’ve got kind of bigger fish to fry.” The Wisconsin senator is hoping that the telecommunications companies will help with his investigation into unraveling some of the mysteries around Crooks. “I think this was a news outlet, it might have been New York Post [that] did a geo-positioning search on Crooks’ phone and kind of like that Family Circus deals, all over the place, the FBI headquarters,” Johnson recounted. “My staff kind of cautions me about talking about that, because we’re not quite sure of the validity of thatas well. But I mean, again, those are the kinds of questions that deserve answers,” he added. “It’s those kind of questions that go unanswered that just feed into conspiracy theories.” In February, The Post reported on how a private investigator who looked into Crooks concluded that one of the electronic devices geolocated with Crooks at several different places at the time of the shooting was still pinging in Bethel Park High School. That investigator was suspicious that Crooks didn’t act alone.

Title: Michael Dell, who’s donating $6.25 billion to ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids, says a childhood savings account changed his life

Good morning. Earlier this week, I spoke to Michael Dell about his plan to put $250 in the so-called Trump Accounts (now called Invest America accounts) of 25 million American kids when the savings program launches next year. The $6.25 billion donation is more than double the total amount that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has dispensed in its 26-year history. As he told me in a wide-ranging interview: “When children have accounts like this, their outlook on life just changes.” In some ways, it changed his. “When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I got a passbook savings account. I had maybe $6 or $7 in it. I’d go to the Savings & Loan, put in a quarter, and they’d stamp my book. I learned about compound interest and savings and, I’m like, ‘This is really cool,’” he said. “That ignited an interest in me. Hopefully, these accounts will cause children to want to learn more about compound interest and the companies in the S&P 500 and investing and saving.” Dell went on to famously create the company now known as Dell Technologies in his freshman dorm room at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984, and made enough money to start giving it away about a decade later, with the foundation launching in 1999. Of course, it’s easier to give away billions when you’re worth close to $150 billion, but Americans tend to be a generous lot. Overall, people gave $592.5 billion to U.S. charities last year, a new high that was no doubt boosted by stock market gains and a buoyant economy. It helps to have mechanisms that encourage giving, such as company matches and GivingTuesday, which the Dells chose for making their announcement. Brunswick Group CEO Henry Timms deserves credit for cofounding the GivingTuesday campaign in 2012 as a day for philanthropy following the big-spending traditions of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s since become a global ritual that raises billions in more than 60 countries. Dell, for one, approaches philanthropy less as a handout than as an investment. “We’re very results-oriented, data-driven, outcome-focused. We took all the lessons from business and treat every grant like an investment,” he said, adding that he and his wife have other significant announcements to come. “I’ve had the opportunity to create a significant impact on the world through Dell Technologies, but the goal that we’ve set is that we want our philanthropy to have an even bigger impact.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Anthropic preps for an IPO Anthropic has reportedly hired lawyers from Wilson Sonsini for an upcoming IPO that could be one of the largest listings ever.

Title: Lightning in a Bottle

Time Published: 2025-12-03T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Electricity is a public good, dating back to when rural electrification was a pressing need for the nation during the New Deal era. Yet control over this essential service today rests largely in the hands of private monopolies known as investor-owned utilities (IOUs), which provide power to nearly 70 percent of utility customers in the U.S. These monopolies are regulated at the state level by public utility commissions, which are responsible for setting rates. Utilities must justify any rate increases and convince regulators of the need for their actions. But 2025 may be the year that this regulatory framework collapses under its own contradictions. More from James Baratta In just the first half of the year, IOUs requested approval for an unprecedented $29 billion in additional revenue. They cited growing electricity demand, including from data centers powering artificial intelligence, needed upgrades to aging infrastructure, and mandates to decarbonize in several states. Yet rate hikes have also translated into skyrocketing CEO compensation and record-breaking profits for shareholders. And in many parts of the country, IOU rates are rising much faster than those of their municipally owned counterparts. This has put unbearable weight on customers. Electric bills are increasing at twice the rate of inflation on average. More than 52 million Americans were unable to pay their electric bills at least once last year, and on an annual basis, roughly three million people who cannot afford these bills have their electricity shut off. The myriad factors driving up electricity demand are “actually just shining a spotlight on the fundamental design of the utility system,” Isaac Sevier, founder and executive director of Public Grids, told the Prospect. And that design is badly broken, with public utility commissions either too confused or too captured to resist an onslaught of IOU pressure to approve rate hikes. Sevier believes this necessitates a rethink of how utilities deliver power in the U.S., and how to protect those who pay for it. He wants to restore a promising and proven alternative—public power. The movement to reclaim democratic control over utilities has cemented itself in communities across the country. In their outreach, public power advocates have connected soaring electricity prices with the need to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system, one that decouples investment planning from shareholder profits. ACCORDING TO CONSULTING FIRM ICF, load growth in the U.S. is projected to increase by 25 percent over the next five years. One of the biggest and most scrutinized factors for this is the historic expansion of data centers. Big Tech hyperscalers plan to spend up to $400 billion on the data center build-out just this year. To meet the colossal demand for AI and cloud services, data centers will more than double their 2024 energy consumption by the end of the decade. Just keeping up with all that demand would be costly for utilities. But a number of other issues are converging at once to squeeze the system. For instance, adding more power would meet demand and keep rates low, but interconnection queues can take years to hook up energy sources. As Grist reported, utilities “are now putting more than half of their expenditures into transmission and distribution through the end of the decade.” This has led to shortages of critical grid assets. More critically, IOUs have been slow to implement transformative upgrades like non-wires alternatives, which reduce reliance on traditional transmission infrastructure, and are instead plowing capital into legacy assets like poles and wires, with customers footing the bill. The IOU financial model disincentivizes grid improvements that would simply make things more efficient, as the Department of Energy (DOE) acknowledged in a report last year. Unlike investments in traditional infrastructure, modernizing the grid does not contribute to the growth of a utility’s rate base. Information asymmetry between utility commissions and utilities has given the latter carte blanche to squeeze ratepayers. Tariffs on metals like steel and aluminum have put upward pressure on construction expenses, further stalling grid upgrades and making it more costly to rebuild after disaster strikes. Hardening the grid is already an expensive endeavor ratepayers must finance. In California, utilities have spent more on underground transmission lines and passed insurance costs on to customers, while utilities in the Southeast have been known to seek higher rates to cover the cost of rebuilding after hurricanes. As the Trump administration pursues its policy of “American energy dominance,” the U.S. has continued to export more natural gas than it imports and is actively expanding its export capacity. That presents another problem for ratepayers, who find themselves more exposed to global gas market price swings. In 2022, U.S. households saw electric bills go up by almost 15 percent when the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused gas prices to spike. Trump’s full-frontal assault on renewables threatens to drive up electricity prices even further. Over the summer, he ordered the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce” the termination of wind and solar energy credits. In other words, it is now official policy to make clean-energy projects, which accounted for almost all new U.S. electrical generating capacity in the first four months of 2025, as unprofitable as possible. Fitting this together, you have the elements of a perfect storm: There’s a greater need for power at precisely the moment when there are limits, both real and artificial, on how much supply can be added. But against the backdrop of these factors, the IOUs are using their immense influence to push for even higher rates than the economic fundamentals would indicate. As a result, faith in the regulatory compact appears to be waning. IOUs ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A REGULATORY SYSTEM they built for themselves decades ago. They enabled the concept of public utility commissions as the electricity industry was built in the early 20th century, vowing that this setup would keep the rapaciousness of the profit motive in check. In reality, the idea was to cement private ownership of utilities and resist municipal control. And it set the stage for the shenanigans that we see today. “The whole thing is like the emperor’s new clothes,” said Mark Ellis, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project and an independent expert witness who testifies before state utility commissions. In a recent report, Ellis provided evidence that unwarranted rate increases cost customers $50 billion per year, or about $300 for every U.S. household. “Many people know what’s going on is wrong,” he said, “but they’re all playing along because they’re afraid to call it out.” In his past life, Ellis was the chief economist at Sempra Energy, a consultant with McKinsey, an analyst for ExxonMobil, and an engineer for SoCal Edison. At times, he feels like the little boy in Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale who says aloud what others know but won’t admit. Regulators set electricity rates through a process known as cost-of-service regulation. The ratemaking process, in theory, is a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, public utility commissions that review utilities’ requests have the goal of ensuring that any rate increases are just and reasonable. On the other, they are pressured to set rates high enough so utilities can cover operating costs, maintenance, and expansion projects. The rate charged for electricity is supposed to equal operating costs, the cost of the capital investment, and a “just and reasonable” profit; in sum, this is known as the rate of return. All shareholder-owned companies finance their capital expenditures through a blend of debt and equity; IOUs are no different. Calculating a utility’s cost of debt is relatively straightforward, but its cost of equity, which is not directly observable, must be estimated. This becomes a key variable, and the way that additional capital expenditures can translate into higher profits. Even in the context of needing massive upgrades to decarbonize and meet expanding demand, IOUs are overinvesting, typically in the kinds of activities that don’t benefit consumers or the environment, but instead juice returns. The Supreme Court has long upheld that rate of return should equal the “cost of capital,” as determined by financial markets. Yet any cursory look at the stock prices of major IOUs shows that something is wrong. These staid, low-risk companies that are supposed to be earning tightly regulated profits are actually some of the most dazzling gainers on Wall Street. An RMI report earlier this year found that the top 20 IOUs were trading at an 81 percent premium, because their return on equity was far higher than their cost of equity. The canyon of information asymmetry between public utility commissions and the utilities they regulate has given the latter carte blanche to squeeze ratepayers. Four consulting firms, Ellis says, scour the country to testify in 90 percent of all commission rate cases, using economic models to estimate rates of return that are not used in any other area of finance. Ellis acknowledges that the legal standard “doesn’t necessarily say what model to use,” but in his paper, he explains that the models IOUs use seem to be a means to an end. For example, many consultants use an “expected earnings” analysis that arrives at a rate of return based primarily on future forecasts that the company expects to receive, a totally circular analysis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission banned the expected earnings model from use in federal hearings in 2022, but it continues to be used at the state level. Whenever ratepayer advocates use their own witnesses and their own economic models, they come up with wildly different figures for what the rate of return should be. They are so different, in fact, that most public utility commissions wind up throwing those numbers out, so committed are they to utility industry dogma. Herein lies the fundamental ratemaking dilemma: Public utility commissions have seldom acted as a fiscal boundary to minimize operating costs. In fact, it’s just the opposite. There are signs that policymakers are beginning to get fed up with the continued burdening of the public with higher costs, without improvements to grid reliability that might justify them. This past year, lawmakers in six states introduced measures to limit utilities’ return on equity, the key variable that is overestimated to give utilities excess profits. Legislation in New York and Rhode Island seeks to cap return on equity at 4 percent, while legislators in Massachusetts and New Jersey have proposed new regulatory guidance that would require public utility commissions to minimize return on equity. To keep rates just and reasonable, enhance reliability, and accelerate the energy transition, Ellis launched MarketClear Utility Capital with the goal of delivering attractive returns on utility assets without shifting unnecessary costs onto ratepayers. In conjunction, he has proposed a new investment model for regulated utilities: competitive direct equity (CDE). IOUs generate roughly $2 in shareholder value for every dollar they invest in infrastructure. CDE would eliminate this “capital bias,” which is the driving force behind utility overinvestment. The idea is to establish a market for equity capital that links financial incentives to regulatory outcomes and affordability by replacing “the current system of regulators setting utility returns with actual market competition for utility equity investment,” Ellis wrote in a Real Clear Energy article he co-authored in October. “Under CDE, utilities would earn only their actual market-based cost of capital, removing the reward for excess spending,” he continued. “With capital bias eliminated, regulators could implement meaningful performance-based incentives that are better aligned with the public interest.” WHEN PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS TAKE the rare step of striving to keep rates just and reasonable, they risk their careers. According to the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI), IOUs “often use donations to charitable organizations as a means to encourage organizations to support their political agenda.” Avangrid, which owns electric and gas utilities in Connecticut, has been especially combative toward the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). In 2023, several charitable organizations receiving donations from the Avangrid Foundation called on PURA to “moderate” a draft decision in which regulators rejected a rate hike requested by the company’s Connecticut-based subsidiary, United Illuminating. PURA upheld the decision. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Allegations lodged against Avangrid President and CEO Pedro Azagra Blázquez suggest he made “thinly veiled” efforts to pressure PURA to play ball. In a letter first obtained by CT Mirror, PURA General Counsel Scott Muska accused Azagra Blázquez of implying that the company would reduce its investment in the state if commissioners continued to hand down “adverse rulings.” Muska also alleged that Azagra Blázquez had offered opportunities for “international exposure” to then-PURA Chair Marissa P. Gillett in exchange for her support. (The Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola is Avangrid’s parent company.) Gillett resigned from her post this past fall following intense backlash—particularly by Avangrid—over her efforts to boost cost savings and modernize Connecticut’s approach to ratemaking through performance-based regulation (PBR), which despite its flaws, is premised on realigning utilities’ incentive structure with the public interest. Under Gillett’s leadership, PURA reined in IOU profit margins, advanced its Equitable Modern Grid initiative, and created the Office of Education, Outreach and Enforcement, “which has become a national model for public engagement and is even being replicated in other states and at the federal level,” she wrote in her resignation letter. Utilities took PURA to the state Supreme Court five times during her tenure, all of them ending in PURA victories. Other lawsuits remain active. The pushback on Gillett’s attempts at reform was a constant, including public records requests designed to embarrass her and her team. Opponents claimed that Gillett sought to restrict access to staff from other members of the commission, and one state lawmaker threatened impeachment proceedings and suggested that Gillett lied under oath. The series of episodes “exacted a real emotional toll both for me personally, as well as my family, and for my team,” Gillett wrote in her letter. “I did not make this decision lightly, but there is only so much that one individual can reasonably endure, or ask of their family, while doing their best to serve our state.” Meanwhile, the lucrative nature of the modern utility industry has drawn in a troubling yet familiar face: private equity. The core incentive of the IOU financial model ties profit to capital spending. Private equity ownership turbocharges this incentive. In theory, a private equity owner could generate multiplicative returns by piling on debt and accelerating a utility’s capital deployment. Utilities also enjoy predictable cash flows and guaranteed cost recovery. That bodes well for BlackRock and Blackstone, which have been pursuing utility acquisitions to cash in on the AI data center boom. In October, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission met to approve BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ acquisition of ALLETE, the parent company of Minnesota Power. Previously, Ellis had testified before this commission, arguing that the transaction “proves, unequivocally, that Minnesota Power’s authorized rate of return is excessive, and that excessive [rates of return] are the key motivation for the transaction and the root cause of the forecast unprecedented rate increases.” But a settlement between ALLETE and the Minnesota Department of Commerce, endorsing the sale, made the October proceeding in St. Paul all but a formality. When I attended the hearing, a fellow journalist was approached by an attorney for the buyers, Dan Lipschultz. He used to be on the commission, revealing a popular tactic for industry: hiring former regulators to influence their ex-colleagues. During deliberations, commissioners assured critics that they had the authority to hold the buyers accountable if anything untoward happened. “I really became convinced … when I realized that the goal here was to grow this Minnesota company,” said Commissioner John Tuma, who was initially a skeptic of the deal. He cited organized labor’s support; it had already been reported that Lipschultz ghostwrote a comment letter from the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters and International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49. Tuma also cited another benefit from the BlackRock purchase: the possibility of a new utility owner willing to make investments being attractive to data centers. In the end, the vote was unanimous in support of the acquisition. As part of the $6.2 billion deal, Global Infrastructure Partners made several commitments, including a one-year moratorium on rate increases and a modest reduction to its authorized return on equity. But critics argue the concessions are not enough to prevent excessive rate increases over the long term. “Even with concessions made, the deal is still a bad deal for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, an expert witness in the case, said at the time. THE INABILITY OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS to keep costs down for customers sits squarely at the center of the affordability crisis. It also reflects the failure of technocratic liberalization, which as Sevier observed in an October report he co-authored, “has failed at its core promise of increasing competition, without lowering costs for working people, stabilizing costs, making services more reliable, increasing energy conservation, reducing private utility opposition to rooftop solar, and slowing upward wealth redistribution.” If regulatory capture is to blame, what might a viable alternative look like? “Public power is the most sensible solution to answer these big questions,” Sevier told the Prospect. This idea has appealed to a growing number of community organizers across the country who contend that cutting shareholders out of the equation would free up additional resources to strengthen the grid, enhance reliability, ease ratepayers’ debt burdens, and expand benefits for workers. There are existing models going back centuries that have delivered cheaper power and maintained energy democracy with public input. “We’re part of a national movement … something that gets lost a little bit when you’re working at a local level,” Jessica Cook, an organizer with Milwaukee DSA’s Power to the People campaign, told the Prospect. Cook is also legislative assistant to Alderperson Alex Brower, who represents the city’s Third District. The first socialist to win a Milwaukee Common Council seat in 77 years, Brower campaigned on replacing We Energies, an investor-owned electric and gas utility that serves more than two million Wisconsinites. Greater Milwaukee is its largest service area. “We Energies acts like they own this town,” Brower said in an interview with the Prospect. “People are fed up, and they’ve realized the profit motive driving We Energies is to blame.” In the last three years, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved two consecutive rate increases: an 8.8 percent base-rate increase, effective January 2023, and a cumulative increase of 12.38 percent for 2025 and 2026. “People are already hurting,” Alexander Hagler, a 35-year-old Milwaukee resident and owner of Kuumba Juice & Coffee, told the Prospect. “Electricity is like the air we breathe,” he added, describing it as one of the “many different resources in our society that we need to bring under the control of the people.” Power to the People, which started in Milwaukee three years ago, has called on the city to replace We Energies with a municipal or cooperative utility, which would require a majority vote from the Milwaukee Common Council. Organizers have proposed funding the acquisition through tax-exempt municipal bonds, lowering the cost of capital without jeopardizing the city’s credit rating so long as a dedicated utility enterprise fund is established. The campaign runs weekly canvasses and phone banks, speaking directly to ratepayers’ frustration and offering an established alternative. “People are looking for something,” said Audra Hale, an organizer with Power to the People and at-large executive committee member at Milwaukee DSA. The day before we spoke, Hale and other canvassers collected over 300 signatures for the campaign’s petition to replace We Energies at a local No Kings Day protest. Nearly 14,000 people have now signed that petition, which Brower will eventually submit to the Common Council. “We’re trying to convince my colleagues that this is a good idea,” Brower said, adding that Power to the People has been “doubling down” on canvassing in districts whose alderpersons “can be moved.” To date, no other alderpersons have come out to publicly support the campaign. With an election coming up in 2026, Milwaukee DSA is trying to change that by endorsing candidates who support Power to the People and running challengers against those who do not. During a canvass in late October, volunteers split into two groups to collect signatures in District 6. I tagged along with the second group; we stopped at four different laundromats. Among the volunteers was Andy Barbour, co-chair of Milwaukee DSA. He spoke with a resident who, having been a We Energies employee, declined to sign the petition due to concerns over their pension. But the message seemed to stick; Barbour was pleasantly surprised when that same resident convinced a friend to sign on. At one point, another resident who added her name to the petition claimed that We Energies had shut off her electricity after she missed a payment. “They suck … We’ve got to come together,” she said. By 3 p.m., canvassers had collected close to 60 signatures. Despite the “success rate” of its canvasses, Barbour said Power to the People will need to “prepare for the fights ahead, because we know they are coming.” UTILITIES HAVE SPENT BIG TO PREVENT public power campaigns from gaining traction in communities across the country. “Utilities are trying to make it as difficult as possible for cities to liberate themselves from corporations who do not care about actually delivering affordable service [and] would rather enrich themselves to increase returns for their shareholders,” said Shelby Green, a research and communications manager at EPI. And they have been successful. As Maine Public reported, the parent companies of Central Maine Power and Versant Power spent tens of millions of dollars to defeat public power at the ballot box in 2023. Avangrid, which also owns Central Maine Power, contributed more than $18 million to the paradoxically named utility front group Maine Affordable Energy, while Maine Energy Progress received approximately $15 million from Enmax, the parent company of Versant Power. Our Power, the advocacy group behind the municipalization effort, only raised about $236,000. Yet as electric rates skyrocket, this spending may mean nothing to angry voters. In Georgia, an industry front group called Power for Tomorrow spent almost $200,000 this year around the Georgia Public Service Commission race, an off-year special election where two Republican incumbents who had approved six rate increases over a two-year period were running for re-election. Democrats Alicia M. Johnson and Peter Hubbard campaigned on affordability and reliability, laying the blame for recent rate increases on excessive profit margins and the slow pace of decarbonization. Despite the spending against them, they became the first Democrats in Georgia to win a nonfederal statewide election in nearly 20 years, smoking the Republican incumbents by 26 points. “Affordability is front and center in voters’ minds, and today they overwhelmingly said they’re tired of subsidizing corporate interests at the expense of their families,” Hubbard said on election night. With affordability front and center, the public power movement has an opportunity to reclaim the narrative around public power. Next year, Ann Arbor for Public Power will submit a ballot proposal asking voters to create a consumer-owned utility that would replace DTE Energy, an electric and gas utility holding company serving more than three million customers across southeastern Michigan. Meanwhile, public power organizers in Clearwater, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona, pressed local officials to rigorously consider municipalization after the cities had commissioned feasibility studies. In September, the Clearwater City Council authorized an appraisal process to further evaluate the viability of a consumer-owned utility. (We Stand for Energy, a utility front group backed by the Edison Electric Institute, promptly blasted the idea in a social media ad campaign.) “The electricity system connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric,” Sevier said. “We have to rebuild trust and to demonstrate that our infrastructure can serve a public good, not a private profit.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: Are Bitcoin ETF inflows finally back after IBIT ETF’s 7% jump?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=550923
Time Published: 2025-12-03T09:00:38Z

Is Bitcoin’s ‘Santa rally’ back, or will Japan spoil the party? Bitcoin’s [BTC] price jumped over 8% to over $93K in the past 24 hours, at press time, following renewed ETF inflows led by BlackRock. On the 2nd of December, BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF (IBIT) netted $120 million in Daily Net Inflow, marking a 7% surge. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also drew institutional inflows of $22 million and $7.4 million, respectively. However, ARK Invest’s ARKB bled out about $91 million, bringing the total Daily Net Inflows to $58.5 million. Source: SoSo Value Even so, the performance on the 2nd of December marked the fifth consecutive day of net inflows, which has stabilized the BTC price above $80,000. But do the positive inflows signal the return of the ‘Santa rally’? For his part, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas viewed the IBIT-induced price recovery as the “Vanguard effect.” The world’s second-largest $11 trillion asset manager lifted the crypto ban on the 2nd of December, allowing over 50 million users to trade crypto ETFs, including IBIT. Balchunas said that the IBIT’s renewed inflow was likely driven by Vanguard clients. He added, “Also $1B in IBIT volume in first 30min of trading. I knew those Vanguardians had a little degen in them, even some of the most conservative investors like to add a little hot sauce to their portfolio.” According to him, Vanguard saved BTC from the Q4 plunge. For Coinbase analysts, however, the easing macro front was juicing up liquidity and risk assets. “With quantitative tightening ending, the Fed is back in the bond market, and the drain of cash from markets may be behind us. That’s usually good for risk-on assets like crypto.” The analysts highlighted that the current macro landscape favors ‘breakout trades over knife catching.’ Notably, the extended BTC drop in the past few weeks cleared key supports, including the $98K-$100K which was a significant cluster as a cost basis for most bulls. For Coinbase analysts, this was the next key level to watch. Source: Coinbase/Glassnode Put differently, reclaiming $98K-$100K could attract more demand or cap BTC recovery if most bulls opt to break even and exit positions at the level. Swissblock analytics also echoed the Coinbase outlook. It projected a potential ‘tactical recovery’ from mid-December, citing past liquidity capitulation events that were followed by a strong rebound after 1–3 weeks. Source: Swissblock Despite the optimism, the risk of the Yen carry trade unwinding still appears likely, with an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point rate increase by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its meeting set for the 19th of December.

The anchor book allotment for the highly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) of e-commerce platform Meesho ignited controversy after higher anchor allocation to SBI Mutual Fund. Meesho’s IPO advisors prioritised investors who were keen on a long-term partnership with the e-commerce firm, people in the know told NDTV Profit. With this in mind SBI MF secure approximately 25% of the total anchor book portion which was viewed as disproportionately large by other Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). Meesho did not provide an official comment. Meesho, on Tuesday said it has garnered a little over Rs 2,439 crore from anchor investors, including SBI Mutual Fund, Fidelity Funds, and BlackRock, ahead of its IPO opening for subscription. The anchor book witnessed demand of over Rs 80,000 crore, translating into nearly 30 times oversubscription. The anchor book saw participation from 60 investors, including major domestic institutional investors and leading global names such as the Government of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website. On the domestic front, SBI Mutual Fund (MF), UTI MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Axis MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Bandhan MF, and HSBC MF, among others, have been allotted shares. As per the circular, the company has allocated 21.97 crore equity shares at Rs 111 apiece, raising a total of Rs 2,439.5 crore. The IPO will comprise a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,250 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of 10.55 crore shares valued at Rs 1,171 crore at the upper band, taking the total issue size to Rs 5,421 crore.

Retail investors led the demand with 3.85 times subscription, followed by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) support at 2.12 times and non-institutional investors (NIIs) at 1.80 times. Meesho on Tuesday raised ₹2,439.54 crore from anchor investors, including SBI Mutual Fund, Tiger Global, ADIA, GIC, BlackRock, GIC, Fidelity, WCM investment, Goldman Sachs and Dragoneer. The e-commerce firm aims to raise ₹5,421 crore through the IPO, which concludes on December 5. It has fixed a price band of ₹105-111 per share, valuing the company at ₹50,096 crore ($5.6 billion) at the upper end. The IPO comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹4,250 crore, and an OFS of 10.55 crore shares valued at ₹1,171 crore at the upper band. The company will use the proceeds for investment in cloud infrastructure, marketing and brand initiatives, as well as funding inorganic growth through acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes. Meesho IPO: Key things to know and should you subscribe? Most analysts acknowledged the company’s strong position in the value-e-commerce segment, deep penetration in Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets, and its asset-light marketplace model, which has helped it scale rapidly. They noted that Meesho’s improving unit economics and declining losses make it a promising long-term growth story. However, several brokerages also highlight risks such as intense competition, the company’s still-evolving path to profitability, and the need to sustain growth without heavy discounting. Brokerages have largely issued a “subscribe for long term” stance rather than an aggressive “subscribe” for listing gains. Overall, brokerages see potential but recommend that investors approach the issue with realistic expectations and a long-term horizon. Two other mainboard IPOs, which opened today, Aequs and Vidya Wires, also witnessed healthy first-day subscription, largely fueled by retail buyers. The Aequs IPO drew 3.42 times subscription on its opening day, driven largely by strong retail interest at 11.46 times. Non-institutional investors subscribed 3.40 times, while QIB participation remained modest at 0.66 times. The employee quota was subscribed 6.72 times. The contract manufacturing firm Aequs launched its ₹922-crore IPO at a price of ₹118-124. It comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹670 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.03 crore shares valued at ₹252 crore by promoters and existing investors. Ahead of the IPO, it collected ₹414 crore from anchor investors. Vidya Wires’ IPO recorded 2.89 times overall subscription, with strong interest from retail investors at 4.02 times and NIIs at 3.42 times, while QIB participation remained subdued at 0.47 times. The ₹300-crore IPO of Vidya Wires comprised of fresh issue of shares worth ₹274 crore and OFS of 50.01 lakh shares valued at ₹26 crore, at a price band of ₹48-52 per share. The company raised ₹90 crore from anchor investors. Published on December 3, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Thames Water debt pile rises further despite return to profit

The UK's largest supplier reveals a surge in complaints about rising bills but says its performance, such as in preventing sewage spills, has improved. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 December 2025 07:33, UK Cash-strapped Thames Water has revealed a further rise in its debt pile while recording a return to profit on the back of inflation-busting hikes to bills. The UK's largest supplier said the 31% rise to customer bills since April had allowed it to increase capital investment by 22% to £1.3bn amid demands it improve performance in preventing sewage spills and stopping leaks. Thames Water said it recorded a 20% drop in pollution incidents over the six months to the end of September, and leakage performance was holding steady despite the "extremely dry summer". Money latest: How much is a fair restaurant tip? While waste complaints dipped by 11%, according to the company, there was a 42% surge in the number of customers complaining about the hike to bills. Thames Water revenue rose 42% on the same period last year to £1.9bn, helping a return to profit after tax of £328m on the back of a £190m loss during April-September 2024. Major airport increasing drop-off charge | Money blog Energy grid £28bn upgrade to add £108 to household bills Construction activity shrank 'at fastest pace since COVID' ahead of budget The company said profitability was damaged by higher debt serving costs. Its debt pile was recorded at £17.6bn - a rise of 5%. The results were released against the backdrop of continuing talks involving the government and regulators over a proposed rescue deal by major Thames Water creditors. Their consortium is known as London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but regulator Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of industry oversight, has been leading scrutiny of London & Valley's operational plan and proposed capital structure. The prospective deal would write off billions of pounds of the company's debt and inject billions in fresh equity, in return for an adjustment in the regulator's approach to future financial penalties. Thames sees the creditors' proposal as the only viable solution. Despite huge hikes to household bills - allowed across England and Wales to bolster aging infrastructure including storm overflows - the company says its financial turnaround has been hampered by record fines for things like sewage leaks and bonuses to retain key staff. Sky News revealed on Tuesday that its remuneration committee will meet next week to decide whether to proceed with nearly £2.5m in retention payments to 21 senior managers.

"This progress has all been achieved as we also manage the recapitalisation of the business. We continue to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led solution that we believe is in the best interests of our customers and the environment. "This in turn will allow the transformation of Thames to continue, a programme that will take at least a decade to complete and will restore the infrastructure and operations of the company."

Title: BlackRock’s top brass says tokenization will bridge crypto and finance

BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management, and operates the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. Former crypto skeptic BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and chief operating officer Rob Goldstein say tokenization will act as a bridge between the crypto industry and traditional finance, doubling down on their support of the sector. In an opinion article penned by Fink and Goldstein and published Monday in The Economist, the pair said that tokenization won’t replace the existing financial system any time soon, but predict it will help merge the two industries. “Think of it instead as a bridge being built from both sides of a river, converging in the middle. On one side stand traditional institutions. On the other are digital-first innovators: stablecoin issuers, fintech’s and public blockchains,” the pair wrote. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Its co-founder and CEO, Fink, was previously a crypto skeptic before he changed his mind. Fink and Goldstein said at first glance, it was hard for them to see the “big idea” because tokenization was tangled up in the crypto boom, which “often looked like speculation.” “But in recent years, traditional finance has seen what was hiding beneath the hype: tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets beyond the listed stocks and bonds that dominate markets today,” they added. BlackRock already has the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, launched in March 2024. However, Fink and Goldstein also stated that tokenization must proceed safely, with appropriate regulations, which requires policymakers and regulators to update the rules to enable traditional and tokenized markets to work together. Related: Plume CEO tips RWA to grow 3-5x in 2026 as it grows past crypto natives Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) followed a similar path for fixed income, connecting dealer markets with public exchanges, allowing investors to trade more efficiently, according to Fink and Goldstein. “And now with spot Bitcoin ETFs, even digital assets are on traditional exchanges. Each of these innovations builds bridges. The same principle applies to tokenization,” they said.

Meesho faces investor backlash over anchor share allocation to SBI Funds, leading to withdrawals from major investment firms.

Title: Meesho IPO: Samir Arora Calls For Regulator Intervention On Fairness Amid Anchor Allotment Row

India’s red-hot IPO market has been jolted by a rare backlash after several major global investors reportedly pulled out of Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book, prompting Helios Capital founder Samir Arora to call for urgent regulatory intervention to make the process “more fair.” Arora criticised the current structure of anchor allocations in high-demand IPOs, describing them as “a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms.” Regulator must intervene to make this process more fair. Right now allocations in hot IPOs are just a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms. pic.twitter.com/IFjGHDD9H3 His comments followed a Bloomberg report that Meesho allocated nearly a quarter of its anchor tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., India’s largest asset manager a move that triggered pushback from other institutional investors. In a clarification posted later, Arora stressed that his criticism was not directed at SBI MF. “They are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early,” he said. The issue, he insisted, lies with funds that inflate orders at the last minute to secure allocations without truly participating in price discovery. “Then what anchor,” he wrote, arguing that many so-called anchors simply “pile on” because the IPO is hot. My tweet is not against SBI MF for they are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early. My point is against all these funds who inflate their orders at the last moment and do not really "anchor" any deal but pile on. Then what anchor.May be one ideaâ¦ https://t.co/FmCBITtB0W Arora floated a potential solution: anchor lists should be finalised and announced 30 days before an IPO opens, ensuring that institutions engage meaningfully in negotiating and setting valuations instead of swooping in based on the momentum of the deal. The current process, he said, encourages opportunistic bidding driven by commissions and size rather than long-term commitment. According to a report by Bloomberg, Meesho’s anchor book faced withdrawals from several prominent investors after the disproportionate allocation to SBI Funds. Those who pulled out included Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon India Life Asset Management, and Nomura Asset Management. Many of these funds, according to the report, had sought allocations similar to SBI Funds and opted out in protest when their expectations were not met. The anchor tranche is a crucial signalling mechanism for market confidence, typically drawing long-only global investors who help set the tone for pricing. Meesho, however, received strong institutional participation in its pre-IPO anchor round, raising Rs 2,440 crore on Tuesday. Marque foreign entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, Government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Schroder Group, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allotted shares.

Melligeri, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Aequs Limited | Photo Credit: TH Aequs, a contract manufacturing firm specialising in consumer durable goods and aerospace parts, on Tuesday said it has garnered ₹414 crore from anchor investors, ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The anchor book saw participation from domestic and global institutional investors, including SBI Mutual Fund (MF), HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Axis MF, Motilal Oswal MF, BlackRock Global Funds, Steadview Capital, and Citigroup, according to a circular uploaded on BSE's website. As per the circular, Aequs has allotted around 3.34 crore equity shares to 33 funds at ₹124 apiece, raising ₹413.92 crore. The initial share sale will open for subscription on December 3 and close on December 5. The price band has been set at ₹118-124 per share for the issue, valuing Aequs at over ₹8,300 crore. The IPO comprises a fresh issue of shares worth ₹670 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.03 crore shares valued at ₹252 crore by promoters and existing investors, taking the total issue size to ₹922 crore. Funds raised from the fresh issue would be used for repaying loans taken by the company and its two subsidiaries -- AeroStructures Manufacturing India and Aequs Consumer Products; purchasing machinery and equipment for the company and AeroStructures; and supporting future growth through potential acquisitions, other strategic initiatives, and for general corporate needs. Last month, Aequs raised around ₹144 crore from SBI Funds Management, DSP India Fund and Think India Opportunities Fund as a part of a pre-IPO funding round. Aequs initially filed confidential draft papers with Sebi in June and secured approval in September to launch the IPO. By opting for the confidential pre-filing route, the company could delay public disclosure of IPO details until later stages, a strategy increasingly adopted by Indian firms seeking flexibility in their IPO planning. Aequs primarily operates in the aerospace segment, but over the years, it has expanded its product portfolio to include consumer electronics, plastics, and consumer durables. Its consumer products include cookware and small home appliances, while its plastics offerings include outdoor toys, figurines, toy vehicles, and components for consumer electronics such as portable computers and smart devices. The company is backed by prominent investors, including Amicus Capital, Amansa Capital, Steadview Capital, Catamaran -- the family office of Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy --, and Sparta Group. Its key clients are Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Collins Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems Inc., Safran, GKN Aerospace, Mubea Aerostructures, Honeywell, Eaton, and Sabca in aerospace, and Hasbro, Spinmaster, Wonderchef, and Tramontina in consumer products. It operates manufacturing facilities across India, France, and the USA. In India, the company runs three manufacturing clusters in Belagavi, Hubballi, and Koppal in Karnataka. Founded by Aravind Melligeri, who has decades of experience in the aerospace sector and was a co-founder of Quest Global Engineering. As per the company, 75 per cent of the issue size has been reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10 per cent for retail investors. The company will make its debut on the stock market on December 10. Published on December 3, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

The Softbank-backed firm Meesho’s IPO remained modest, with the issue subscribed 0.56 times so far on the first day of bidding. Retail investors drove most of the early traction, while institutional participation remained absent in the initial hours. Two other mainboard IPOs, which opened today, Aequs and Vidya Wires were fully subscribed by mid-day. “We believe Aequs Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in a one of India’s most advanced and fully integrated aerospace precision-manufacturing platforms. We think with a unique position as the only Indian manufacturer operating from a single SEZ with end to end aerospace capabilities that is spanning machining, forging, surface treatment and assembly, company offers high entry-barrier exposure to a globally outsourced industry. We also think company’s global manufacturing footprint across India, the U.S. and France enhances customer proximity and collaboration, enabling it to win and retain long-term contracts with global OEMs such as Airbus, Boeing, Safran Collins and Spirit AeroSystems, many of whom have relationships exceeding 15 years. By looking at the financials, While the company reported muted financial performance the revenue from operations growth of 18.8% in FY24 followed by a 4.2% decline in FY25, with losses driven largely by a slowdown in the consumer division and strategic business transitions. While the core aerospace segment continues to demonstrate strong and structural momentum. On valuation parse at the upper price band of Rs. 124/-, the issue is asking for a Market cap of Rs. 8316/- cr. Based on FY2026 annualised earning company is asking for price to book value of 5.7x which seems reasonable compare to its listed peer trading at an average of ~10x. Given the strong customer stickiness, a diversified portfolio and JVs with global leaders like Magellan Aerospace, Aubert & Duval and Tramontina, we believe Aequs is well-positioned to capture the rising outsourcing trend in aerospace precision components. Its ability to leverage aerospace capabilities into high-volume consumer products further strengthens utilisation and margins. Hence, considering its strong competitive moat, global customer base, and alignment with the rising aerospace manufacturing opportunity in India, we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the Aequs Ltd IPO for a long-term perspective.” Contrary to manufacturing, services in the private sector showed an improvement in November, a survey by S&P Global, released on Wednesday, showed.

Meanwhile he provided a hint pointing to Kevin Hassett as the “potential” next Federal Reserve chair during a White House event Meanwhile, Switzerland signalled that it may need to adjust to ongoing US tariffs despite securing parity with the EU in a recent tariff deal. SECO chief Helene Budliger Artieda noted that a return to earlier tariff levels appears unlikely in the near term. On the domestic front The government clarified that it is not considering a proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in public sector banks to 49% from the current 20%. At present, the FDI cap stands at 20% for PSBs and 74% for private banks, with automatic approval permitted up to 49% and the government route required beyond that. Separately, the Cabinet Secretariat has asked state governments to flag any pending issues they face with central government departments in connection with its ongoing deregulation exercise, multiple senior government officials said, ahead of a meeting of chief secretaries later this month to review the reforms. In the commodities segment, India’s palm oil imports inched up 4.6% month-on-month in November to 630,000 metric tons, as refiners capitalised on lower prices and trimmed purchases of costlier soyoil and sunflower oil. Energy flows saw a sharp adjustment as India’s imports of Russian crude declined following stricter US sanctions implemented on November 21. While November arrivals averaged 1.8 million bpd—boosted by pre-sanction stocking—post-deadline shipments dropped to 1.27 million bpd. December imports are projected at around 1.0 million bpd, with a potential temporary dip toward 800,000 bpd before stabilising. On the macro outlook, the OECD maintained its FY26 growth forecast for India at 6.7%, supported by monetary easing and GST reforms, and kept the FY27 projection unchanged at 6.2%. It noted that a successful rollback of US tariffs could lift confidence and boost manufacturing exports, while elevated oil prices remain a key downside risk for inflation and consumption. Meanwhile, under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) scheme, just over one-third of the FY26 allocation—₹56,826 crore—has been released for 4,106 approved projects as of November 27. Uttar Pradesh leads with 482 projects worth ₹8,465 crore, followed by Maharashtra (331) and Odisha (288), with the top 10 states accounting for about 65% of total sanctioned projects. Asian market Asia market opened higher today followed by the US market as bullish bets on tech resumed amid rising expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cryptocurrency rally.

Title: Marvell Rallies After Upbeat CEO Remarks, Celestial AI Deal

(Bloomberg) -- Marvell Technology Inc. rallied in late trading after reassuring investors that its custom chip-design unit is winning repeat orders, signaling continued growth as the company benefits from runaway spending on AI computing. On a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Marvell said it’s now more bullish about revenue growth next year and predicted that custom chip sales will increase 20%. Large customers have renewed orders, and Marvell said there won’t be a repeat of previous “air pockets,” when sales in that unit have declined. The company also announced plans to acquire startup Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion, a move it said would bolster the artificial intelligence push. On the call, Chief Executive Officer Matt Murphy indicated that Marvell revenue could reach $10 billion in the next fiscal year, well above the $9.47 billion predicted by analysts. “We’re very optimistic about our outlook over the next couple of years,” he said. The remarks sent the shares up more than 15% in late trading, reversing earlier declines. The stock had been down 16% this year through Tuesday’s close. Marvell has tried to position itself to benefit from the AI spending boom — with mixed success. Though it’s helping cloud-computing companies like Amazon.com Inc. design custom chips to handle AI, those products aren’t as widespread as Nvidia Corp. processors. The latest commentary suggests that Marvell is making some headway. On the call, the company said it expected “accelerated growth” in its custom chip business. Recent customer wins include an “emerging hyperscaler” — an industry term that describes a large data-center operator. Marvell also forecast revenue of roughly $2.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which runs through January, in line with the average Wall Street projection. Adjusted gross margin will be about 59% in the period, the company said, compared with an average prediction of 59.5%. Marvell forecast earnings of 79 cents a share, matching the estimate. In the Celestial AI deal, Marvell is offering $1 billion in cash and stock valued at $2.25 billion, according to a separate statement. Under the agreement, Celestial AI investors stand to be paid as much as $2.25 billion in additional Marvell shares if the business hits certain revenue targets. Celestial AI, a Santa Clara, California-based startup founded in 2020, offers a technology called photonic fabric that connects components within AI infrastructure. It relies on light to more efficiently move data, helping artificial intelligence systems run more quickly. The startup, which completed a $255 million funding round in August, was backed by Fidelity Management & Research Co., BlackRock Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan also was an investor, and he joined the company’s board earlier this year. The takeover is slated to close in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The additional payouts begin to take effect if Celestial AI reaches cumulative revenue of at least $500 million by the end of Marvell’s fiscal 2029. The full amount will be paid if the cumulative revenue tops $2 billion by that point. The Information previously reported that Marvell was in talks to acquire Celestial AI.

More Info The world’s biggest private equity groups are investing in infrastructure assets of the national oil companies of the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) opened their pipeline networks to foreign capital. Private equity giants are now seeking a slice of the infrastructure assets of the international majors in deals that would give Big Oil funds to reinvest in oil and gas production. These days, amid lower oil prices and continued reluctance of public-market investors despite the dramatic shift in the ESG narrative, private equity money could be an opportunity for the top Western majors to raise cash by selling parts of their pipeline and storage assets. The infrastructure deals in the oil and gas sector began from the Middle East, but these could spread to the international majors, which need capital to sustain dividends and buybacks at $60 oil and have enough to invest in boosting oil and gas production. Investors Eye Big Oil’s Infrastructure Assets Investors have recently urged top executives from ExxonMobil, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni to consider selling stakes in pipeline and storage assets to private equity groups in what would be a new way for Big Oil to monetize their infrastructure assets and one that doesn’t involve equity-market investors. Ahead of ADIPEC, one of the energy industry’s top gatherings, private equity teams sat down at a closed-door meeting with Exxon, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni and told their executives that they could offload more of their infrastructure assets, the Financial Times reports. “You guys need to rethink how you think about capital,” one participant at the meeting told the majors, the FT says. Right now, private equity giants are more inclined to invest in Big Oil than the equity markets that are “not as receptive” to the oil and gas industry, the participant told FT. Related: U.S. Sanctions Force Serbia's Only Refinery to Shut Down “Take the cheap capital and reinvest it in your core business,” the person added, referring to Big Oil’s opportunities to attract funds from the infrastructure arms of the biggest investment firms. Some deals have been made this year. For example, Apollo-managed funds in March signed a deal with BP to invest about $1 billion to purchase a 25% non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines (TANAP) Ltd, the BP subsidiary that holds BP’s 12% interest in TANAP, owner and operator of the pipeline that carries natural gas from Azerbaijan across Turkey. While the deal enables BP to monetise its interest in TANAP, BP will remain the controlling shareholder of BP TANAP and retain a long-term commercial and strategic interest, including governance rights, in the pipeline - a vital part of the gas value chain for the BP-operated Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan. Prior to that, Apollo and BP signed an agreement for Apollo to buy a non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, which holds a 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG (TAP) in a transaction valued at about $1 billion. “BP and Apollo continue to explore opportunities for further cooperation, including in infrastructure, gas and low carbon energy assets,” the UK-based supermajor said in March 2025, just as it had unveiled its strategic reset to shift focus back to oil and gas. This summer, Shell completed the sale of its 16.125% interest in the company owning the Colonial Pipeline in the U.S. to Colossus AcquireCo LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners. Other supermajors have yet to announce major deals in the trend that the Middle East’s national oil companies kicked off. Investors Flock to Middle East Energy Infrastructure As early as in 2020, Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC struck a $20.7-billion deal with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield, among other investors, to sell a 49% stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets LLC. This year, global investment firm KKR bought a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets. KKR was part of the first-ever energy infrastructure deal for a Middle Eastern NOC when it bought in 2019 a minority stake in ADNOC’s oil pipelines business. The 2019 acquisition of 40% in ADNOC Oil Pipelines by KKR and BlackRock was the first-ever investment of foreign asset managers in infrastructure of a state-owned energy firm in the Gulf. Last year, KKR and BlackRock sold the 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines to Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment manager Lunate. Saudi Arabia is also looking for opportunities to monetize Aramco’s infrastructure with deals with global funds. Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is a key part of Aramco’s plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. Infrastructure deals have flourished in the Middle East in recent months. Last year, Bapco Energies of Bahrain sold to a BlackRock fund a minority ownership stake in the Saudi Bahrain Pipeline Company (SBPC). Kuwait’s state firm Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is looking to raise up to $7 billion from leasing part of its pipeline network in a transaction that would be similar to Aramco’s deal, Bloomberg reported in September. The trend of global infrastructure funds buying into energy infrastructure started in the Middle East but is already expanding to Big Oil, as evidenced in the recent Shell and BP pipeline deals. Private equity money would be a win-win for the participants in transactions—the international majors will get capital outside of their traditional (and drying) public-markets base, while infrastructure funds will get long-term reliable returns on their investment.

Cheyenne, Wyoming-based Kraken said the transaction for the provider of services bridging equities to decentralized finance would "accelerate the global adoption of xStocks"—securities that already trade on markets made available on blockchains. Kraken this year has been working with Backed to offer tokenized stocks and ETFs to its clients using crypto networks like Ethereum and Solana. Tokenization refers to the process of taking real-world assets and representing them on-chain using digital assets. "Integrating Backed into Kraken strengthens the core architecture required for open and programmable capital markets," Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said in a statement. "Unifying issuance, trading and settlement under one framework ensures the infrastructure for tokenized assets remains transparent, reliable and globally accessible. This is foundational work for the next era of market structure." Kraken would not reveal the size of the transaction to Decrypt. The company has made a number of acquisitions this year as it prepares for a public offering. In September, the exchange bought proprietary trading platform Breakout for an undisclosed amount, and earlier this year snapped up futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. Sethi has previously said that "traditional markets run on post-WWII, 1950s banking systems," and the company was aiming to become an "institutional-grade trading platform where any asset can be traded, anytime." He added on Tuesday that the latest acquisition was "bigger than giving people exposure to U.S. equities, it's about redefining what it means to own assets in the digital era." Traditional finance firms' interest in tokenization has risen in recent years. BlackRock boss Larry Fink has frequently spoken about how it will change capital markets and now has a tokenized money-market fund. And Wall Street giant Franklin Templeton has been tokenizing assets on a number of blockchains for years.

Title: IBIT Among Most-Traded ETFs as Bitcoin Surges; Mining Stocks Sink

Bitcoin BTC$92,162.24 bounced back on Tuesday, gaining about 6% over the last 24 hours after a sharp sell-off to start the week. The rebound helped drive heavy activity in crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which was among the most-traded ETFs in the U.S. for the day. IBIT saw around $3.7 billion in trading volume Tuesday, surpassing the S&P 500 ETF from Vanguard (VOO), which recorded $3.28 billion, according to data from Barchart. That puts BlackRock’s bitcoin fund in rare company, alongside some of the most liquid and widely held ETFs in the market. The spike in volume may be tied to bitcoin’s price recovery, but it also came a day after Vanguard, which had long been resistant to crypto, said it would begin allowing bitcoin ETFs and crypto mutual funds to trade on its brokerage platform. BlackRock’s bitcoin funds have quickly become a cornerstone of the firm’s product lineup, despite launching less than two years ago. IBIT alone now holds $66.3 billion in net assets and has become the firm’s top revenue-generating ETF. That’s notable considering BlackRock manages over 1,400 ETFs and has $13.4 trillion in total assets under management. Cryptos across the board also traded higher on Tuesday, with ether ETH$3,141.43, XRP and DOGE$0.1486 all gaining around 7% over the past 24 hours. Cardano’s native token, ADA, led the race with 14%. Chainlink’s token, LINK, was also 11% higher after Grayscale debuted a new ETF tied to the token on NYSE Arca on Tuesday. The bounce in bitcoin prices Tuesday rippled through crypto-related stocks. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), which holds more than 174,000 BTC on its balance sheet, rose 6%. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), which offers crypto services alongside stocks, gained 2%. Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, climbed 5%, and Circle (CRLC), the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, added 4%. Coinbase (COIN) moved in the opposite direction. Its shares fell 5% after a group of shareholders filed a lawsuit Monday accusing company executives of engaging in a yearslong scheme to unload billions of dollars in stock while misleading investors. The suit claims insiders took advantage of inflated valuations following Coinbase’s 2021 public listing to cash out at the expense of long-term shareholders. The picture in bitcoin mining stocks looked less rosy. Despite the broader crypto market’s rebound, most miners traded in the red on Tuesday. Shares of Iren (IREN) led the declines with a 15% drop, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), which fell 10%, and TeraWulf (WULF), down 7%.

Title: The World’s Second Biggest Bank Recommends Up To 4% Bitcoin Allocation In Portfolios
URL: https://zycrypto.com/the-worlds-second-biggest-bank-recommends-up-to-4-bitcoin-allocation-in-portfolios/
Time Published: 2025-12-02T21:06:05Z

Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the world by market cap, has become the latest Wall Street titan to join the crypto rush. The bank says wealth clients should consider allocating up to 4% of their portfolios to crypto. Beginning Jan. 5, 2026, the bank’s wealth management advisors will be allowed to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to cryptocurrencies through the Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms, according to a report from Yahoo Finance. Bank of America’s chief investment office will also begin coverage of four Bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, said in a statement. “The lower end of this range may be more appropriate for those with a conservative risk profile, while the higher end may suit investors with greater tolerance for overall portfolio risk,” Hyzy added. The development reverses Bank of America’s prior policy, which barred advisers from endorsing crypto unless a client explicitly requested access. That restriction effectively sidelined over 15,000 advisers during a period when institutional interest in regulated digital asset products was soaring. It comes a day after Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset management company, approved crypto ETF trading for its clients, marking a U-turn from its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. For many in the crypto industry, that major financial institutions such as Bank of America and Vanguard allow their clients to dabble in crypto is a sign of how far the nascent asset class has come since the days when certain banking execs labeled it a “fraud.” Notably, BlackRock was the first renowned Wall Street institution to advise interested investors to allocate as much as 2% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Back in June, asset management firm Fidelity also backed a 2% to 5% Bitcoin allocation, which was small enough to minimize the risk of a BTC crash, but big enough to enjoy any upside from the asset’s inflationary hedge. Morgan Stanley then issued a 2%–4% recommendation for “opportunistic portfolios” in October.

Title: You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitocin treasury companies continue to accumulate a significant amount of BTC despite current market conditions and now control around 5% of the total BTC supply. These companies are led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Metaplanet, which have recently raised fresh capital to buy the dip. Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the top 100 public Bitcoin treasury companies currently hold 1,058,929 BTC, while all public companies combined hold 1,061,697. Notably, Strategy is the largest public Bitcoin holder with 650,000 BTC. Michael Saylor’s company yesterday announced another 130 BTC purchase for $11.7 million. Meanwhile, the second-largest Bitcoin treasury company is BTC miner MARA holdings, which holds 53,250 BTC. Tether-backed Twenty One Capital, Metaplanet, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company complete the top 5, with 43,514, 30,823, and 30,021 BTC, respectively. Meanwhile, companies like Coinbase, Bullish, and Trump Media are among the top 10 largest BTC treasury companies. It is worth noting that these public companies account for only a part of the Bitcoin treasuries. Further data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that there is currently 4 million BTC in treasuries as a whole, including the coins held by governments, private companies, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and ETFs. BlackRock is currently the second-largest Bitcoin holder, only behind Satoshi Nakamoto. Strategy is third on the list, while Binance and the U.S. government complete the top 5, with BTC holdings of 628,868 and 323,588, respectively. The 4 million BTC held by these treasury companies as a group accounts for 19% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have raised new capital amid the recent crash to buy more BTC. Saylor’s company recently raised $836 million from its STRE offering, which it used to buy 8,178 BTC. Meanwhile, Metaplanet raised $130 million to expand its BTC treasury. More Bitcoin treasury companies are set to emerge as $10 trillion asset manager, Vanguard, will start offering BTC ETFs from today. Notably, some companies gain BTC exposure through these ETFs rather than buying Bitcoin directly. On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, holds $300 million worth of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin treasuries such as Strategy are coming under immense pressure amid the current market downtrend. Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, admitted that they might have to sell Bitcoin as a last resort to fund dividend payments if their mNAV drops below 1x and they can no longer raise capital. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Starting next year, investment strategies at Bank of America’s Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms will support clients who want to allocate up to 4% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, the outlet reported. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, Bank of America Private Bank’s chief investment officer, reportedly said in a statement. Hyzy reportedly described “the lower end of this range” as suitable for investors with a conservative risk profile, with 4% being appropriate for those with high risk tolerances. On Jan. 5, Bank of America’s wealth management clients will also initiate coverage of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock, according to Yahoo Finance. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Decrypt request for comment. Yahoo Finance reported that, historically, Bank of America’s wealth management clients were only able to access crypto-related products upon request. Previously, that left over 15,000 wealth advisors at the firm unable to make crypto-related recommendations. The shift comes as Bitcoin’s price jumped to near $91,600 at one point Tuesday. BTC was currently up 7.6% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is off about 30% since hitting a record high above $126,000 in early October, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest investment companies, will soon begin letting people on its platform access crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds, Bloomberg reported on Monday. A Bitcoin-friendly CEO was appointed to the world’s second-largest asset manager in May. Last year, Fidelity suggested that people allocate between 2% and 5% to Bitcoin, with up to 7.5% being worth for young investors. Describing the asset as “unique,” the institution has explored allocations in hypothetical scenarios as early as 2020.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Judge Elma Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Advertisement Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told the judge that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Sexton told the court. The judge said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison. The judge revoked Kelly’s bail and remanded him in custody pending sentence next Monday 8 December. She said he was to be given the medical attention he required having been informed that he has a number of medical conditions. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Who will be the next Fed chair?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Kevin Hassett appears to be Trump’s pick President Donald Trump says he has chosen the next chair of the Federal Reserve, but he is not yet naming names publicly. Current National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett is widely expected to be the nominee, said Axios. Trump is not saying. “I’m not telling you, we’ll be announcing it,” he said to reporters. The next chair will replace Jerome Powell, who has “faced months of complaints and demands” from Trump to bring interest rates down more quickly, said Axios. Powell’s term does not end until May, so he may have to spend the final months of his term with a “shadow chair” peering over his shoulder, said Fortune. Trump officials have signaled their desire to undercut Powell even if he remains in his position. With a shadow chair in place, “no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Barron’s last year. The question for Wall Street, then, is “will Powell or his successor hold more sway with the markets?” said Fortune. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The likely choice of Hassett “appears to be about loyalty” to Trump, said John Authers at Bloomberg. Other possible nominees — including Bessent, as well as current Fed governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder — might feel compelled to “establish themselves as independent from the administration.” But being seen as a Trump loyalist could also force Hassett to prove his independence to “win the confidence of markets.” For now, though, “markets aren’t freaking out at the prospect of a Hassett chairmanship.” “Thank heavens” for Powell, said Brett Arends at MarketWatch. The latest numbers suggest the U.S. economy is “much stronger than people realized” even with the Fed chairman resisting Trump’s demanded rate cuts. If the president had gotten his way, the “likeliest scenario would be that inflation would be rocketing higher again.” Instead, the Federal Reserve has cut rates just twice this year and indicated another rate cut is unlikely in December. Americans should be grateful the current Fed chair has proven his independence and “refused to be intimidated” by Trump. Hassett would have “closer ties to the sitting president” than any modern Fed chair, said Axios. That might mean a quick drop in short-term rates, but long-term rates may stay high if Wall Street comes to believe he is “simply doing Trump’s bidding, with little regard for inflation.” That notion “might be difficult for a pick like Hassett to shake.” The next chair will face an unusually divided Fed board, said The Wall Street Journal. Fed chairs have ordinarily sought the “broadest possible consensus around rate decisions” and split votes have been rare. No longer. There is a “real prospect of three or more dissenting votes” at December’s meeting, whether Powell decides to pause rate cuts or continue them. “It’s not a slam dunk” that Trump’s choice will dictate policy as much as his predecessors, said Krishna Guha, a former New York Fed executive.

Bank of America’s new guidance lets advisers actively recommend Bitcoin ETFs, signaling rising institutional confidence despite the market pullback. Bank of America has officially opened the door for its wealth management clients to include crypto in their portfolios. They are recommending a 1%–4% allocation through regulated Bitcoin ETFs beginning 5 January 5. However, beyond the headline, what stands out is the timing of this shift — it arrives during a broad market pullback, not at a cycle peak. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, according to new data (from CoinMarketCap. That’s down sharply from $3.71T last month, yet still well above the $2.42T yearly low. Source: CoinMarketCap This paints a very different backdrop from the euphoric rallies that typically precede new institutional endorsements. Instead, BofA’s guidance lands during a corrective phase, suggesting the bank views crypto as a long-term asset class rather than short-term speculation. According to reports, beginning 5 January, Bank of America’s CIO office will formally cover and recommend four spot Bitcoin ETFs: This is the first time advisors on Merrill, Private Bank, and Merrill Edge can proactively recommend crypto exposure — a major shift from the previous “request-only” framework that kept many clients from accessing the asset class. CIO Chris Hyzy framed the allocation as appropriate for investors “with interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility,” emphasizing regulated products and risk-aligned sizing [1–4%]. Crypto’s market cap has cooled from its late-summer highs, mirroring Bitcoin’s fall from above $126,000 to the mid-$80,000 range. Yet institutions are increasing, not decreasing, their engagement: The trend shows that Wall Street wants regulated crypto exposure integrated into traditional portfolios, even during downturns. This suggests a growing institutional consensus that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to withstand — and potentially benefit from — cyclical volatility. By allowing crypto allocations at a moment when the total market cap has dipped nearly $600 billion in a month, Bank of America is signaling: It’s a different kind of institutional endorsement — one that doesn’t chase hype but leans into market structure, regulation, and portfolio construction.
