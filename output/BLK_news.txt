Title: Saudi Aramco second-quarter net profit drops 22%
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0805/1526941-saudi-aramco-second-quarter-net-profit-drops-22/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T07:46:11Z
Full Content:
Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco reported a 22% drop in second-quarter profit today, mainly on lower revenue, while it racked up more debt. The world's top oil exporter reported a net profit of $22.7 billion in the three months ended June 30, missing a company-provided median estimate from 17 analysts of $23.7 billion. Aramco's average realised crude oil price was $66.7 a barrel in the quarter, down from $85.7 in the second quarter of 2024 and $76.3 in the first quarter of this year. Total borrowing rose to $92.9 billion at June 30 from $74.4 a year prior. Gearing, a measure of indebtedness, rose to 6.5% from minus 0.3% a year earlier and 5.3% the previous quarter. The company, long a cash cow for the Saudi state, confirmed a previously outlined $21.3 billion in total dividends for the second quarter, roughly $200 million of which is performance-linked dividends, a mechanism introduced after a windfall from oil prices in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Aramco in March outlined total dividends of $85.4 billion for 2025 - a 37% drop from its payout of over $124 billion the previous year. The performance-linked component is set to plunge 98% to $900 million as the company's free cash flow dwindles. Free cash flow dropped nearly a fifth year-on-year in the second quarter to $15.2 billion. Reuters reported last month that Aramco is close to a deal to raise around $10 billion in investment from a group led by BlackRock and is considering selling up to five of its gas-powered power plants to raise up to $4 billion, as Riyadh presses the company to increase profit and payout. For the Saudi government, which owns 81.5% of Aramco shares directly and another 16% through its sovereign wealth fund PIF, dividends are a critical source of income, particularly as it spends on efforts to diversify the economy away from oil. Oil generated 62% of the government's revenue last year. The International Monetary fund estimates the kingdom needs oil at more than $90 a barrel to balance its 2025 budget. Global crude benchmark Brent was trading at $68.83 at 0625 GMT. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirms Operation Mockingbirdâs ongoing influence, linking it to CIA tactics weaponizing media and intelligence to undermine President Trump. $900M Biden Propaganda Campaign fueled distrust in the CDC through misleading data on masks, vaccines and child health. Scientists admit psychological tactics â including fear-based manipulation â were employed during the pandemic. Modern Mockingbird Tools include algorithmic censorship, social media surveillance and Big Tech partnerships. Trumpâs Agenda aims to dismantle âDeep Stateâ media propaganda apparatuses, per Gabbard. $900M Biden Propaganda Campaign fueled distrust in the CDC through misleading data on masks, vaccines and child health.

Trumpâs Agenda aims to dismantle âDeep Stateâ media propaganda apparatuses, per Gabbard. Trumpâs Agenda aims to dismantle âDeep Stateâ media propaganda apparatuses, per Gabbard. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard dropped a literary-sized bombshell on American democracy this week, confirming Cold War-era intelligence tactics are now targeting U.S. citizens. The CIAâs infamous Operation Mockingbird â once a tool for influencing foreign and domestic media â is, she says, alive and weaponized to undercut the Trump administration and distort public opinion. In a July 31 interview with conservative host Benny Johnson, Gabbard described intelligence insiders leaking secrets exclusively to âfriendsâ in corporate media, including Fox News and CNN, though their parent companies are owned by globalist-aligned firms like BlackRock (a World Economic Forum partner). âThey believe their will is more important than yours,â Gabbard warned. âWeaponizing public records to sabotage elected leadership is an attack on constitutional order and the American people.â This isnât fringe conspiracyÂ â Gabbard, a former U.S. Congressmember, has official authority to corroborate it.Â Nor is it limited to leaks: Todayâs âMockingbird 2.0â uses artificial intelligence, corporate surveillance and $900 million in federal propaganda funneled into media narratives during Bidenâs pandemic response. "The CDC was a propaganda machine": The $900M truth Gabbardâs warnings align with a 2024 House report that found Bidenâs CDC spent taxpayer money to spread âerroneousâ data during the pandemic. According to the Energy and Commerce Committee, ads exaggerated vaccine efficacy, underplayed childrenâs risks and partnered with Big Tech to monitor Americans. Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said the campaign eroded trust in public health entirely: âThey weaponized fear. Millions believed threats that either lacked evidence or were exaggerated.â Perhaps most alarming: House investigators revealed the CDC distributed messaging that conflicted with FDA authorization â flagrantly violating its role as a regulatory body. Whistleblowers expose fear as a weapon Gabbardâs claims gained credibility when former UK pandemic advisors admitted to exploiting psychological tactics from 2020â2022. A Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group (SPI-B) member told JonFleetwood.com: âFear smacked of totalitarianism.â The groupâs psychologists inflated risks to justify lockdowns, even while knowing public resistance could weaken compliance. One member now calls the program âdystopian,â admitting, âWe handed dictators a playbook.â Modern Mockingbird tools While the original Mockingbird relied on clandestine journalist recruitment, todayâs iteration is digital, mass-scale and taxpayer-funded. Gabbardâs team identified five key mechanisms: Leaked intel narratives: Directed to âloyalâ media for manipulated headlines. AI censorship: Social platforms suppress dissent through algorithmic bias. CDC youth influencers: Funded accounts âtesting the waterâ on experimental drugs. Surveillance partnerships: Tech giants hand over private data under âpublic healthâ mandates. Fear psychology: Campaigns weaponized child vaccination mandates to gin public outrage. The end of the domino theory? Or just the beginning? Operation Mockingbirdâs resurrection serves as a eulogy for the American pressâs perceived independence. The Church Committeeâs 1975 findings âÂ exposing CIA ties with the New York Times, TimeÂ and CBSÂ â were labeled âconspiracy theories.â Now, Gabbard validates its continuation in digital warfare. President Trump tapped Gabbard to dismantle this apparatus, and she insists his election victory was no accident. âThe public sees it,â Gabbard says, âand thatâs why this fight is personal.â The Mockingbird sings for democracy Gabbardâs revelation forces a reckoning: When government agencies use media as propaganda arsenals, democracy dies in darkness. Whether Mockingbirdâs revival is a âcovert programâ or institutionalized overreach, its effects are clear â erosion of trust, facilitated censorship and a public increasingly weaponized against itself. As Harper Leeâs Atticus Finch said, killing innocence mocks the very society that commits it. Tulsi Gabbardâs fight isnât just about accountability. Itâs about preserving journalismâs soul â and democracyâs future.

Title: Energy transition: Waratah Super battery, Australia’s biggest, turns on at Munmorah Power Station site for BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy

One of the most powerful batteries built anywhere in the world has started operating at the site of an old coal-fired power station in New South Wales, delivering a critical boost to the eastern seaboard’s electricity grid as it transitions to cleaner energy sources. United States-based asset giant BlackRock’s Akaysha Energy said on Tuesday it had activated the first batch of capacity from its $1 billion Waratah Super Battery, a project spanning the size of eight Australian rules football fields at the shuttered Munmorah Power Station site on the NSW Central Coast. BlackRock is involved with the Waratah Super Battery in NSW, which will rank among the biggest grid-scale batteries anywhere in the world. The huge storage system would initially work like a “shock absorber” to buffer the network from disruptions caused by events such as lightning strikes or bushfires, the company said. Grid-scale batteries, with response times measured in split seconds, are seen as essential to Australia’s green energy shift because of their ability to soak up surplus renewable output in daylight hours and use it to plug gaps in supply and stabilise the system at times of low wind and sunlight, or during unexpected outages. While the Waratah Super Battery would initially be limited to 350 megawatts, it would reach 850 megawatts with 1680 megawatt hours of storage once it ramped to full capacity, which may be as early as the end of the year, Akaysha said on Tuesday. This would make it the most powerful utility-scale battery in the world, although other larger projects are under construction elsewhere in Australia and globally. Australia is experiencing one of the world’s fastest energy transitions as polluting coal-fired generators, which still supply most of the grid’s electricity, reach the end of their lives, while wind and solar farms are expanding their role in the grid every year. Australians are also world leaders in per-person solar uptake, with more than 4 million homes – or one in three – now fitted with rooftop solar panels. However, all those solar panels are making far too much electricity in the middle of the day when the sun is brightest, and hardly any when the grid needs it most – in the evenings when the sun sets and demand spikes as people arrive home and turn on lights and appliances. To help balance wild swings in supply and demand before the next wave of coal plant closures, Australian governments, utilities and investors are pouring billions of dollars into developing large, flexible battery storage systems across the grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator has been calling for greater investment in “firming” assets, including batteries and hydroelectric dams, alongside a new fleet of fast-ramping, gas-fired power stations to prepare the grid for a rapidly approaching future without coal. Switching on the Waratah Super Battery was a “win for our grid, and a win for households and businesses”, said Hannah McCaughey, chief executive of NSW government-owned EnergyCo, which is overseeing the project’s delivery. “It will help provide clean, reliable and affordable energy to the people of our state and the national electricity market,” she said. Akaysha Energy chief executive Nick Carter described the start-up of the first 350 megawatts of the Waratah Super Battery as a “major milestone, and a moment of real pride” for the Melbourne-based company, which was bought by BlackRock in 2023. Transgrid, which owns and operates the high-voltage transmission network in NSW, said the Waratah Super Battery had been contracted to provide automated real-time system monitoring services for 36 transmission lines to detect overloading and respond within seconds. “In network contingency events such as lightning strikes, the System Integrity Protection Scheme acts as a shock absorber to return the network to a stable condition and maintain continuity of supply for consumers,” Transgrid general manager Jennifer Hughes said. “It’s like an insurance policy for NSW, and the whole system is triggered automatically, making it fast and reliable in responding to a system event or fault.” The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

According to the filing, the CoinShares Solana Staking ETF will hold SOL but also stake “a portion” of its holdings, with BitGo set to serve as the fund’s custodian and its staking partner. CoinShares doesn’t specify the likely percentage of the fund’s holdings that will be staked, but it does acknowledge the hypothetical risk that it may “become unable to timely meet excessive redemption requests in amounts that are greater than the portion of the Trust’s SOL that remains un-staked.” Despite this potential risk, the CoinShares Solana Staking ETF joins several similar filings in recent weeks, with the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale and 21Shares all applying to add staking to their existing Ethereum ETFs. Invesco Galaxy has also filed an application for its own Solana staking ETF within the past week, while the Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF launched last month after gaining automatic approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The latter fund attracted $12 million in first-day inflows and currently has assets under management of $137 million, indicating considerable early demand for Solana ETFs. The potential for growth in such funds has also been underlined by the recent successes of Ethereum ETFs, which now boast a total AUM of $27.5 billion, according to the latest CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows report. The past month has seen record inflows into ETH ETFs, which grew by $5.24 billion between July 1 and August 1, according to data from Farside. This is roughly comparable to the $5.5 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows over the same period, whereas Solana funds grew by only $137 million, thanks to the aforementioned Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF. In total, Solana-based funds currently boast an AUM of $2.4 billion, which is only 8.7% of the equivalent total for Ethereum funds, whereas Solana’s market cap is approximately 20% of ETH’s. However, while demand for Solana (and altcoin) ETFs is likely to rise in the coming months, some analysts don’t think the inclusion of staking will make a substantial difference. This is the view of Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s Director of ETF & Passive Strategies, who tells Decrypt that he doesn’t expect staking alone to “meaningfully change” institutional demand. “Staking should make ETFs more efficient because they capture yield otherwise missed out on by unstaked spot ETFs, but the main driver of performance will be the underlying cryptocurrency,” he said. “I suspect institutional demand for staked Solana ETFs will come from the desire for diversified crypto exposures, like with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, in case one significantly outperforms or underperforms the others.” However, some industry figures do believe that staking will be an added draw for institutional investors, who previously may have been turned off by the perceived difficulty of staking for themselves. “Institutional demand for staking ETFs is rising fast as investors look for yield without the operational complexity of staking directly,” says James Harris, the Group CEO of DeFi platform Tesseract, speaking to Decrypt. According to Harris, such products will simplify access to protocols such as Ethereum and Solana, the latter of which currently has yields of between 7% and 8%. "It’s a natural evolution: If investors can choose between holding SOL alone or holding SOL while also earning a protocol-native yield, it’s a no-brainer that they’ll prefer the latter,” he added. On the other hand, Harris acknowledges that staking introduces some “execution risk” on top of standard custody and counterparty risk, although in his view the reward generally justifies the added complexity. In particular, the main execution risk involves the aforementioned difficulty of providing redemptions when most of a fund’s SOL is staked, something which Armour recognizes as the primary danger. “Un-staking could take anywhere from hours to several days, with the average time reportedly two to three days,” he explained. “ETF redemptions settle within one day, so the ETF cannot stake the entire portfolio and expect to meet redemptions.” Given this risk, Armour expects that most staking ETFs will ensure that enough of its holdings aren’t staked, although he also accepts that it’s possible that redemptions could exceed the liquid portion of a given fund, creating issues for the ETF and its market makers. He said, “In this scenario, I would expect the price of the ETF to trade at a discount to its net asset value, forcing investors to sell their shares at a discount if they wanted to get out.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Ethereum’s user base and network activity are surging, driven by a rapid spike in daily address creation. Calling out this development, market analyst Peter noted that Ethereum recently registered more than 256,000 new daily addresses, a surge seen only twice before. First, ahead of the 2017 bull run and right before ETH set new all-time highs of $4,878 in 2021. History may not repeat, but it’s echoing loudly. Therefore, Ethereum is experiencing a burst of attention and on-chain engagement, signaling a potentially bullish setup, with momentum building for a possible price breakout. At the time of this writing, Ethereum was up by 5.30% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3,643. Meanwhile, a renowned market analyst recently predicted that Ethereum could soar to $13,000 by Q4 2025, calling the target both bold and achievable. According to market analyst Peter, “ETH ETFs are finally waking up. In July alone, over $4B flowed into ETHA, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF. That’s a newmonthly record.” Therefore, as more capital flowed into BlackRock’s ETHA in a single month than ever before, a strong case is being made for the Ethereum ETF ecosystem because it has crossed the threshold into legitimacy. This explains why ETH is targeting the psychological price of $4,800 as BlackRock advances plans to enable staking in Spot ETH ETF.

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. A coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to executives at 25 firms, pushing them to denounce climate and net-zero commitments. The push against the use of ESG factors, such as climate considerations in investment decisions and proxy engagement, follows Wall Street’s exodus from climate alliances earlier this year, spurred by mounting pressure from Republican-led state probes and changes in federal leadership. Such departures and climate commitment walkbacks have led to some states dropping previous state-level probes into the banks, including in Texas and Tennessee. The finance officials represent states including Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah. The letter tells asset management firms “seeking to do business” in those states that they should abandon framing climate change as a long-term risk and incorporating net-zero standards. the missive also asks firms to disclose any coalition or collaborative organizations they have memberships in and align proxy voting guidelines “with shareholder value, not environmental or social goals posed by activists.” “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The officials alleged that the “potential risks” of climate change “are framed as certain and catastrophic to justify forcing companies to take immediate actions that may not align with their long-term business interests.” Similarly, the letters frame issues like net-zero and CSRD incorporation and alignment as relying on “predetermined political outcomes, not fiduciary judgment.” The other firms who received the July 29 form letter include Affiliated Managers Group, Alliance Bernstein, BNY Investments and Wealth, Capital Group, Dimensional Fund Advisors, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton, Geode Capital Management, MFS Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, Neuberger Berman, Northern Trust, Nuveen, Prudential, Schwab Asset Management, T. Rowe Price, Wellington Management, and Wells Fargo Wealth and Investments. The state finance officials are seeking a response to their probe by Sept. 1 and have also encouraged targeted investment managers to engage with the offices of the undersigned treasurers, auditors, comptrollers and other state finance officials. According to the July 29 letter, some asset managers have already initiated correspondence with said state officials. Republican finance officials from Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming also signed onto the letter.

A Texas federal court has ruled against dismissing a lawsuit that implicates several of the world’s leading asset management firms in an alleged scheme to manipulate the coal industry. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle has determined that most of the claims, which suggest that BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street’s asset management branch engaged in anti-competitive behaviour, warrant further examination in court. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more In the ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” The legal action, spearheaded by Attorney General Paxton in November 2024, accused the asset managers of leveraging their substantial holdings to influence coal companies to cut production by 50% by the year 2030, aligning with certain environmental objectives. This purported collusion is said to have artificially constrained supply, driving up electricity costs and resulting in significant profit increases for the investment firms—allegations that the defendants had sought to dismiss. Paxton said: “BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—three of the most powerful financial corporations in the world—created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “Today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable. I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy.” The Trump administration initiated legal action in May 2025.

Title: Bitcoin And Crypto Are Quietly Braced For A ‘Monstrous’ BlackRock ETF Price Earthquake

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have swung wildly over the last week after a $300 billion sell-off sparked fears of a crypto crash. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has lost almost 10% since hitting an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin, with analysts speculating a bitcoin price game-changer could have already quietly happened. Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, Wall Street giant BlackRock could be poised to extend its huge bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) lead over its rivals. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week authorized the use of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The long-awaited move is part of the SEC’s overhaul of former chair Gary Gensler’s preference for crypto exchange-traded products to be cash only, which was perceived to be a barrier to efficiency for institutional market makers. “It’s a new day at the SEC, and a key priority of my chairmanship is developing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for crypto asset markets,” SEC chair Paul Atkins said in a statement. “The biggest takeaway is symbolic. It means there is a new sheriff in town,” Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the financial newswire. "Gensler’s SEC did not want this to happen. This is the first of what will be several steps toward a more pro-crypto SEC.” BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager which runs the dominant spot bitcoin ETF with $85 billion in assets under management, filed a request in January to allow in-kind transactions. Others, including Fidelity, which runs the second-largest bitcoin fund with $23 billion in assets under management, followed suit. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold almost 1.5 million bitcoin worth $170 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious BlackRock’s fund alone holds 3.5% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $85 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Alongside the authorization of in-kind crypto ETFs, the SEC has also approved a Nasdaq proposal to increase a position limit for options on BlackRock’s IBIT to 250,000 contracts, up from 25,000, expected to "help bring in bigger institutions and be helpful during volatility,” Balchunas posted to X. While BlackRock’s bitcoin fund is expected to benefit from the change, the second-largest bitcoin fund, run by Fidelity, could see its market share shrink, according to NYDIG’s global head of research Greg Cipolaro. “The change is likely to widen the monstrous lead that IBIT already has over the other players, while it hobbles [Fidelity’s] position as the second-largest options player,” Cipolaro wrote in a report. “As volatility declines, [bitcoin] becomes more investable for institutional portfolios seeking balanced risk exposure. This dynamic could reinforce spot demand. With risk-parity pioneer Ray Dalio recently advocating for a 15% portfolio allocation to gold and crypto in the face of ballooning government debt, the feedback loop of falling volatility leading to increased spot buying could become a powerful driver of sustained demand.” Last week, legendary billionaire Ray Dalio set markets alight when he recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.”

Title: SEC Is Now All In On Crypto. What’s Next?

The agency approved in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last week, but the move may just the beginning for Atkins’ SEC. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Crypto funds are about to become a whole lot more regulated — or deregulated, depending on who you ask. After initial delays, the SEC has approved in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The decision is the first pro-crypto policy decision by Paul Atkins, the SEC chair confirmed earlier this year who is expected to help realize crypto evangelists’ digital currency dreams. The move also is the first major indication that the crypto industry — whose super PACs donated tens of millions to President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign — is getting what it expected. The decision marked “the biggest day for crypto in the history of the space,” said financial consultant Tyrone Ross Jr. “This administration, whether it’s custody, whether it’s on-chain, whether it’s ETFs … they’re making sure that crypto thrives in America.” In-kind redemptions let investors create and redeem shares of spot crypto ETFs without having to use cash — meaning authorized participants, the people with the power to change the number of ETF shares on the market, can now add or remove assets from a fund using Bitcoin or Ethereum. In a statement on the approval, Atkins said the decision is only the first step toward building “a rational regulatory framework for crypto.” But how much of these changes can be attributed to the Trump administration? “One hundred percent,” said Ross. “They are hell-bent on America becoming the main hub for crypto in the world.” Other measures approved by the agency were: The SEC’s likely next move is specifying which coins are and aren’t securities, Ross said. “That’s the big one that everyone is still waiting for,” he said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is also likely to eventually update its guidance on what it will oversee, he added. Keeping Options Open. In-kind redemption approvals took place alongside another policy change to increase positions limits for options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, IBIT — the biggest crypto ETF on the market — from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts. BlackRock has been among the most prominent issuers pushing for deregulation, having filed for in-kind redemptions back in January. “It’s huge for the individual investor. It’s huge for BlackRock,” Ross said. “It’s huge for the entire space.” With the continent’s active ETF industry set to balloon to $1 trillion within the decade, stateside managers are joining the fray. Not since the pandemic have US gold ETFs seen such demand, with geopolitical and economic uncertainty driving people to the safe-haven asset. Financial services firms could test uses for AI in “regulatory sandboxes,” according to legislation introduced last week. Wealthier people are less likely to value financial advice, but there are consequences to trading ETFs outside of advisory relationships. Consistent income and returns that mute market highs and lows are what an aging population demands from an ETF, the company says. Bitcoin, Ether and other crypto ETFs are no longer limited to cash transactions — they can use in-kind creation and redemption. BlackRock and Vanguard have raked in cash in very different places, highlighting some of the differences in their ETF customer bases. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has emerged as the lead market maker of the $34 million Capital Group US Large Growth ETF. The faith-based ETF segment focuses less on generating alpha and more on adhering to religious principles and values. The world’s leading beverage company plans to add a cane-sugar version of its namesake beverage in the US. The agency this week delayed approving Bitwise’s ETF conversion, a sign of hesitancy despite a crypto-friendly government. Crossmark, which provides similar values-screening strategies in SMAs, is applying them to a pair of ETFs. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: US Power Grab of Global Ports Runs Out of Steam Following Pressure From Beijing
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/08/us-power-grab-of-global-ports-runs-out-of-steam-following-pressure-from-beijing.html

Full Content:
The US attempt to bring global ports under Western control in order to squeeze Beijing looks dead in the water. Despite Trump’s bluster, China quietly shut the scheme down. We’ll detail how they did so, but first the relevant background. Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. BlackRock was to take control of the two in Panama while the Italian tycoon-controlled Mediterranean Shipping Company controlled the others. It was sold as a major win for Washington on the geopolitical chess board—one that could raise prices on or refuse Chinese ships or allow the US to militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China at critical chokepoints. During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump said of the Panama Canal, “We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Well, okay. But on July 27, the deadline to finalize the deal passed without anyone signing on the dotted line. That’s because Beijing saw the Trump administration conspiring with the takeover consortium while applying pressure on Hutchison and said two can play at that game. Beijing responded by launching a regulatory review of the deal —although the company’s base is in Hong Kong and there aren’t direct Chinese assets involved in the sale — and said the deal shouldn’t be implemented without its approval. If that warning wasn’t clear enough, the family of Hutchison founder Li Ka-shing, the ninety-six-year-old billionaire who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2000, saw their business empire come under pressure. From Bloomberg: Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The ports deal is now fully wrapped up in the ongoing trade and other tensions between Beijing and Washington. That’s a game that even Politico admits the US is losing—and badly, largely driven by Washington delusions: Panama isn’t 1989. There’s no Noriega to oust. There’s no Cold War to rally around. Today, China funds the projects. China builds the rails. China moves the cargo. (5/11) — William Huo (@wmhuo168) July 29, 2025 What Trump revealed in Panama was the depth of his illusion. He thinks he’s Machiavelli. In reality, he’s a failed landlord trying to evict China from global trade routes it already owns. (10/11) — William Huo (@wmhuo168) July 29, 2025 What Now? It looks like China will get its way. Here’s Bloomberg: CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. Will Trump still try to sell it as a major victory “retaking” Panama Canal? One would guess so, although he might have to wait a while. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant for the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, told the South China Morning Post that he expected the deal deadline to be extended with China’s state-owned enterprise China Cosco Shipping Corporation potentially joining the consortium. The bottom line is that if China opposes the deal, it is “highly likely to be called off”. “If Cosco has some form of ownership and decision-making power in the ports’ future operations, ensuring that Chinese cargo ships and shipping companies are treated fairly and not discriminated against, then China’s key interests would be protected, and it would give the transaction a green light,” Lau said. Or as Bloomberg puts it: Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. No doubt. Cosco joining the consortium defeats the whole purpose of the deal Washington was supporting. Here’s the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of China strongly-worded comment on the matter a few months back, and it’s hard to disagree with its argument that the proposed transaction was not an “ordinary commercial activity,” but rather a hegemonic act in which the US was employing state power—through coercion, pressure, and inducements—to seize the legitimate rights and interests of another country. Here’s more: Once the Panama Canal is “Americanized” and “politicized,” the United States will undoubtedly use it for political purposes to advance its own political agenda, and China’s shipping and trade will inevitably be controlled by the US. If the United States were to implement measures such as selective capacity restrictions or imposing “political surcharges,” Chinese companies’ logistics costs and supply chain stability would face great risks. Some netizens also noted that through this deal, BlackRock would control about 10.4% of the world’s container terminal throughput, joining the ranks of the world’s top three port operators, and it is entirely possible that it would work in concert with US policies to suppress China, raising costs for Chinese cargo and squeezing the market share of Chinese shipping companies. Moreover, this transaction creates a major gap in the port network that Chinese companies have built up over the years, thereby allowing American interests to erode their overseas development advantages. Other netizens even point out that the United States might use this transaction as a “template” to spark a wave of port mergers and acquisitions worldwide through political pressure, thereby controlling more critical ports globally and employing “long-arm jurisdiction” to suppress China, leaving Chinese vessels with “no reliable haven.” This is by no means mere fearmongering. According to a draft executive order from the US government, plans are already underway to charge Chinese vessels special docking fees, and the US will urge its allies to take similar measures, otherwise facing retaliation. If all of the United States’ calculated moves succeed, they will undoubtedly impact China’s shipbuilding, shipping, foreign trade, and even the Belt and Road Initiative, and will directly affect Hong Kong’s efforts to consolidate and elevate its position as an international shipping and trade center, while threatening and undermining the normal global order and safety of shipping and trade. So it’s unsurprising that Beijing threw its weight around to nix the deal. There was noise in the Western media that Beijing might have to use heavy-handed means to do so. Reuters opined that Beijing might use extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying its anti-monopoly law, claiming that the deal, even though outside mainland China, would affect, eliminate or restrict competition in China’s domestic market. Another option, according to Reuters, was the 2020 National Security Law, which goes after “terrorism,” subversives, secessionists, and colluders with foreign forces.” In the end, China didn’t even need to do much more than lift a finger, which likely hurts the fallback option. If China was forced to go the heavy-handed route, it was to be expected that it would hurt the Hong Kong financial center’s global standing as the US would paint Beijing as unfriendly to outside business interests. There are, of course, still claims of that sort percolating out: Xi’s China isn’t a market—it’s a trap. CK Hutchison begging for a CCP-approved investor shows how far business must crawl to feed Xi’s delusions of total control.👇 https://t.co/QSdIE8qOzZ — Jay T (@Jay83214566) July 28, 2025 Not sure how such claims fit with Trump huddling with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink over the deal, the whole Tik Tok saga, and numerous other examples, but what do I know? Investors, however, are pumped by the potential inclusion of Cosco. From Bloomberg: Investors are regaining enthusiasm for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. despite a delay in the company’s plan to sell 43 ports, with optimism fueled by news that a Chinese shipping behemoth is finding its way into the global deal. Shares of CK Hutchison, which oscillated between gains and losses since the company first announced the deal on March 4, reached the highest this year on Friday after state-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. emerged as a potential new member of the buyer consortium that includes American asset manager BlackRock Inc. That leaves the Trump administration in the unenviable position of trying to swim upstream against the interests of investors, logistics, and simple logic—increasingly familiar terrain for the US these days. Singapore’s PM has laid it out. He knows the U.S. has abandoned the multilateral trading system, upon which Singaporeans wealth is based. There’s only one stable force with the heft to anchor multilateral trade in this episode of disruption. It’s China. https://t.co/Zb0sZnEOZq — Warwick Powell | 鲍韶山 (@baoshaoshan) April 5, 2025 Will Washington accept reality? If recent history is any indication, that is unlikely. And there are plenty of other ways the US can try to shake things up and burn things down at maritime chokepoints in an effort to improve its bargaining position with Beijing. Trump continues to bomb away at Somalia making a bad situation worse. Meanwhile, Somaliland, which proclaimed independence from Somalia in 1991, is now offering the US a military base at the entrance to the Red Sea and critical-minerals deals if the US will recognize it as a state. That also happens to be what Project 2025 recommends, arguing that “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” That position in Djibouti is, of course, almost all about China. Down at the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Just recently the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan(!) piece of legislation that would direct the president to assess whether South Africa is undermining U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives, and that means sanctions are likely incoming. There was also the fact that U.S. Southern Command was/is partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces and drawing up plans to seize the Panama Canal by force—only if necessary, of course. Does the failure of the Hutchinson deal and the overall inability of the US to effectively coerce Beijing make it more likely the US goes through with such threats? I guess we’ll have to wait and see. ‘Down at the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Just recently the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bipartisan(!) piece of legislation that would direct the president to assess whether South Africa is undermining U.S. national security or foreign policy objectives, and that means sanctions are likely incoming.’ The South Africans, if they came under such an attack, should tell Washington that if they do not knock it off, that they will offer the Chinese and/or Russians a naval base in their country instead so wouldn’t they prefer a more neutral country? From what I have seen, once the US establishes a base in a foreign country and spend big money to build it up, the next step is to completely capture the host country so that there is no possibility of them being turfed out. South Africa would be no different. Another naval base as the US navy shrinks and cannot man what it has? Same old game from the old and increasingly tattered neocon/CIA/NGO playbook or beware the camel’s nose. I find it curious that in none of the discussions I have read is whether Blackrock will manage the ports as efficiently as under Chinese corporate ownership. China’s ports are by far the World’s most advanced (the automation and throughput are mind-blowing). The record of Black Rock with residential real estate and health care suggests it will maximize short-term profitability at the cost of long-term sustainability, shipping costs, and efficiency (maximizing shareholder value – not a surprise). Given that Ports are essential (and strategic, including military) infrastructure where costs (and thus profits) should be minimized to maximize shipping efficiency for the national benefit, often with significant state investment (e.g., the Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach receiving multibillion-dollar electrification upgrades from US DOT grants). Such massive subsidies are of clear interest to Black Rock. But are such massive subsidies to Black Rock-controlled companies really in the public interest (or will they introduce friction into shipping)? As the US is now seeking to turn global Port infrastructure into a geostrategic weapon, a more direct governmental control of these infrastructure hubs, vital to China’s export economy, is consistent with Cosco playing a greater role to secure these assets against being used as a weapon against China.

Δ LendingClub was up 21% for the week on strong earnings. The company’s second-quarter call painted a picture of borrowers who are borrowing more, paying better and sticking around. Personal-loan originations climbed 32% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion, helped by repeat customers who still account for roughly half of the volume. In comparison, the net charge-off ratio for loans held on the bank’s books fell to 3%, about half last year’s level. Strong credit trends let the company boost loan sales and net interest income, driving total revenue up 33% to $248 million and GAAP profit to $38 million. Deposit-gathering also accelerated: LevelUp Savings balances reached $2.7 billion, and the recently launched LevelUp Checking has spurred a six-fold jump in daily account openings, with close to 60% coming from existing borrowers — evidence that customers are deepening relationships rather than shopping elsewhere. Management cited “very high” marketplace demand for its paper, extending a Blue Owl funding pact and inking a first BlackRock transaction. As Chief Executive Scott Sanborn put it, “We’re not only consistently beating our competition, but we’re also beating our own expectations… our data is demonstrating the effectiveness of our underwriting and the resilience of our borrower base.” Cognex also posted strong earnings, leading to a 19% bounce. The maker of machine-vision cameras and AI software that helps factories and warehouses inspect products, track packages and guide robots said second-quarter revenue rose 4% to $249 million — its fourth straight quarter of organic growth — while disciplined spending lifted adjusted EBITDA margin to 20.7 %, the best showing in two years. Demand was broad-based: logistics booked a sixth consecutive period of double-digit gains, packaging sales grew mid-single digits on strength in healthcare and fast-moving consumer goods, and consumer-electronics orders stayed robust as device makers retooled overseas supply chains. Free cash flow reached $40 million, pushing 12-month conversion to 130 % of earnings, and management projected up to 9 % sales growth in the current quarter. “The momentum we saw in Q1 continued in Q2 with revenue of $249 million increasing 4 % year-on-year… our sales-force transformation is already generating good results and is an important component of this strategy,” Chief Executive Matthew Moschner told analysts. CyberArk rounded out the winners for the week. Its strong performance comes from the announcement that Palo Alto Networks, a heavyweight in AI-driven network, cloud and security-operations software, agreed to buy the company, which pioneered privileged-access and identity-security tools, in a cash-and-stock deal worth roughly $25 billion. CyberArk holders will receive $45 in cash and 2.2005 Palo Alto shares for each share they own — about a 26% premium to the stock’s 10-day average — and the news sent CyberArk shares sharply higher while positioning Palo Alto to add identity protection as a fourth pillar of its platform strategy. Management pitched the move as the right bet for an AI era that is spawning a boom in machine and agent identities: “Our market entry strategy has always been to enter categories at their inflection point, and we believe that moment for Identity Security is now,” Palo Alto Chief Executive Nikesh Arora said, calling CyberArk “the definitive leader” in the niche. CyberArk founder Udi Mokady framed the tie-up as an acceleration of his company’s two-decade mission, saying the combination “will bring unmatched expertise across human and machine identities, privileged access, and AI-driven innovation to secure what’s next.” Goldman’s Apple Card Partner Faces Uncertain Future US Workers See Wage Growth Slow With Lowest-Paid Hit Hardest Crypto Wobbles in August After New Tariffs Hit Apple AI Team Working on ChatGPT Rival We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Texas Judge Rules BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard Must Face Antitrust Suit

A federal judge in Texas largely denied a request by the world’s largest asset managers to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general claiming they colluded to reduce coal output, in a case that threatens how the U.S. firms oversee trillions of dollars. U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Texas said most of the claims brought by the states can proceed, including allegations that BlackRock Inc., BlackRock Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. collectively used their stock to attempt to substantially lessen competition. Kernodle dismissed part of the lawsuit that was based on alleged violations of state law. In his Friday ruling, Kernodle said the states “have identified enough circumstantial evidence to suggest that defendants agreed to collectively pressure coal companies to reduce the output of coal in the relevant markets and disclose future output information.” Representatives for the firms didn’t immediately return requests for comment on the ruling. In their lawsuit, Texas and other Republican-led states claimed the asset managers colluded to pressure coal producers to reduce their production under the guise of pursuing environmental goals. The states cite the firms’ participation in carbon-reduction alliances as evidence of a “syndicate.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard hold major stakes in coal producers and profited when energy prices soared, according to the suit. More recently, the firms have pulled back from ESG in the U.S. and participation in groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Texas even removed BlackRock from its blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels. But the lawsuit, filed in November, said that formal withdrawal from Climate 100+ “does not change the reality that defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition in violation” of U.S. antitrust law. Lawyers for the three firms argued at a hearing in June that the firms did nothing to influence coal companies. “The antitrust claims in this case are unprecedented, they’re unsound and they’re unsupported,” said Gregg Costa, a lawyer representing BlackRock. “The claims just don’t add up.” Topics Lawsuits Texas Legislation

Full Content:
The former chief executive of the Mater Private Network of hospitals and clinics Fergus Clancy left an estate valued at €15.8 million, according to documents published by the Probate Office this week. Mr Clancy, of Lagore Road, Dunshaughlin, Co Meath, died aged in his late 50s at the Mater hospital in April 2024. The married father of two began his professional life in the post room of insurance company Church & General before gaining experience handling medical malpractice cases. He went on to establish his own consultancy, Circa Healthcare Consulting. He also proposed a centralised State insurance scheme for doctors that was then adopted by former minister for health Brian Cowen. Following the sale of his consultancy to Aon, Mr Clancy became chief executive of the Mater Private Network in 2005, later taking the role of executive chairman. The Fergus Clancy Bursary for Healthcare Leadership and Entrepreneurship is awarded by the Future Health Summit to fully fund a person’s masters in healthcare leadership. The summit says the bursary is in honour of “our friend and colleague Fergus Clancy who showed such ambition, passion, determination and leadership in Irish healthcare over his long and distinguished career”. Meanwhile, Mervyn Howard Heatley, of Ballyman Road, Bray, Co Wicklow, a farmer who was noted for his collection of steam traction engines and vintage tractors, left an estate valued at €12.17 million, when he died in October last year. Mr Heatley, known as Howard, was a supporter of the Enniskerry Festival’s Victorian Field Day, which was held on his farm on a number of occasions. His son, also called Mervyn, runs a vintage car dealership called Classic Prestige Cars, which is based at Ballyman Road, Bray. The will of Mary Keegan, Dogstown, Trim, Co Meath, outlined an estate valued at €5.2 million when she died in February 2024. Ms Keegan was the widow of quarrying company executive Dessie Keegan. Jonathan Griffin, who also went by John, with an address at Bray Road, Foxrock, died in October 2023, leaving a €3.6 million estate. He was remembered for his attendance at the United Arts Club and time spent living in Chicago. After his death in November 2024, Cornelius Michael O’Riordan, of Meanus, Kilmallock, Co Limerick, left an estate of just more than €3 million. Monica Sheridan Dauer, of Mount Dutton House, Oldcastle, Co Meath, left an estate valued at €2.9 million when she died in August 2024. Eilis (Alice) Tansey, of Avoca Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, who died on March 8th, 2024, left €2.9 million. Edward (Ned) Grace of Seapoint Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, a retired Smurfit executive, left an estate worth €2.4 million when he died in December 2024. Lucy Mary Teresa Gannon and Kathleen Gannon, of a shared address on Serpentine Park, Ballsbridge, Dublin, each left €1.4 million upon their deaths in December 2020 and November 2022 respectively. Seán Gallagher, of Stillorgan Grove, Blackrock previously of CTT and Enterprise Ireland, left an estate of €1.2 million upon his death in January 2023. The estate figures represent the total value of all assets at the time of a person’s death. They typically include the value of a family home or farm and investments.

Photo: Sportsfile Pierce Brosnan in 1980s TV movie 'Murphy's Stroke', based on trainer Edward O'Grady Edward O’Grady, of Thurles, Co Tipperary, who has died aged 75, was the leading Irish trainer at Cheltenham in the 1980s and 1990s, but he first came to prominence in 1975 with his arrest at that festival in connection with the Gay Future betting coup, known to insiders as “Operation Crock of Gold”. The idea was a bait-and-switch, ­taking advantage of the backwardness of the Cartmel racecourse in Cumbria, which in 1974 had only just installed a permanent telephone but was not connected to the bookmakers’ ­Exchange Telegraph Blower system. The “Cork Mafia”, led by the building tycoon Tony Murphy, bought a promising chestnut called Gay Future. Officially Gay Future would be trained by a Scot (who was in on the scam) called Tony Collins, who had not had a winner in 18 months. In fact, the nag that plodded around Collins’s gallops was a chestnut lookalike, while the real Gay Future was sent in secret to be trained by O’Grady in Co Tipperary. Gay Future was sailed to ­Britain and handed over on a country road off the M6 48 hours before the ­Ulverston Novices’ Hurdle on the August Bank Holiday 1974. Trainer Edward O'Grady. Photo: Sportsfile At the last minute, the undistinguished jockey was swapped for the talented Timmy Jones, who simulated incompetence by falling off twice in the ring. One of O’Grady’s men, disguised in a wig and sunglasses, rubbed soap suds into Gay Future to make it look as if he were in a muck of sweat. The Cork Mafia, meanwhile, flew to London where they placed more than 500 double and treble bets on three Collins-trained runners across various courses: Gay Future at Cartmel, Opera Cloak at Plumpton and Ankerwyke at Southwell. The bookies accepted these so-called “hail Mary” bets greedily — unaware that both Opera Cloak and Ankerwyke would be pulled from their races, leaving them obliged to honour bets on Gay Future alone. At first, all went well. Gay Future romped home at 10-1. Cartmel’s single telephone was mysteriously cut off, so the starting price was unaffected by the turmoil of betting in London. The bookies who had taken the trebles were not unduly worried, as two more legs of the bet were still left to run. Panic only began to spike when Opera Cloak and Ankerwyke were both declared non-runners. The mistake that caused the coup to unravel was that the same reason was given for both horses’ withdrawals: a broken-down horsebox. A Daily Mail reporter rang up Collins’s yard in Scotland, to be told by his housekeeper that the horses were grazing in the paddock — they had never been sent at all. Sensing fraud, many bookmakers refused to pay up, and after a legal battle the Cork Mafia wound up collecting a fraction of their winnings. Collins and Murphy were convicted at Preston crown court for conspiracy to defraud. O’Grady was arrested but the charges were dropped; he took a helicopter back to the Cheltenham Festival, where he still had runners. Played by Pierce Brosnan in a thinly disguised version for the television film Murphy’s Stroke (1980), O’Grady never spoke about the Gay Future affair, observing: “Do you know what the mouse said to the trap? ‘We won’t go into that.’” Pierce Brosnan in 1980s TV movie 'Murphy's Stroke', based on trainer Edward O'Grady Edward Joseph O’Grady was born on September 27, 1949, son of three-times Irish champion jump jockey turned trainer Willie O’Grady, and his wife Mary (nee Hogan), sister of the trainer PP Hogan. From Blackrock College in Dublin he studied veterinary science until his father’s untimely death in 1972, when he took over the yard. He attracted the patronage of JP McManus, and became Ireland’s champion National Hunt trainer from 1977 to 1980. At Cheltenham he saddled 18 winners, starting with Mr Midland ridden by Mouse Morris in 1974 and ending with Sky’s The Limit in the 2006 Coral Cup — a strong showing for an Irishman in the pre-Willie-Mullins era and at the time behind only ­Vincent O’Brien and Arkle’s trainer Tom Dreaper. His finest horse was agreed to be Golden Cygnet, short-lived winner of the 1978 Supreme Novices’ Hurdle — “the James Dean of racing”, O’Grady said. He is survived by his third wife, Kay, by a son and two daughters from his first marriage and two daughters from his second marriage.

Title: 400 TPS and “Ethereum on your phone”: Vitalik Buterin & Tomasz K. Stańczak dropped big news at ETHKyiv 2025

ETHKyiv 2025 unveiled Ethereum's leap to 400 TPS, redefining network efficiency and accessibility. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post and opinion of Rostyslav Bortman, Founder of Ethereum Ukraine. Even in wartime Kyiv, innovation doesn’t pause. At ETHKyiv 2025, more than 100 hackers proved it—shipping privacy-first dApps, competing for grants, and showing what’s possible when the world’s toughest challenges meet Web3 grit. But the real shockwaves came from the founders themselves: Vitalik Buterin and Tomasz K. Stańczak, Executive Director at the Ethereum Foundation, who both appeared as the event’s online speakers, dropped two bombshells—400 TPS on Ethereum L1 this year, and a near future where anyone can run a full node on their smartphone. So what’s next for the protocol? When does 400 TPS arrive, and what does “Ethereum on your phone” actually mean for developers and users? Here’s what we learned at ETHKyiv 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s keynote at ETHKyiv 2025 cut straight to Ethereum’s core roadmap. The biggest reveal: “Pretty soon you’ll be able to spin up a node on your smartphones and even smartwatches.” According to Buterin, instead of relying on servers with terabytes of storage, soon users will be able to run a full Ethereum node “without heavy-duty resources.” This first-of-its-kind case will be possible thanks to zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) that the Ethereum Foundation is currently implementing. zkEVMs are making nodes drastically lighter, cutting storage through verifying transactions without revealing and importing any information about them. On Ethereum’s L2s, zkEVMs already cut transaction costs by up to 90% and settle in their finality under three seconds. Buterin said the next step is bringing these improvements to the Ethereum mainnet, making blockchain interactions on it as fast and affordable as traditional web applications. At ETHKyiv 2025, Tomasz K. Stańczak, Co-Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, spelled out exactly what’s next for Ethereum’s backbone: real performance gains on the mainnet itself. He revealed that by the end of 2026, Ethereum will move to 3-Slot Finality (3SF), slashing average transaction confirmation time from 15 minutes down to only 36 seconds. For users, this will bring the experience of instant traditional digital payments while keeping all the benefits of decentralization. Stańczak laid out the near-term milestones: Ethereum L1 will hit 400 transactions per second (TPS) by the end of 2025. Block gas limits will reach 100 million this year, with a jump to 60 million per block in a month or two (as of publication date—ed.). For context: scaling Ethereum L1 is essential because it anchors the entire ecosystem, providing the security, settlement, and censorship resistance Layer 2s depend on. With faster mainnet throughput, users get greater assurance their transactions are finalized on a decentralized, global network—not bottlenecked by L2 operators. As Vitalik Buterin summed up: “The goal is to make Ethereum more private, more censorship-resistant, and at the same time, so easy that even people far from tech feel safe using it every day.” For me and all the Ethereum followers, some big questions have always remained: what actually underpins Ethereum’s value, and what could trigger mass adoption? When I pressed both Vitalik Buterin and Tomasz Stańczak for answers at ETHKyiv 2025, they each zeroed in on different but connected drivers. Tomasz pointed to three non-negotiables: privacy, data protection, and transparency. According to him, these are precisely what enterprise clients and regular users now expect from any blockchain platform. “Ethereum is a global network, and increased adoption directly boosts the value of the whole ecosystem,” he explained. The more Ethereum is used for real-world utility—by businesses and by individuals—the more demand, and ultimately, value accrues. Vitalik, meanwhile, framed the adoption question around financial utility. His thesis: mass adoption comes when Ethereum becomes the rails for real-world assets, particularly tokenized stocks and bonds. “They’re the gateway to mass adoption and the bridge between traditional finance and Web3,” he said. With heavyweights like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, and Coinbase actively leveraging Ethereum for asset tokenization, we’re already seeing the lines blur between traditional finance’s $117 trillion market and Web3 infrastructure. In short: Ethereum’s real value isn’t just speculative, but it’s being built right now at the intersection of security, privacy, and practical financial applications. That’s where mass adoption starts to look inevitable. ETHKyiv 2025 indeed stood out for its access to global thought leaders. Despite all the war-related risks, developers here heard first-hand insights from Ethereum’s most influential builders. As Stańczak himself described it: “Enterprise, DeFi, explorations, AI, research, day-to-day problems, working with people—we have to understand the direction and give feedback. A lot of it.” His daily routine—hours spent answering questions from developers—underscores how Ethereum’s power lies in its people, not just its protocol. Crucially, ETHKyiv 2025 was never just another tech event on the calendar. Held against the backdrop of an ongoing war, it became living proof of something bigger: even in the darkest times, Ukraine’s tech community chooses to build, learn, and connect with the global ecosystem. Throughout the hackathon, the wartime context was impossible to ignore, yet it wasn’t a shadow but a driving force. Performances by Moisei Bondarenko, the violinist-soldier whose music echoes through liberated Ukrainian cities, reminded everyone that innovation and humanity must go hand in hand. So did the tactical medicine session led by combat medic Artem Rudy, bringing practical skills and a sense of shared resilience to the room. This is what set ETHKyiv 2025 apart: it was a gathering of minds and hearts, a testament to the persistence of community, curiosity, and shared values—even in wartime. The world watched not just for the tech, but for the spirit of resilience and solidarity that Ukraine’s builders brought to the stage.

REUTERS/Stephane Mahe By Kat Hidalgo and Silas Brown Aug 1, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Terminal Investment Ltd., the port operator controlled by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte, raised $2.5 billion through a privately-placed bond sale. The debt sale by the company, known as TiL, was split between seven, 10-, 12- and 20-year maturities, and ranks among the bigger private placements so far this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The package was denominated in both dollars and euros, they said. Citigroup Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. arranged the deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Citigroup declined to comment, Mizuho Financial Group, TiL and spokespeople for Gianluigi Aponte didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

There is no question that 2025 has been a good year—so far—for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), garnering significant amounts of capital every week. While the investment products struggled at the start of the year, as did most of the global financial markets, the United States ETF market had a remarkable performance in the past quarter. Interestingly, July marked the start of another productive quarter for the crypto ETFs in the United States, with the investment products posting capital inflows in the month. According to the latest market data, July 2025 might be the best month yet for the digital asset-linked funds after registering tens of billions of dollars in capital influx in the 30-day period. On Friday, August 1, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas took to the social media platform X to reveal that the US crypto ETF market just had its best monthly performance yet in July 2025. According to the latest market data, the investment products took in more than $12.8 billion in capital—at a pace of $600 million per day—in the past month. To put into perspective, the pace of daily additions in July is about twice the average of the crypto exchange-traded funds. According to Balchunas, the digital asset-linked investment products outperformed every single ETF, including “the mighty VOO”—referring to Vanguard’s S&P 500 fund—over the past month. Balchunas added: Further, every ETF in category took in cash (ex the converted Trusts) w/ Bitcoin and Ether making equal contributions. Most all-around dominant performance since the Eagles ended the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Will be hard to top. The US crypto ETF market is led by the Bitcoin spot ETFs, with a total asset of over $146.48 billion currently under management. The Bitcoin ETF is completely dominated by BlackRock’s IBIT, which has its total assets under management (AUM) at over $84 billion, and is followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at almost $23 billion. Meanwhile, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds, which launched more than 6 months after their BTC counterparts, have a total AUM of $20.1 billion. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock also leads this market, with its ETH ETF (ETHA) having a total of $10.71 billion in assets under management. According to data from CoinGecko, the total crypto market capitalization stands at around $3.78 billion, having declined by 5% in the past 24 hours. On Friday, the crypto market succumbed to massive bearish pressure, with the top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana suffering major losses. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.
