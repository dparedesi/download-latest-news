The US Department of Justice says it expressed concerns directors’ positions on two company boards violated Clayton Act. Two directors of Fortnite creator Epic Games who were appointed by Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings have resigned their positions in the wake of an antitrust investigation in the United States. The US Department of Justice said in a statement on Wednesday that it had “expressed concerns” that the directors’ positions on both the Epic and Tencent boards were in violation of the Clayton Act because Tencent owns Riot Games, a Los Angeles-based video game developer and e-sports organiser. Section 8 of the Clayton Act “prohibits directors and officers from serving simultaneously on the boards of competitors, subject to limited exceptions”, according to the Justice Department. “Scrutiny around interlocking directorates continues to be an enforcement priority for the Antitrust Division,” said Deputy Director of Civil Enforcement Miriam R Vishio of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Epic Games and the US Justice Department did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. “Our relationship with Epic has always centred on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers. We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision,” Tencent said in an emailed statement. Beyond Fortnite, Epic Games is also known as the developer of the Unreal Engine, a groundbreaking 3D video game engine. The North Carolina-based Epic Games is privately held, but Tencent holds a minority stake in the company among its “equity investments” in other video game and media companies, according to the Justice Department. Other Epic Games investors include Sony, Disney, Fidelity and BlackRock. Tencent, one of the largest multimedia companies in the world, is incorporated and domiciled in the Cayman Islands but has its headquarters in China’s Shenzhen. The Justice Department’s statement did not mention any national security concerns around Tencent or its Chinese ownership, in contrast to the US government’s approach to other Chinese tech companies, such as ByteDance, which owns the social media platform TikTok. The video-sharing app is due to be banned in the US from January 19 if its Chinese owner ByteDance does not sell the platform. Following the investigation, Tencent decided to “amend its shareholder agreement with Epic to relinquish its unilateral right to appoint directors or observers to the Epic board in the future,” according to the Justice Department. The statement also said that despite the resignation of the two unnamed directors, “no company or individual has admitted to liability in connection with this investigation”.

Perplexity AI reportedly closed a $500 million funding round earlier this month. The round tripled the artificial intelligence (AI) startup’s valuation to $9 billion, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Dec. 18), citing an unnamed source. Reached by PYMNTS, Perplexity declined to comment on the report. The company’s backers include SoftBank, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the report. Perplexity AI started 2024 with a valuation of $520 million. During the summer, it was valued at $3 billion. HSBC Innovation Capital said Monday (Dec. 16) that 42% of U.S. venture capital was invested into AI companies in 2024 — up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022 — and that as of 2024, 20 AI companies have each raised $2 billion or more. “Venture capital has always gravitated toward transformative industries, but the level of consolidation we’re seeing within one category is unprecedented,” HSBC U.S. Innovation Banking Head Dave Sabow said in a Monday press release. BlackRock said Dec. 7 that it expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity, with the AI boom playing a major role in those investments. “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC. Perplexity said in November that it launched an AI-powered shopping assistant in the U.S. and plans to expand it to additional markets. The new Buy With Pro is available to Perplexity Pro users and helps shoppers both research and purchase products. In October, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said that the AI search company is serving over 100 million queries per week and aims to boost that figure to 100 million queries every day. Srinivas also said in October that Perplexity wants to form revenue-sharing partnerships with news publishers. He added that the company could supply publishers with chatbots that would respond to users’ queries on the publishers’ websites, using their content to provide answers. His comments came two days after Perplexity was sued by two News Corp-owned publishers that allege that the company’s AI search engine uses their copyrighted content to answer users’ questions and takes traffic that otherwise would have gone to the publishers’ sites. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Deutsche Bank to develop Ethereum layer-2 blockchain to tackle TradFi compliance issues

Project Dama 2 aims to address regulatory concerns by offering secure layer-2 blockchain solutions for financial institutions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Deutsche Bank is building a layer-2 blockchain based on Ethereum to solve the regulatory hurdles financial institutions face using public blockchains, Bloomberg News reported on Dec. 17. The platform, dubbed Project Dama 2, represents the German banking giant’s attempt to harness blockchain technology’s potential while minimizing risks associated with public ledgers, which can often inadvertently transact with sanctioned entities or criminals. The project, unveiled in November as a pilot, is designed to streamline asset servicing. It leverages ZKsync’s zero-knowledge proof (zkp) technology to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions. Moreover, using zkp will enable enhanced privacy and customization for institutional users developing on Deutsche Bank’s proprietary blockchain. Crypto firms Memento Blockchain and Interop Labs are aiding the platform’s development. Notably, Project Dama 2 is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian, which signals a growing interest among traditional financial players in blockchain-based asset servicing and tokenization solutions. JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain in late 2022, also as part of Project Guardian, while Visa is exploring the tokenization of fiat currencies for traditional banks. Meanwhile, traditional finance giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have tokenized money funds with a combined market cap of over $1 billion. Public blockchains offer immense efficiency for regulated lenders. Ethereum is the favored infrastructure by institutions, as it dominates 81% of the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). However, the report pointed out that these benefits come with uncertainty over who validates transactions, the possibility of transaction fees reaching sanctioned entities, and the risk of unforeseen blockchain hard forks that could disrupt operations. The solution found by Deutsche Bank was adding its own layer-2 blockchain to the mix. Boon-Hiong Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, stated: “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied.” As a result, Project Dama 2 connects to Ethereum while allowing the bank to sidestep some of the alleged risks inherent in public blockchains. By creating a curated list of transaction validators and offering tools to give regulators exclusive “super admin rights,” the bank hopes to provide a more secure and compliant blockchain experience.

Title: Is Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI) the Best News and Digital Media Stock to Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gannett-co-inc-gci-best-210247453.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best News and Digital Media Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) stands against other news and digital media stocks to buy now. Digital experiences comprise a significant part of consumers’ lives in today’s digital age. According to Deloitte, consumers spend an average of eight hours engaging in online activities every day, which makes up about half of their waking hours. These trends are more prominent among Gen Z and millennials, who spend around nine hours on average on online activities every day. In contrast, Gen X and boomers spend around seven and six hours on average daily, respectively. Around 7 in 10 respondents claim that they go online daily to use social media, carry out general web browsing, or communicate with their friends and family. 74% of Gen Z and millennials check their social media several times every day, with 20% of Gen Z checking their feeds at least every hour. In contrast, 57% of Gen X and 39% of boomers check their social media multiple times a day. 61% of consumers surveyed said that they interact with digital media daily by consuming entertainment (watching movies, sports, or television) on a streaming service. Similarly, around 48% said they listen to a podcast or music daily. A study by Deloitte shows that US households spent around $760 on average on acquiring connected devices in 2024, down from $800 in 2023. Consumer technology spending fell between 2022 and 2023, primarily due to pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. However, estimates show that this spending is expected to bounce back, experiencing a 1% growth in revenue in 2024 and an extra 4.4% growth in 2025. Deloitte’s 2024 Connected Consumer Survey corroborates this claim, as it shows that 28% of respondents have plans to increase their device spending in 2025, up from 9% in 2023. In contrast, around 23% of people are planning to reduce their device purchase spending, up from 7% in 2023. This trend is attributed to the ongoing financial pressures on US consumers. Recent Pew Research Center surveys show a falling number of US adults who follow the news closely. Consumers for several older types of news media, such as local television stations, public radio, and newspapers, are dwindling as well. However, audiences for a few particular media brands are increasing, including newer digital platforms such as podcasts and social media. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, nearly 50% of all US adults claimed that they sometimes get news from social media. Although those who use social media to get news like various things about it, such as speed, convenience, and preciseness, some consumers express concerns about the practice. They claim news attained from social media isn’t always accurate, is seldom low in quality, and tends to be politically biased. Inaccuracy is increasingly becoming the most disliked aspect of social media news, going from 31% who said the same to 40% in the past five years. Similarly, an Ernst & Young (EY) report on key entertainment and media trends for 2024 showed that consumer dissatisfaction with paying for unused television channels was leading to the rise of streaming services. Such services allowed households to personalize their content and reduce costs simultaneously. Media companies are now facing the challenge of maintaining a profitable balance between traditional cable and linear broadcast networks and streaming platforms. Digital media companies are also employing artificial intelligence to regulate their operations, boosting incremental growth and productivity. However, risks regarding the implementation of GenAI persist. These include intellectual property protection, creative industries’ job security concerns, and privacy and accuracy challenges. To compile our list, we consulted online sources and ETFs to select 15 top news and digital media stocks. We then chose the top 12 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI) is a diversified media company that operates through the Newsquest, Domestic Gannett Media, and Digital Marketing Solutions (DMS) segments. The Domestic Gannett Media segment operates USA TODAY. The company operates the Newsquest segment in the UK, which comprises more than 220 digital news and media brands across its portfolio. This includes over 150 weekly and daily newspapers and over 70 magazines. Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI) also offers digital advertising and marketing solutions. The company’s digital revenue categories saw strong growth in fiscal Q3 2024. As a result, its total digital revenues surpassed 45% of total revenues, marking an all-time high for the company. It also generated around $20 million of free cash flow, showing a 168% increase compared to 2023. Gannett Co.’s (NYSE:GCI) audience also experienced growth in fiscal Q3 2024, surpassing 200 million average monthly unique visitors for the first time in the company’s history. This reflects a 7% growth compared to 2023. The primary drivers of audience growth for the company in fiscal Q3 2024 included political events, the kickoff to football season, and the Paris Olympics. The company’s digital-only subscription business is also bringing new highs. Its revenue surpassed $50 million in fiscal Q3 2024, and the average digital-only revenue per unit (ARPU) exceeded $8. Investors are bullish on the stock as this segment suggests considerable upside for the company through both pricing and volume growth. Fiscal Q3 2024 marked the company’s second consecutive quarter of year-over-year subscription growth, along with another quarter of sequential growth in digital-only paid subscriptions. Miller Deep Value Select Strategy stated the following regarding Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, our two largest positive contributors were Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI), whose market share price up 20% and United Natural Foods (UNFI), with a market share price up 31%. Gannett continues to make progress with their long-term transformation to a digital media company. Management expects digital revenues to become more than 50% of company sales over the coming year which would support the company’s return to annual revenue growth. In September, the DOJ presented a very strong case against Google for their Ad Tech business. Gannett’s anti-trust case against Google is very similar to the DOJ case, and we believe it remains overlooked by the marketplace. Gannett is being represented by Kellogg Hansen who won the two largest anti-trust verdicts ($1.2B and $1.3B) and were also successful in defending the appeals of those verdicts. While it is impossible to know with certainty the outcome of Gannet’s legal case, we find it interesting that Kellogg Hansen’s only compensation is tied to Gannett having success in winning their case. This is an important indication of alignment to us. In a scenario where Gannett wins a verdict in the neighborhood of the amount they are seeking, it may mean a windfall greater than all the net debt on the balance sheet. Assuming, as we do, that the current share price has not priced in such a development, the result would be a share price below two times normalized Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA). Compared with The New York Times, which currently trades at greater than nineteen times EV/EBITDA, a valuation at half of that multiple on normalized EBITDA would support an equity market cap more than $4B for Gannett. While there are risks of temporary setbacks with multi-year transformations, the current market valuation framework appears to remain focused on the company’s historical secular growth challenges. The biggest near-term risk would be unexpected weaker trends in print advertising, creating greater near-term secular revenue headwinds. A successful transformation, positive anti-trust case verdict, and potential non-core asset sale could lead to significant upside over time. We believe the shares remain significantly mispriced at only .3 times revenue and greater than 40% normalized free cash low yield.” Overall, GCI ranks 10th on our list of the best news and digital media stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GCI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) stands against the other best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the international entertainment and media industry was valued at $2.51 trillion in 2023. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to reach $3.55 trillion by 2028. Growth in the entertainment industry is driven by the rapid adoption of subscription models, the evolution of live events, and the use of augmented and virtual reality technologies. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. A report published by FTI Delta earlier this year highlighted some significant trends and challenges in the media and entertainment industry. As per the report, the live entertainment sector has experienced a robust recovery, with global spending on live music in 2023 increasing by 49% compared to 2019. Major sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLS, NHL, and IndyCar, have not only recovered but surpassed pre-pandemic attendance levels. The post-pandemic recovery within the industry has not been uniform. For instance, the filmed entertainment industry faced severe challenges in late 2023 due to strikes by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA. These disruptions led to a more than 70% decline in production and marketing expenditures, compounding existing issues from early 2023 when studios were already tightening budgets. As a result, spending in 2023 was down approximately 35% from 2022, reflecting a struggling market. The report anticipates recovery for filmed entertainment post-strike to be more subdued than previous rebounds, with projections of about 25% year-over-year growth in 2024. On the bright side, the report highlighted a significant growth trajectory for United States TV and connected TV (CTV) advertising, emphasizing the transformative impact of CTV on the advertising landscape. The combined US TV and CTV ad spending is projected to approach $100 billion by 2027, with CTV being the primary driver of this growth. In 2024 alone, CTV advertising is expected to increase by $5.5 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. The surge in CTV advertising is largely attributed to the rise of premium ad-supported streaming services. In addition to a robust performance expected within the advertising segment, the gaming sector remains resilient. The video game industry achieved a CAGR of 9.2% from 2019 to 2022. Despite a 6.3% decline from the peak surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, console sales in 2022 remained 18% higher than pre-pandemic levels, indicating strong ongoing demand for gaming hardware. As per the report, the overall outlook for the video game market remains positive, with expectations of above mid-single-digit growth throughout the next year. A luxurious casino entrance surrounded by lush landscaping and vibrant lights. To compile the list of the 10 best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts, we used the Finviz stock screener and our previous articles. Using these two sources we aggregated an initial list of entertainment stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we checked analysts’ upside potential for each stock and shortlisted stocks with an analyst upside potential of at least 25%. Lastly, we ranked our stocks in ascending order of the analysts’ upside potential. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database. Please note that the data was collected on December 13, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Analysts’ Upside Potential: 41.85% Number of Hedge Funds: 67 Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) is a major company in the casino and entertainment industry in the United States. It owns and operates over 50 casinos across the United States, primarily under well-known brands like Caesars, Harrah’s, and Horseshoe. The company runs hotels connected to its casinos, providing approximately 44,900 hotel rooms. It also hosts numerous live events such as concerts and shows at its properties, enhancing the overall guest experience beyond just gaming. In the third quarter of 2024, Caesars Digital, the online gaming and sports betting division of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), showcased growth and performance. The segment reported $303 million in net revenues, marking a 41% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This reflects a strong demand for digital gaming and sports betting services. The segment also achieved a record adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, a significant rise from just $2 million in Q3 2023. Moreover, within the digital segment, the Caesars Palace app has been growing as a key contributor to overall iCasino revenues, highlighting the effectiveness of its mobile strategy. Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has launched the Horseshoe Casino brand in multiple states including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with plans to expand into Ontario and New Jersey by year-end. It is one of the best entertainment stocks according to analysts. Choice Equities Capital Management stated the following regarding Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) and GENI – Both Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and Genius Sports Limited operate in and around the entertainment, casino and gaming space. Caesars is a bit more well-known and discussed in brief below. Caesars Entertainment is the owner of a strong casino and entertainment brand, with a diverse portfolio of properties strategically focused on both physical and digital growth. The company’s leadership in the U.S. casino and resort industry is underpinned by its expansive footprint, including marquee properties on the Las Vegas strip, new and existing regional casinos in growing markets, and its growing Caesars Sportsbook platform. With the ongoing recovery in leisure and travel post-pandemic, combined with the secular tailwinds in online sports betting and iGaming, Caesars is well-positioned to capture growth across multiple segments. Recently emerging from a sizeable multi-year investment cycle, shares of Caesars look attractive on a mid-teens yield of forward cash-flows. Some recent refinancings and a share buyback highlight the improved look of the company’s financials.” Overall, CZR ranks 4th on our list of best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CZR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CZR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer Crowned PayPal (PYPL) as the New King of FinTech: Why It’s Poised for Big Gains

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the Jim Cramer Just Discussed These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. As the Federal Reserve exits the year by having continued its interest rate cuts, Wall Street is wondering what 2025 will hold for markets. Inflation is a key concern among investors, and many believe that the Fed might have to update its models that determine the rate cuts. This update will account for any potential uptick in inflation and one which might be spurred by tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump Administration. In a fresh episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer commented on what might happen once the interest rate cuts intensify and how these effects might tie in with Trump's strategies. Cramer doesn't "understand that people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." According to him if the tariffs go through then the CPI can rise which will lead the Fed to not cut interest rates. But, if the tariffs don't materialize or if "they're targetted tariffs, and we get break in housing, I mean we just saw Tol Brothers, I know it's only one million dollar house and not a hundred and fifty, but it starts somewhere. And we get some more apartments come in and we have big inventories from more than Ford." In the event the CPI rises, Cramer believes that "A year we'll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that's over." As a result, he believes that it is important to focus on "what the President-elect is gonna do. Why do we have to focus so much on what's going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?" Cramer also believes that the US needs more workers. Commenting on Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son announcing $100 billion in investments at Trump's Mar-e-Lago resort, Cramer stated "I think the most important thing is we don't have the workers for this stuff." He added "The idea that we get the workers, and we do not have a good birth rate, robust birth rate, we do not have enough workers, we're gonna have immigration reform. You know you wanna create jobs, what you need are people to fill them and we don't have it." Another matter that's caught Cramer's attention when it comes to the President-elect is Trump's remarks about taking on healthcare benefit managers once he assumes power. During a press conference at Mar-e-Lago, the President-elect shared that Americans were "paying far too much,. . . .much more than other countries" for healthcare. He added "We have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don't do anything except they're a middleman." Trump says that his team will "knock out the middle man [AND HE'S] going to be very unpopular after that." According to Cramer, "I think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress," as "when you have that kind of come together over them, you don't wanna be in that business." Cramer commented on the impact the President-elect's comments had and can have on the pharma benefits management industry. According to him "these companies are not, uh, without their friends. And by the way, they all resent the middlemen. Cardinal's had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. McKesson is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product." Craner added that "the drug will all give you some great data which shows you that they are not the cause of the inflation. But they always are willing to finger, uh, United Health," and as for the environment surrounding healthcare benefit managers, "right now, I've never seen it this bad for them."

For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 90 PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology company that enables users to access alternative banking systems to make transactions. Its exposure to consumer payments means that the firm relies on economic health and spending to boost transaction volume for higher commissions. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s 400 million users worldwide not only provide the firm with a wide moat but also a sizable user base to monetize. The firm is currently leveraging user data to generate advertising revenue. Cramer believes that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best plays in the financial technology sector: "Well, I was going to give you one that, that David introduced me to, that is, I'm crowning the new king of fintech, Paypal.

Overall, PYPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer just discussed.

Title: Three Predictions For 2025

Time Published: 2024-12-18T17:45:49Z

No one can argue with 2024 being a breakthrough year for crypto. BTC and ETH ETFs launched, BlackRock spearheaded bitcoin adoption, a pro-crypto president was elected and BTC broke the 15-year all-time-high, to name a few. But the inflection point for crypto still awaits. Here are three predictions for 2025 that can help spark it: You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. 1. DeFi is about to skyrocket DeFi is becoming more complex, much like traditional finance, in terms of its product suite. We’ve already seen this trend emerging with the adoption of products like Pendle, Ethena, EtherFi and Lombard. In 2025, DeFi usage will explode, with a wave of adoption for products such as options, swaps, and other derivatives like the interest rate swap market — the latter’s market size is at 465.9 trillion USD in TradFi. Moreover, new institutional players are entering the crypto ecosystem, nurturing a new category: On-chain finance. Participation is no longer limited to buying blue-chip cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. These market participants also actively expand on-chain market depth by using tools such as lending markets and liquidity provision with RWA-backed digital assets, i.e. stablecoins. Securitize and BlackRock are great examples of companies pushing the frontier on this front. DeFi is almost back to its all-time-high, Source: https://defillama.com/ 2. Stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto killer use case Stablecoins aren’t just another crypto product; they’re poised to become the digital backbone of the global financial system. Tether is the most profitable crypto company with a $5.2 billion profit in H1 2024, surpassing BlackRock. The political landscape is shifting dramatically in favour of stablecoins, with Operation Choke Point 2.0 coming to an end. They are finally being viewed as a national asset that can strengthen the dominance of the U.S. dollar and address growing public debt. This shift also paves the way for major banks and payment companies like Visa and Mastercard to expand their efforts in the sector, especially when you consider Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion (the biggest acquisition in crypto ever) and rumors of Revolut launching its stablecoin. Stablecoins market cap is at an All-Time-High already at about $200 billion, Source: https://defillama.com/stablecoins 3. The race for retail adoption ETFs will be key drivers for new capital to enter crypto. BTC ETFs are here, and soon we’ll see the success of Ethereum ETFs. After SOL’s undeniable growth over the last year, the SOL ETF will either catch the momentum and become a reality in the first half of 2025 or will delay until 2026 or later. We’ll also see major Web3 social platforms compete with the LensChain mainnet launch and Farcaster’s further expansion. As the pie grows bigger, we can end up with the "Twitter/X and Facebook of crypto" platforms. Notably, “Super Wallets” took off in Q4 2024. They aim to offer a comprehensive alternative to centralized exchanges for new users. The leading players are Infinex, launched by Kain Warwick, and DeFiApp, launched by seasoned builders in DeFi. Both are working on UX problems, something we have never done very well as an industry. Bonus prediction: MiCA will power crypto expansion in Europe Crypto regulations provide the foundations for new projects. They lay the groundwork for clear rules and guidelines of organizational structure. MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) attempts to bring just that with an aim to increase the importance of EUR-related assets. This could potentially bridge crypto innovation between the U.S. and Europe.

Title: Is The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) the Best Cash-Rich Dividend Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) stands against the other cash-rich dividend stocks. Cash remains a critical asset, as companies with strong cash reserves tend to attract investors regardless of the economic climate. A robust cash position allows businesses to enhance shareholder value through activities such as paying dividends, buying back shares, or pursuing strategic acquisitions. That said, cash has underperformed compared to other assets, but with yields at their highest in years and economic and inflation uncertainty, many people have chosen to keep their extra funds in money markets, certificates of deposit, high-yield savings accounts, and Treasury bills. A survey conducted in July by Empower found that 49% of Americans felt more secure holding cash than other investments. The survey, which polled 1,009 US adults, also found that cash made up more than 27% of respondents' portfolios. However, financial experts like Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, generally recommend keeping only 3% to 5% of a portfolio in cash for emergencies and liquidity needs. Also read: 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy The US financial markets are currently supported by an enormous pool of liquidity, with substantial funds held in money market accounts and other short-term investments. According to T. Rowe Price, US money market funds alone managed nearly $6 trillion in assets as of mid-December 2023—an increase of over 60% since December 2019, just before the onset of the pandemic. As of the week ending December 4, a record $6.77 trillion is held in money market funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. This amount is nearly half a trillion dollars higher than the funds held in September before the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut in four years, followed by another in November. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group noted that corporate cash reserves have steadily grown since the pandemic began. The ongoing strength of the economy has enabled companies to set aside more funds and earn returns on short-term investments. As of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, driven by a robust economy and relatively high interest rates, which enhanced returns. This represents a 12.6% increase from the same period last year and $1.28 trillion more than pre-pandemic levels. Despite market volatility driven by high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, corporate financial health has remained strong, showing resilience in the first half of the year. According to Bloomberg data, nearly 1 in 10 non-financial companies in the broader market—over 30 firms—earned more in interest income than they spent on debt expenses in the first quarter. While this figure has remained consistent with the previous year, the interest income generated by these companies has increased by approximately 60%. Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy for Bank of America Corp.’s securities business, made the following comment about the situation: “Corporates are earning more money by holding cash. Many companies are comfortable with where the economy is as well as with elevated cash levels because they are getting a return for it.” Wells Fargo suggested that income investors might consider dividend-paying stocks, noting that US large-cap companies have amassed over $2.4 trillion in cash on their balance sheets and could opt to start or increase dividend payouts. Our Methodology: For this article, we began by using a stock screener to find companies with a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio below 15. From this list, we selected companies with a market capitalization of at least $20 billion. Next, we focused on companies with the highest trailing twelve-month operating cash flows, ranking the stocks in ascending order based on their TTM operating cash flows. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A closeup of an assembly line worker inspecting a newly produced jar of condiments and sauces. Operating Cash Flow (TTM): $4.15 billion The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ranks sixth on our list of the cash-rich stocks that pay dividends. The American food company specializes in a wide range of snacks and beverages. The company delivered mixed earnings in the third quarter of 2024, despite having fallen short of investor expectations since its 2015 merger. In the third quarter of 2024, reported $6.38 billion in revenue, reflecting a 2.85% decline compared to the same period last year. However, the company’s gross profit margin improved by 20 basis points to 34.2%. Kraft Heinz continued to prioritize investments in marketing, research and development, and technology to deliver value-driven solutions for consumers and drive future revenue growth. These efforts are supported by its proven ability to optimize operations and maintain strong cash flow. In addition, the company remains committed to growing its established and emerging food and beverage brands on a global scale. Mairs & Power also highlighted efforts made by The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “We added The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) to the Fund in the quarter. Kraft Heinz is a leading global food company which possesses a portfolio of iconic brands, including its eponymous ketchup brand. The company has been undergoing an operational transformation focused on driving efficiency gains in supply chain, manufacturing and distribution. These efficiency gains have fueled increased investments in technology, automation, innovation and marketing, which should ultimately drive more consistent organic revenue growth and high single digit earnings per share growth. We expect above-average long-term returns, buoyed by consistent free cash flow generation, opportunistic share repurchases and an attractive 4-5% dividend yield. A modest current valuation affords an ample margin of safety.” Income investors can find reassurance in the company’s strong cash position and set aside other concerns. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) reported a solid cash generation in its latest quarter. Year-to-date operating cash flow rose to $2.8 billion, a 6.7% increase from the same period last year. Free cash flow totaled $2 billion, reflecting a 9.7% year-over-year growth. In addition, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends over the first nine months of the year. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 5.17%, as of December 16. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3 2024. In addition, Arrowstreet Capital increased its stake in the company by 31% during Q3. Overall, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) was included in 38 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database, with a total stake value amounting to over $12 billion. Overall KHC ranks 6th on our list of the cash-rich dividend stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of KHC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KHC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2025 Predictions: Bitcoin, Sovereigns And Macro

BATH, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 05: In this photo illustration a novelty Bitcoin token is ... [+] photographed on a US Dollar bank note, on November 5, 2023 in Bath, England. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, cryptocurrency analysts say millions of US dollars has so far been donated to the Ukrainian war effort through anonymous Bitcoin donations, with the Ukrainian government, and many NGOs and volunteer groups all advertising their Bitcoin wallet addresses online. However, fears have also been raised that the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, maybe used by the Russian government to circumnavigate the tough economic sanctions that have been imposed. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) There’s a new incoming administration in the U.S. that has promised a lot of changes to the status quo in 2025. Because of this, the global financial ecosystem should look very different by the end of the year. Based on plans that have already been announced, and considering the knock-on effects that they will have, we can start to paint a picture of what that future could look like, and draw some predictions of what is to come. Here are my top 5 Bitcoin and macro predictions for the year ahead, and how they could impact markets: Bitcoin will reach the price equivalent of 50 Oz of gold: Gold currently trades at $2,650/oz, and bitcoin trades at $106,000. At the time of writing, it takes ~40 Oz of gold to buy one bitcoin. I believe bitcoin will continue to appreciate in gold terms, and will reach a price equivalent to 50 oz of gold. At current gold prices, this would equate to a BTC price of $132,500. In other words, Bitcoin will increase in value as measured in gold, not just as measured in dollars. I expect to see a slew of portfolio recommendations coming out of ETF issuers’ research desks and registered investment advisors, recommending a portfolio allocation for bitcoin. Not dissimilar to the one that was recently published by Blackrock. The recent report from Blackrock about bitcoin stated “investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.”. If you are a fully allocated investor looking to rotate into a bitcoin position, you may be inclined to downsize your gold position to make room, as you’re investing the “digital” version of it. At least one G20 country will propose a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: While everyone in the Bitcoin community is rightfully excited about the potential of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the geopolitical dominos have started falling, and they will continue to fall whether the U.S. pulls the trigger or not. Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan already have bitcoin reserves, and their reserves have appreciated materially over recent years. Healthy financial reserves that are uncensorable and have no counterparty risk means more geopolitical leverage for a nation state. Others will want to replicate this success. There are several recent examples of presidential candidates running on a “Bitcoin” platform in countries like Suriname and Poland, and there’s been Bitcoin Reserves proposals already submitted in countries like Brazil and Japan. I believe at least one more G20 country will announce plans for a Bitcoin Strategic reserve during 2025. Bitcoin Miner Crackdown: As countries begin to understand the strategic significance of stacking bitcoin, they will turn their heads into how it is produced, and will learn that underutilized or underproductive energy sources can be tapped into to generate bitcoin. In parallel, they will look at those currently mining bitcoin domestically for public private partnerships. I expect to see the creation of regulatory bodies to oversee bitcoin mining in several countries. I also expect to see some countries aggressively going after “unregistered” miners that don’t comply with their regime or rules. We saw this happen in Venezuela last year, we could see similar behaviour in other countries throughout 2025. U.S. Dollar Stablecoin Surge: Between Circle and Tether combined, they hold approximately $136 Billion in U.S. debt today, which makes them the 18th largest holder of U.S. debt in the world. USD stablecoins can grow into very large buyers of U.S. debt at a time when the Federal Reserve is desperately looking to deleverage its balance sheet (i.e. they need to sell some of their bond holdings). And they are always looking for buyers to roll over their debt. I expect the Trump administration to recognize this and quickly move to regulate U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins like Circle and Tether to solidify them as a sort of strategic partners that can help the U.S. drive further penetration of the U.S. dollar, and be active buyers of U.S. national debt. This environment should allow for the market capitalization for USD-pegged stablecoins to more than double from ~$200 B today to ~$500 B by the end of 2025. The Euro will trade below par to the USD: There are many layers to this reasoning and prediction, but let’s focus on macro and crypto drivers for now. Generally speaking, the EU is growing at a much slower rate than the U.S. in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) terms. Year to date, the EU has grown by +0.8%, whereas the U.S. has grown by +2.8%. Because of this, analysts predict that the EU will have to cut interest rates more aggressively than the U.S. Federal Reserve during 2025. This will put pressure on the Euro. Further, looking at it from a crypto lens, the highly anticipated MiCA crypto regulatory framework will become active in the EU on December 30th 2024. While there are positives to having regulatory clarity for the industry, along with clear investor and consumer protections for users, the ruleset can be complex and expensive for a young startup to comply with. In parallel, the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. has signalled a pro-crypto shift in the U.S. regulatory bodies, and it has reinvigorated a conversation among founders in the space to relocate back to the U.S. or set up operations in the country. This could draw future innovation and investment from Europe in the crypto sector, adding to further weakness in the Euro. While the Euro has traded above the U.S. dollar over the last 20 years or so, I would not be surprised to see another multi-year period where it trades below the U.S. dollar. That’s my top 5 for 2025. We’ll keep an eye on markets and I’ll be back next December to see how we did! One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Is Jantzi Social Index ETF (XEN) the Best Canadian ETF to Buy?

Time Published: 2024-12-18T14:47:14Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Canadian ETFs to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Jantzi Social Index ETF (TSX:XEN) stands against other best Canadian ETFs to buy. After a slow start in 2024, the Canadian stock market saw a strong third quarter, fueled by domestic rate cuts and a recovery in global markets. Year-over-year headline inflation has cooled to align with the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. As a result, policymakers have implemented four consecutive rate cuts, with an additional 50 basis point reduction anticipated in December. With the central bank expected to keep cutting interest rates to support the economy, stock market strategists are cautiously optimistic that the rally will continue. In this context, Brent Joyce, chief investment strategist at BMO, shared the following: “The environment is very attractive for equities. It’s been this trifecta of better global growth, interest-rate-sensitive companies themselves, and the interest rate sensitivity of dividends. These were headwinds for the two years that rates were going up, [but they] have flipped into tailwinds for the Canadian stock market now that rates are falling.” While most stocks are influenced by global factors, many companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange are also cyclically driven, meaning their performance is closely tied to the economy and the business cycle. Given the strong connection between the US and Canadian economies, stable growth in the US has provided a boost to Canadian equities. On that front, Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, advises clients to allocate 5% of their equity portfolio to Canadian stocks, making it the second-largest weighting after the 69% recommended for US stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is on track to have its best year since 2009, having set new records 42 times this year and risen 21.09% year-to-date, closely following the S&P 500’s 27.58% gain. Hayes highlighted the broad rally and noted that the market is largely driven by energy and financial stocks, which offer the highest trailing and forward earnings yields, contrasting with the tech sector’s lower yields. On the other hand, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rattled the markets earlier in November with a proposal to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, aimed at addressing drug trafficking and border issues, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China. This decision had an immediate impact on Canada’s energy sector, which experienced a 2.2% decline amid concerns that rising US crude production would meet domestic demand. At the same time, the Canadian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since May 2020, sparking worries about potential inflationary pressures on imports. While the future remains uncertain, the Canadian ETF industry, which began with the world’s first ETF launched in Canada in 1990, has shown notable resilience over the past 30+ years, and continued growth is expected in the years to come. Despite the market volatility this year, Canadian ETFs have managed to navigate the challenges effectively and are well-positioned for another strong year. With only a couple of weeks remaining in the year, the industry is on track to surpass the previous annual record of $58 billion set in 2021. Moreover, following recent data from IFIC showing Canadian ETF sales reached their third-best month ever in October, a new report from research firm ETFGI highlights additional gains in November, along with impressive year-to-date figures. The firm reported net inflows of US$7.5 billion in November, slightly down from the C$8.2 billion reported in IFIC’s October report, but still a strong performance that contributes to the 29th consecutive month of net inflows. Our Methodology We have selected the top Canadian ETFs to buy and hold based on their 5-year performance as of December 10, listed in ascending order for clarity. Additionally, we’ve highlighted the top holdings of each ETF to provide valuable insights for potential investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 47.29% The iShares Jantzi Social Index ETF (TSX:XEN), managed by BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited, is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the Jantzi Social Index. The fund focuses on stocks of companies recognized for socially responsible business practices. Over the past year, XEN delivered a total return of 24.93%, with an average annual return of 6.11% since inception, including dividends. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is one of the ETF’s largest holdings. In the third quarter of 2024, the company achieved record-breaking results, producing 863,000 ounces of gold at cash costs of $921 per ounce, meeting its annual projections. The strong performance was driven by operational efficiency and cost control, enabling the company to return approximately $700 million to shareholders and reduce net debt by $1 billion, lowering it to $490 million. Revenue grew by 31% to $2.2 billion, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 64% to $1.26 billion. On November 21, Jefferies initiated coverage of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), assigning a Hold rating and an $85 price target. The firm praised the company’s robust operational performance, cost management, and high-quality asset portfolio. Additionally, margin expansion is expected as Agnico Eagle develops underground ore sources at its Canadian Malartic and Detour Lake mines, which will provide access to higher-grade materials. Overall, XEN ranks 8th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy. While we acknowledge that XEN, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (FCCQ) the Best Canadian ETF to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Canadian ETFs to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) stands against other best Canadian ETFs to buy. After a slow start in 2024, the Canadian stock market saw a strong third quarter, fueled by domestic rate cuts and a recovery in global markets. Year-over-year headline inflation has cooled to align with the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. As a result, policymakers have implemented four consecutive rate cuts, with an additional 50 basis point reduction anticipated in December. With the central bank expected to keep cutting interest rates to support the economy, stock market strategists are cautiously optimistic that the rally will continue. In this context, Brent Joyce, chief investment strategist at BMO, shared the following: “The environment is very attractive for equities. It’s been this trifecta of better global growth, interest-rate-sensitive companies themselves, and the interest rate sensitivity of dividends. These were headwinds for the two years that rates were going up, [but they] have flipped into tailwinds for the Canadian stock market now that rates are falling.” While most stocks are influenced by global factors, many companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange are also cyclically driven, meaning their performance is closely tied to the economy and the business cycle. Given the strong connection between the US and Canadian economies, stable growth in the US has provided a boost to Canadian equities. On that front, Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, advises clients to allocate 5% of their equity portfolio to Canadian stocks, making it the second-largest weighting after the 69% recommended for US stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is on track to have its best year since 2009, having set new records 42 times this year and risen 21.09% year-to-date, closely following the S&P 500’s 27.58% gain. Hayes highlighted the broad rally and noted that the market is largely driven by energy and financial stocks, which offer the highest trailing and forward earnings yields, contrasting with the tech sector’s lower yields. On the other hand, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rattled the markets earlier in November with a proposal to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, aimed at addressing drug trafficking and border issues, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China. This decision had an immediate impact on Canada’s energy sector, which experienced a 2.2% decline amid concerns that rising US crude production would meet domestic demand.

A person with a cell phone who is looking for new stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 45.75% The Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) aims to mirror the performance of the Fidelity Canada Canadian High Quality Index. As of December 9, it holds net assets of $214.4 million and has a management expense ratio of 0.39%. This ETF focuses on equity securities from large- and mid-cap Canadian companies, emphasizing higher-quality profiles compared to the broader Canadian equity market. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) holds the largest position in this Fidelity ETF. On December 4, Loop Capital upgraded the company’s stock from Hold to Buy, citing its innovative use of artificial intelligence to enhance merchant tools and optimize internal operations. The brokerage also raised its price target to $140, representing a 23% potential upside. Loop Capital emphasized that these AI-driven advancements are enabling Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) to grow revenue faster than expenses, improving operating and free cash flow margins. With consistent annual sales growth exceeding 20%, the company is well-positioned to enhance profitability and valuation further. Additionally, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) reported record-breaking Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) sales of $11.5 billion, a 24% increase from the previous year. This robust performance suggests the company is on track to meet or surpass consensus expectations for fourth-quarter Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growth, currently forecasted at 23.5%. Rowan Street Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) has been an incredibly rewarding investment for those lucky enough to get in early after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2015. The shares have delivered a return of 2,600% or 42% annual. Its revenues have grown at 49% per annum since the end of 2014 from $105 million to estimated $8.6 billion in 2024. The massive e-commerce market is a huge opportunity, as the company’s growth indicates. As you tell from the chart below, revenues are forecasted to grow above 20% for the next 3 years. Keep in mind, Shopify has been around for more than a decade — and it’s still growing at these high rates. Overall, FCCQ ranks 9th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of FCCQ, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FCCQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta Platforms (META) Challenges OpenAI’s Shift to For-Profit Status

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is focused on developing products that promote global connectivity and communication. The company is making significant investments in AI, applying it to its language models and integrating it into its AR/VR technologies. Meta (NASDAQ:META) has urged California’s attorney general to block OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit company, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. In a letter, Meta argued that allowing OpenAI to shift its business model could set a troubling precedent, enabling startups to enjoy nonprofit benefits until reaching profitability. Meta warned that this could lead to unfair advantages for investors, who would receive the same financial gains as those in traditional for-profit ventures while also benefiting from tax breaks intended for nonprofits. Overall, META ranks 3rd on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) Set to Unveil Agentforce 2.0 with Advanced AI Features and Slack Integration

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks. There is a growing concern in Silicon Valley that the progress around artificial intelligence is slowly “losing steam”. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explores whether AI progress is slowing, and what it means for the industry. Early signs of struggle are bubbling up in major tech names. As highlighted by Bosa, the first sign of things slowing down has been a lack of progression between models. OpenAI has led the pack in AI advancements, with each of the new models of ChatGPT exponentially better than the last. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about today. OpenAI's highly anticipated model Orion was expected to be a ground-breaking system bringing us closer to AGI. However, the initial vision is being scaled back. “While Orion’s performance ended up exceeding that of prior models, the increase in quality was far smaller compared with the jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the last two flagship models the company released, according to some OpenAI employees who have used or tested Orion”. The same roadblocks have been happening to other AI models, such as that by Anthropic. Just like OpenAI, Anthropic is also witnessing a timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus. "The AGI bubble is bursting a little bit. It's become clear that 'different training approaches' may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks." Even some of the big tech giants aren't enthusiastic about the progress AI has been making. Speaking during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai stated how generative AI won’t be changing lives in 2025— at least, not more than it already has. “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper ... You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. However, if progress is plateauing, it has to do with scaling laws. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei states that the scaling laws are a misnomer. He emphasizes that while these patterns have historically guided AI development—suggesting that increasing data and computational power leads to improved AI capabilities—they are not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. As such, AI companies have been turning to synthetic AI, i.e. data generated artificially. The Information reports that Orion was produced based on synthetic data. However, the problem has been that low-quality data, in turn, leads to low-quality performance. As such, with leading tech companies poised to unveil new models over the next eighteen months, their pace of progress—or lack thereof—has the potential to dramatically redefine the dynamics of the competition.

Title: Swiss fintech startup tiun raises $2.5 million to modernise media monetision

Time Published: 2024-12-18T09:55:00Z
Full Content:
tiun, a fintech helping media providers to attract, engage and convert younger audiences, is today announcing a $2.5 million pre-seed funding round led by Founderful. The funds will kick-start their efforts to become Europe's preferred way to pay for online media. 0 18 December 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. In particular, the tiun team is focused on onboarding new business partnerships and integrations with third-party payment methods i.e. digital wallets. These will simultaneously provide media platforms with exposure to previously untapped audiences while also allowing a new generation of users to access and pay for media by “tiuning in”, offering more convenience and flexibility while being more secure.The tiun team believes that consuming and paying for online content should be simple and that users shouldn’t need to create a new account, give up personal information, provide credit card details and subscribe - every time they find a new media platform. Especially among young users, the tedious process of registering and subscribing is not considered “convenient” anymore. tiun offers media companies easy-to-integrate solutions that allow a new means of authentication and payment to provide world-class user experiences that drive millions of users, and increase customer spending and engagement.Swiss VC firm Founderful led the round, which also included Blue Wire Capital and a16z scout Maximilian Lehmann, among other angel investors. tiun was founded in early 2023 by the experienced co-founder trio Nikolaos Christoforakos, Christian Heiduschke and Sandro Zweig. Ex-BlackRock Zweig previously led a fintech product development agency that boasted Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank amongst its clientele. Christoforakos provides tiun with expertise in go-to-market strategies having previously helped scale teams at the likes of Amazon and Moss. Lastly, Heiduschke has almost a decade of experience in building scalable, robust SaaS products, having originally achieved a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Born out of a shared frustration at being hit with paywalls the team quickly agreed there must be an alternative, more user-friendly way of charging for media, which doesn’t require the repetitive surrendering of personal data, and began work on a solution. tiun Co-founder Nikolaos Christoforakos explains, “There’s a clear disconnect between the modern way we expect to consume media and how media is bought and paid for today. The subscription model was invented to bring convenience to consumers, preventing them from having to pay for every item they wanted to consume. This worked too for the media providers, who got consumer loyalty in return - so the model grew exponentially. That same experience can in today’s world often be a hindrance for a young user to convert and become a loyal customer. tiun intends to build that bridge by working closely with media businesses, in a way which will significantly benefit both consumers and media businesses.”tiun enters the market at a time the news media industry is in financial freefall. A lack of revenue is causing significant layoffs throughout the industry. Estimates by the Press Gazette suggest that 2,500 media jobs have been cut in the US and UK this year alone. Big-name takeovers in the US haven’t yet solved the problem, either. Over the past decade, Jeff Bezos, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, and Marc Benioff bought The Washington Post, LA Times, and Time Magazine, respectively. Despite their backing, those three publications alone lost an estimated $150 million in 2023. tiun builds the infrastructure that allows younger audiences to connect their wallet with an online service in a few clicks to access and pay for media, allowing them to pay for the time they consume. Pascal Mathis, Partner at Founderful, says, "The internet has become the dominant way by which people consume media. Be it television, printed media, the radio, or physical CDs, one by one the internet has triumphed by facilitating a smoother, simplified user experience. The one area online media has failed to address, however, is effective monetization, deterring users with inconvenient and fragmented methods. Tiun removes these hurdles, creating seamless connections between consumers and providers. We're thrilled to support the team in solving this challenge at such an early stage."The tiun team sees vast potential in the solution in all kinds of media beyond written news, including streaming, and gaming. The company has already onboarded 50+ media titles across Central Europe, which are making use of the infrastructure.The tiun infrastructure can track activity and end the session if there is no movement after a given time, preventing users from overspending. To incentivize uptake, tiun limits the amount media providers can charge users to a maximum of 20% of what a monthly subscription would cost. Once those limits are reached, the remainder of the month is free. The data and insights gathered by the platform can be used to inform media strategies to ensure media is as engaging as possible. Bertie Highmore, Head of Investments at Blue Wire Capital says, “The tiun team have extensive experience in - and demonstrated ability for - building, launching and scaling digital platforms. Strong appetite has already been shown for their product, which solves one of the biggest emerging issues in online media. We’re excited to be on board, and are looking forward to what will be a huge next twelve months for them.”The tiun team is delighted to raise its initial funding round to develop a first-of-its-kind solution to modernize the way online media providers charge for their services. The team will share a series of exciting updates in the coming year.

Stone Point’s stake will likely be in the 15% to 20% range in the secondary equity sale, which valued Ardonagh at 16 to 17 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, one of the people said. Ardonagh was last valued at $7.5 billion when Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invested in the firm in late 2021. It is majority-owned by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners. Private credit specialist HPS Investment Partners, set to be acquired by BlackRock Inc., owns a minority stake in Ardonagh. The deal is the latest in insurance broking that signals large-scale transactions are heating up in the industry, with both private equity and strategic buyers hunting for assets in the fragmented market. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co agreed to buy AssuredPartners in a $13.45 billion deal this month, its largest-ever acquisition. In September, Marsh McLennan agreed to buy McGriff Insurance Services in a $7.8 billion cash transaction, also its biggest. Founded in 2017 from the combination of broker Towergate and four other entities, London-based Ardonagh has become one of the world’s 20 largest brokers in recent years. It generated pro-forma income of $1.9 billion in 2023. Over the past three years alone, Ardonagh bought 13 businesses in markets including Brazil, Spain and Italy. This year, it bought Australia’s PSC Insurance Group for an implied equity value of A$2.3 billion ($1.5 billion), taking it private and combining it with its Envest business. Private Credit Ardonagh is also a large borrower in the $1.6 trillion private credit market, having secured what was the largest-ever loan from a group of private credit funds in 2020. Last year, Ares Management Corp. provided a direct-lending package worth about £1 billion ($1.3 billion) to support the sale of its personal insurance business to Markerstudy. Ardonagh’s latest funding is likely to prompt speculation about any next steps Howden Group, another major UK insurance broker, might take to boost growth. The company, founded by David Howden 30 years ago, has long been considered a likely candidate for an initial public offering. The firm had an enterprise value of $13 billion in 2022. It is owned by 5,200 employee-shareholders, private equity firms General Atlantic and Hg, Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec as well as the Howden Foundation.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn’t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. The United States is gearing up to be the leader in artificial intelligence technology. However, other nations are also intensifying their efforts to compete in this rapidly advancing field. To challenge the United States’ dominance in this critical technology, Russia has recently pledged to participate in the global race for artificial intelligence actively. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Speaking at Russia’s flagship AI conference last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries. According to Putin, the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states. He also claimed that the country must participate equally in the global AI race. “Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on. We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration”. Russia has been subject to Western sanctions which have been directed to restrict the country’s access to technologies it needs in the war against Ukraine. As a result, some of the world’s major producers of microchips have halted exports to Russia, limiting its AI ambitions. Reuters reports how Russia’s dominant lender Sberbank, who is currently leading the AI development in Russia, admits that the microchips underpinning AI development are the trickiest hardware to replace. In this regard, it noted how national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Serbia, Indonesia, and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network. The network will be working toward joint research in technology and AI regulation, offering opportunities for AI products to be sold in other member countries’ markets. Currently, the leading AI powers of the world are the United States and China. It goes without saying that Russia’s alliance with China has the potential to significantly reshape the future landscape of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the US is also gearing up to continue leading in AI. President-elect Donald Trump has already appointed an AI and Crypto Czar. Trump is also set to repeal President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI. Trump plans to repeal Biden’s AI order to reduce regulatory constraints, fostering rapid innovation and maintaining the U.S. edge in the global AI race.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that uses advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On December 13, Reuters reported that The Trump transition team wants the incoming administration to drop a car-crash reporting requirement opposed by Elon Musk’s Tesla. The requirement, if dropped, would weaken the government’s ability to investigate and regulate the safety of vehicles that come with automated driving systems. Tesla is going to benefit the most from the removal of this provision, as the company has reported more than 1,500 crashes to federal safety regulators under the program. This has led to multiple federal investigations. The recommendation to eliminate the rule came from a transition team that was responsible for producing a 100-day strategy for automotive policy. According to the team, the rule is considered a requirement for “excessive” data collection, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.

Title: Cardio Diagnostics Holdings, Inc. (CDIO) Secures Medicare Pricing Approval for Precision Cardiovascular Tests

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cardio Diagnostics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDIO) stands against the other AI stocks. There is a growing concern in Silicon Valley that the progress around artificial intelligence is slowly “losing steam”. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explores whether AI progress is slowing, and what it means for the industry. Early signs of struggle are bubbling up in major tech names. As highlighted by Bosa, the first sign of things slowing down has been a lack of progression between models. OpenAI has led the pack in AI advancements, with each of the new models of ChatGPT exponentially better than the last. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about today. OpenAI's highly anticipated model Orion was expected to be a ground-breaking system bringing us closer to AGI. However, the initial vision is being scaled back. “While Orion’s performance ended up exceeding that of prior models, the increase in quality was far smaller compared with the jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the last two flagship models the company released, according to some OpenAI employees who have used or tested Orion”. The same roadblocks have been happening to other AI models, such as that by Anthropic. Just like OpenAI, Anthropic is also witnessing a timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus. "The AGI bubble is bursting a little bit. It's become clear that 'different training approaches' may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks." Even some of the big tech giants aren't enthusiastic about the progress AI has been making. Speaking during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai stated how generative AI won’t be changing lives in 2025— at least, not more than it already has. “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper ... You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. However, if progress is plateauing, it has to do with scaling laws. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei states that the scaling laws are a misnomer. He emphasizes that while these patterns have historically guided AI development—suggesting that increasing data and computational power leads to improved AI capabilities—they are not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. As such, AI companies have been turning to synthetic AI, i.e. data generated artificially. The Information reports that Orion was produced based on synthetic data. However, the problem has been that low-quality data, in turn, leads to low-quality performance. As such, with leading tech companies poised to unveil new models over the next eighteen months, their pace of progress—or lack thereof—has the potential to dramatically redefine the dynamics of the competition.

A doctor delivering the results of an epigenetics-based clinical test to a patient. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 3 Cardio Diagnostics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDIO) is an AI-driven precision cardiovascular medicine company that makes heart disease prevention more accessible, personalized, and precise. On December 16, the company announced that two of their tests had received final pricing determinations from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Effective January 1, 2025, Medicare contractors will be able to determine pricing for PrecisionCHD and Epi+Gen CHD tests based on actual cost data from Cardio Diagnostics. The approval allows these tests to be accessible to the Medicare population. “Receiving this final determination is a crucial step for our innovative solutions to help improve the risk assessment, diagnosis, management and monitoring of coronary heart disease (CHD) for Medicare patients. This milestone brings us closer to addressing the significant unmet needs in cardiovascular care for the Medicare population, enabling clinicians to better personalize treatment strategies and ultimately improve patient outcomes”. Overall CDIO ranks 11th on our list of the AI stocks that are dominating Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of CDIO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a laptop with a software engineer coding on the monitor. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a cloud-based platform that offers monitoring and security solutions for applications and infrastructure. The company leverages AI to improve performance analysis, improve security management, and streamline workflows across cloud environments. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz upped his price target for Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to $170, up from $155, while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock as part of his outlook for the software sector in 2025. This adjustment reflects the broader trend of increasing valuations for several companies, driven by higher comparison multiples. Moskowitz noted: “DDOG remains a clear leader in the observability market, with multiple businesses at scale, and with potential tailwinds in the form of digital transformation, cloud migration, and GenAI.” The firm expressed a more optimistic view than many regarding cloud adoption in the coming years, mentioning both existing on-premise customers and new clients as key drivers. This was part of its detailed 2025 software sector outlook. Overall, DDOG ranks 6th on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of DDOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DDOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Economics of Investor Engagement

Institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs) play a prominent role in today’s economy. According to the CFA Institute, institutional investors now hold over $70 trillion in investable assets and thus wield immense influence over the corporations they invest in. But how do these institutions actually exercise their power? The most nuanced and direct way for investors to interact with their portfolio firms is through shareholder engagement, where they communicate with corporate managers to share their perspective, suggest changes, or gather information. In a new study, we quantify the costs, benefits, and economy-wide impact of engagement by some of the largest institutional investors in the world. Engagement activities range from writing letters to CEOs and joining meetings to pressing for better governance or environmental practices. Unlike voting or selling shares, engagement is a private dialogue, making it a less-easily observed but potentially more powerful and nuanced tool. By addressing issues directly with corporate leaders, investors aim to improve company performance – and, in turn, the value of their investments. The institutions in our sample each employs a dedicated stewardship team that engages with hundreds or even thousands of portfolio firms every year. Despite its importance, we know surprisingly little about the economics of engagement. How much does it cost? What are the benefits? How much value does it create? Using novel data on investor engagement drawn from the yearly stewardship reports of eleven large institutional investors including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and T. Rowe Price, we quantify these economic forces for the first time. We find that institutional investors act as if spending $10,000 on engagement increases a company’s value by 0.3 basis points (bps), or 0.003 percent, on average. While that may sound small, when scaled by trillions of dollars in market capitalization and assets under management, the potential benefits are significant. However, engagement isn’t free; the stewardship team requires significant resources to research the issues and conduct meetings with corporate leaders. We find that both the costs and benefits vary depending on the firm being engaged. Smaller companies are slightly more expensive to engage with but offer much higher returns on engagement, an average 5.5 basis point expected increase in firm value. Yet institutional investors engage less with smaller firms because they hold smaller positions in those firms, limiting the potential payoff. We also find that engagement costs are higher for firms with entrenched management, where presumably resistance from leadership makes it harder to drive change. The economics of engagement also depend on the type of fund that is engaging. Active funds – those that try to outperform the market by actively picking stocks – are more likely to engage than index funds, which simply aim to match the performance of an index like the S&P 500. Surprisingly, this difference isn’t because active funds are inherently better at engagement. In fact, we find that active and index funds create equal amounts of expected value when they engage. Rather, it’s a question of incentives. Index funds charge lower fees, meaning they capture a smaller share of the value created through engagement. As a result, despite their larger positions and more diversified holdings, they engage less. Yet as passive investing continues to dominate the market, the role of these funds in engagement is becoming more pronounced. Index funds tend to hold larger stakes in companies simply because of their huge size, which increases their potential to create value when they do engage. Using simulations, we examined what would happen if passive investing continued to grow, reaching 90 percent of all mutual fund assets. We find that index funds would engage more often, driven by their even larger holdings, and generate substantial value for both their investors and society. Our estimates suggest that index funds have flat economies of scale: Tracking an index does not become more difficult as the fund grows. As a result, the continuing rise of passive investing increases the total societal benefits of their engagement. On the other hand, our estimates show that active investors face diseconomies of scale that limit their effectiveness as they grow. As an actively managed fund attracts more resources, it becomes harder to identify and act on profitable opportunities that move the needle. As Warren Buffett once said, “Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money.” Smaller active funds can engage more selectively and effectively. In our simulations, active funds actually create more value for society when they shrink. At the same time, active fund managers and investors certainly don’t want their funds to shrink, and we might expect them to fight this trend, for example by lowering their fees or introducing new active investing options. Our findings add new dimensions to the debate about the future of investing and corporate governance. Engagement clearly has the potential to create significant value, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. Index funds, with their flat economies of scale, may increasingly fill the gap left by shrinking active funds, creating a system where the societal value of engagement could rise even if the payoff to individual funds and investors are smaller. The study also highlights the challenges of aligning private incentives with social benefits. While active funds are more motivated to engage under current fee structures, index funds generate broader social gains as they grow. This mismatch creates a tension between what’s best for active fund managers and their investors and what’s best for the economy as a whole. More broadly, our findings imply that engagement is a relatively hidden but powerful tool for increasing firm value – one that benefits not just large institutions, but the broader economy, too. As the balance between active and passive investing shifts, so will the dynamics of how institutional investors engage with the companies they own. This post comes to us from professors Davidson Heath at the University of Utah’s David Eccles School of Business, Daniele Macciocchi at the University of Miami’s Herbert Business School, and Matthew C. Ringgenberg at the University of Utah. It is based on their recent article, “The Economics of Investor Engagement,” available here. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Introducing Nirvana V2: Here's What You Need to Know | HackerNoon
URL: https://hackernoon.com/introducing-nirvana-v2-heres-what-you-need-to-know
Time Published: 2024-12-18T04:03:07Z
Full Content:
The Nirvana protocol has one mission: to produce a truly resilient store of value. One that holds its worth regardless of market cycles, evolves without central planning, and scales indefinitely. Without these three legs to the stool, an asset’s value will only ever be temporary. Nirvana builds on the open and algorithmic nature of decentralized finance to create an entirely new class of asset that meets the promise of this new paradigm we call “DeFi”. In a word: Nirvana’s store of value – ANA – could very well be the most “cryptonative” of all assets on offer. It takes the principles of crypto and blockchain seriously – almost fanatically – and encodes them into its DNA. It is not controversial to note that crypto (and especially DeFi) has been going through a rough, prolonged puberty. The sector has been stuck in the awkward phase of being half “decentralized” and half “traditional”, half “democratic” while half manipulated by cabals of ultra-wealthy insiders. The goal was trustless, open, algorithmic systems, but the reality has been a messy blend of old-fashioned problems with new-fashioned aspirations. Crypto caught on because it promised to create an asset that is resilient, decentralized, and scalable. Nirvana’s purpose is to bring this vision finally to reality. Let’s take these three pillars one at a time. The hope for Bitcoin is that it becomes “digital gold” – that is, a “safe haven” asset that holds its value with a rock-hard grip. So far, this remains just hope. The annualized volatility of Bitcoin has been 4-9 times greater than gold’s, and it is anyone’s guess where the roller coaster goes next. The problem is not Bitcoin’s fault. It is that Bitcoin’s technology is not of the same ilk as its market. Its ledger is famously tamper-resistant, but its market is only human, and sometimes, humans decide to rotate out liquidity. This fact will never change. Bitcoin’s price has nothing to do with blockchain technology, and the value that Bitcoin stores has much to do with the convictions of Michael Saylor and Blackrock. We should go one step further with digital assets. Nirvana’s key insight is: make the market algorithmic too. If the liquidity for the asset is deterministic, and the humans are left out of the equation, then we can guarantee value for a token with the same mathematical precision that we guarantee its supply. Yes, Bitcoin guarantees that the supply will stop at 21 million – but what if it could guarantee that its price will never go below, say, $70k? Nirvana does. Nirvana’s ANA token has a hard floor price, guaranteed at the protocol level. This price cannot be breached because the mathematical rules of the Nirvana market ensure that every ANA token in supply can be sold back to the protocol at this floor price. But why stop there? The floor price for ANA also rises. It rises automatically with demand for ANA and follows the price of ANA upward. Every time the floor ratchets up, the intrinsic value of ANA gets locked in forever. The more expensive ANA becomes, the higher the floor price becomes, and the greater amount of value gets permanently stored in each token. We can do better than “digital gold”. After all, the price of physical gold has no bottom. When we make the market and liquidity itself algorithmic, we have an entirely new kind of asset that has truly guaranteed value. The price of ANA may go up and down, but it can only go down so far as its current floor allows. One remarkable goal of crypto protocols is to be everlasting. They should continue to live long, healthy lives even if the founder disappears. After all, they are just code. But the original creator is not infallible, and protocols need to adapt after inception to survive. It is not viable to freeze the code once, and never touch it again. The truth is that all major DeFi teams make changes to their programs, big and small, all the time. The founders must operate their business as businesspeople would, and it is an open secret that a great many attempts at decentralized governance turn out to be theater in practice. There is another path. Nirvana’s governance is simple, deterministic, and mechanical – just like its market. The first and most important step in liberating governance from central authority is zero “team allocation” of governance power. With Nirvana, everyone is on equal footing on Day 1. There are no governance tokens held back in insider wallets, put on vesting schedules, or pre-sold in dark OTC markets. Remember: when a team “airdrops” its governance token, but keeps 80% of the supply in reserve for its own stewardship, this is oligarchy, not democracy. The second step is to embed the governance process in the automated, immutable code of the contract. The code itself is like a Constitution document for the protocol – it sets the rules for how governance functions and makes affects on the program. All that can happen is users participate in governance according to those indelible rules. The method for governing Nirvana is simple. Every mutable parameter of the protocol is a number, and this number can be nudged in one direction or the other every week, according to a programmatic ballot. This elegant system gives full control over the token holders to steer the protocol gradually, without the need for any central committee with admin access. Nirvana gives control of the protocol to the rational, economic incentives of its participants. And by doing so, ensures that the protocol will endure, evolve, and adapt regardless of any one human’s involvement. DeFi broke down barriers. All you need is a connection to the internet in order to participate. But most, if not all, crypto assets buckle under the weight of massive adoption and ultimately break. They cannot truly scale as useful stores of value for hundreds of millions of individuals simply because too much of the supply is overly concentrated among those who got in early. Concentration can be good for price, but it is bad for liquidity. The key to making an asset scalable is that it becomes more liquid as it becomes more valuable. The status quo among crypto assets is unfortunately the opposite. The common playbook for tokens is to restrain supply, and thereby reduce liquidity and increase volatility, in the hope of price appreciation. Needless to say, low liquidity cuts both ways. And the brief history of crypto markets has already experienced numerous liquidity crises where panic selling seemed like the only option. The ANA token is paradigmatically different. It scales indefinitely, meaning there is no cap on supply, but it is also never printed out of thin air. Every ANA token exists strictly because someone paid for it. And when that someone bought it, they also increased its liquidity – that is, they extended the sell depth. With this one move, Nirvana turns the presumed negative relation between supply and price on its head. The prevailing myth is that a greater supply implies a lower value, but with ANA its supply and its value are positively correlated. More ANA means more liquidity and value for ANA. There is no cap on the supply for ANA because there is no cap on the value of ANA. These two properties are combined in the mathematics of the Nirvana market. ANA will become as plentiful and valuable as its holders want, and the floor price will rise at pace. But even if the circulating supply and price explode, illiquidity is not a problem ANA will ever face since the floor price is guaranteed for all tokens. Panic selling is not rational in this system. And even if a spurt of irrational selling does occur, it will never move the price beneath its floor. There is no reason to rush to the exit. Nirvana’s store of value is one that can be held securely by everyone because the market liquidity is maintained by no one. It scales automatically with adoption. Crypto ignited the imagination of a generation with its dream to produce an asset that is fair, open, and, in some real sense, permanent. Nirvana embodies this ideal by infusing cryptonative principles into every aspect of the protocol, including the price and liquidity of its asset. ANA is a “pure” cryptonative store of value. The market is cryptonative, the governance is cryptonative, and the scale is unlimited. The protocol truly steers itself and the market truly makes itself because the only power that has influence over either comes from the organic, anonymous users that participate in them. The value that ANA accrues comes from genuine market demand, and the value that ANA stores is guaranteed by the protocol’s floor price. About Nirvana Founded by a distributed team of DeFi veterans with deep roots in the Solana ecosystem, Nirvana is on a mission to redefine token markets and elevate the decentralized finance landscape. With the relaunch of Nirvana V2, the team reaffirms its commitment to building secure, transparent, and equitable financial systems for all.

Title: Why Is 3M Company (MMM) Among the Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against the other conglomerate stocks. As per Lloyd Capital, the new year starts on the back of economic resilience. Global conditions remain benign, courtesy of a healthy US economy, moderating inflation, and a gradual easing of global monetary policy. However, investors are required to remain cognizant of the several risks looming. Notably, governments worldwide have fueled economic activity in a way that has deteriorated fiscal positions. Also, inflation is yet to fully return to the respective targeted levels and the geopolitical situation remains uncertain. As per the investment management firm, investors are required to remain focused on analyzing the quality of the businesses they purchase and ensuring that these are done at prices offering an adequate margin of safety relative to intrinsic value. As per BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, the S&P 500 index should reach 6,666 by 2025 end. Part of this growth is expected to stem from healthy economic growth. The investment firm's economics team expects that the US economy should grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 2% growth. As a result, the firm has favored companies that are GDP-sensitive and is now going overweight on Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Real Estate, among others. Bank of America went on to add that, in 2025, there will be a broadening out of the stock market rally from the "Mag 7" tech stocks to other 493 stocks of the S&P 500 Index. J.P. Morgan also has somewhat similar expectations. Let’s look at that in detail. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. J.P. Morgan believes that equity earnings should broaden moving forward. Equity returns were dominated by "Mag 7" since the beginning of 2023. Over that period, the broader market (S&P 500 index) managed to return 62%, more than half of which was made by Magnificent 7 (delivering 242% over the same period). The strong returns have a solid backing as the Mag 7 were able to grow their earnings at 40%, and the remaining 493 stocks in the index were able to post 2%. However, J.P. Morgan expects that performance is expected to broaden in 2025 as the remaining "493 stocks" should be able to more than 5 times their earnings growth to 13% in 2025. Therefore, Wall Street analysts believe that investing in companies having a diversified presence should deliver healthy returns in contrast to pure-play (sector-specific) investments. The wealth management firm believes that reduced interest rates, renormalization of inventories and production, and easier comparables are expected to act as potential tailwinds for the cohort over the next year. Analysts are bullish on businesses with multiple revenue streams and one group that gives investors a diversification advantage is conglomerates. With this in mind, let us now have a look at the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener and online rankings. After getting an initial list of 20-25 stocks, we selected the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A specialized industrial laboratory, filled with high-tech machinery for producing abrasives. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) offers diversified technology services in the US and internationally. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)’s delivered a YTD return of more than ~40%, courtesy of the appointment of a new CEO and implementation of strategic initiatives. The new leadership plans to focus on 3 main areas: driving sustained organic growth, improving operational performance, and effective capital deployment. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) targets to revitalize its R&D efforts to align organic growth with global GDP growth rates. By doing this, the company should regain its innovation edge and capture new market opportunities. The new CEO’s emphasis on operational execution improvements throughout various areas including facility rationalization and distribution network optimization should unlock significant cost savings and efficiency gains. These initiatives are expected to fuel margin expansion and improve cash flow generation. Wall Street expects 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) to achieve adjusted operating margins in the mid-20s range. This expansion is expected to stem from self-help measures, such as cost structure optimization, salesforce restructuring, and facility rationalization. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)’s strong emphasis on distribution network optimization should result in improved supply chain efficiency and reduced costs, supporting margin expansion. As per Wall Street, with the appointment of a new CEO and the implementation of strategic initiatives, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) should see a potential turnaround. Analysts at UBS Group raised shares of the company from a “Neutral” rating to a “Buy” rating, increasing the target price from $130.00 to $184.00 on 13th November. Overall MMM ranks 1st on our list of the best conglomerate stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MMM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Wall Street believes that Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s long-term growth should be driven by a commercial agreement with Bombardier, which is a leading manufacturer of business jets. This alliance includes using Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s avionics and engines in Bombardier's aircraft fleet, which should act as a significant opportunity. The agreement should generate ~$17 billion in lifetime revenue opportunities for Honeywell, further strengthening the potential long-term benefits of this alliance. These revenue opportunities indicate a promising growth trajectory for Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s aerospace segment. Apart from securing a steady revenue stream, it strengthens Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s position as a leading supplier of avionics and engine technologies for business jets. The agreement should lead to higher market share and enhanced brand recognition in the business aviation segment. With Bombardier continuing to innovate and expand its product line, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) should benefit from the elevated demand for advanced avionics and propulsion systems. With the business jet market recovering and growing, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) remains well-placed to capitalize on this trend, potentially resulting in sustained revenue growth and margin expansion in the aerospace segment. UBS Group reissued a “Buy” rating with a price target of $298.00 (up from $215.00) on the company’s shares on 13th November 2024. Overall HON ranks 2nd on our list of the best conglomerate stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Bitwise Strategist Juan Leon Calls Ethereum ($ETH) ‘The Comeback Kid of 2025’

Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise Asset Management, believes Ethereum is primed for a significant resurgence in 2025. In a blog post published Dec. 17, Leon argues that Ethereum, despite being overshadowed in 2024, stands to gain tremendously from the $100 trillion market for real-world assets. Leon says that while Bitcoin and Solana dominated headlines this year, Ethereum remained largely overlooked. He points out that Bitcoin surged on the back of spot Bitcoin ETFs and historic capital inflows, posting a 130% year-to-date return, while Solana, buoyed by retail-driven meme coin speculation, delivered a 106% gain. In comparison, he says, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return seemed lackluster. However, Leon points to a pivotal shift occurring in recent weeks. According to Leon, over the past 10 days, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted $2 billion in net inflows, a stark contrast to the $250 million recorded over the preceding four months. Leon attributes this to renewed investor confidence in Ethereum. Leon credits Ethereum’s role as the dominant platform for tokenizing real-world assets as a driving factor behind its comeback. He believes that tokenization—the process of digitizing traditional financial assets like Treasury bills and real estate—represents a massive opportunity. By enabling faster, cheaper and more efficient transactions on blockchain networks, Leon suggests tokenization could transform global financial markets. Leon emphasizes that this is not a distant concept but an active trend gaining momentum today. Major financial institutions such as BlackRock and UBS are already bringing tokenized real-world assets on-chain, spanning government securities, commodities, real estate and private equity. For instance, BlackRock operates a $578 million tokenized Treasury fund, and Leon predicts tokenized fund assets will triple in 2025, with Ethereum at the center of this expansion. Leon explains Ethereum’s dominance in this space by citing its unmatched security, decentralization and track record. He argues that since launching in 2015, Ethereum has established itself as the most trusted platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Leon adds that Ethereum holds 81% of the market share in tokenized assets, which makes it the platform most asset managers prefer to use. Leon describes Ethereum as a safe and reliable choice for developers and institutions due to its proven infrastructure and expansive validator network. This stability, he suggests, encourages confidence for those looking to move real-world assets onto blockchain rails. Leon underscores the enormous size of the real-world asset market, estimated at $100 trillion globally. While he notes that shifting these assets to blockchain platforms will take time, he predicts fees generated from tokenized real-world assets could eventually surpass $100 billion annually. This amount would be more than 40 times Ethereum’s current year-to-date fees of $2.4 billion. Leon adds that greater regulatory clarity—particularly with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that supports pro-crypto policies—could accelerate this shift. He believes favorable regulations would make Ethereum an attractive investment opportunity with substantial potential rewards. Leon identifies tokenization as one of the primary drivers of Ethereum’s resurgence. Combined with other growing trends, such as the increasing use of stablecoins and AI agents engaging in crypto transactions, Leon sees Ethereum’s central role in tokenizing real-world assets as a major opportunity for growth in 2025.

Title: Jim Cramer on NIKE, Inc. (NKE): ‘It’s Amazing How Much Damage The Previous CEO Did To This Once Unassailable Brand’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan for This Week: 8 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, provided insights on Friday about this week's Federal Reserve meeting, key earnings reports, and the retail sales numbers due to be released. According to Cramer, the market is in a holding pattern at the moment, with investors growing increasingly uneasy. "When the market bides its time, guess what, people tend to get a little nervous," he remarked. “I think the Wall Street's gotten a little too negative frankly, as we get oversold and we're getting there. But I've been warning about stocks going to excessive levels for two weeks now, so I can't be all that positive until we see a couple days where bond yields actually go lower with the stock market.” Cramer pointed out that retail sales figures will be released on Tuesday, and although they are coming out just before the Fed's meeting, they will likely stir significant debate. This is especially true given the unusual timing of Black Friday this year, with a compressed shopping period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. He speculated that the bond market had a rough week, and if retail sales come in cooler than expected, it could provide a much-needed counterbalance, perhaps offering a potential buying opportunity after the Fed meeting. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 6 Airline Stocks and Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024 Looking ahead to Wednesday, Cramer noted that the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While he cautioned that nothing is certain, he emphasized that numerous Fed officials have indicated that a rate reduction is likely. He added: “Every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out. You also have people who just can't let it go, dogs with bones. As soon as we get the Fed rate cut, well, guess what? They're immediately focused on the next cut. I think this is absurd.” Cramer clarified that while he does see the Fed as important, he believes investors should not get bogged down by every minor shift in central bank policy. He reminded viewers that the Fed operates based on data, not ideology. He acknowledged that there could be dissent within the Federal Open Market Committee, but he cautioned against making investment decisions solely based on what the Fed might do next. “Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy and I wish everyone knew that. They don't.” Moving on to Friday, Cramer highlighted that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data would be released, offering the first look at the latest inflation numbers. “Finally, on Friday, we get our first look at the next set of inflation data, that's called the personal consumption expenditures number. Remember, my view is that we'll continue to get endless chatter about what the Fed might do or not. So if this number runs hot, you're gonna hear a lot of doomsaying, and why do I put it up there then? Well, because maybe it's a good opportunity to buy something on weakness because other people will be freaked out by what the doomsayers say.” In summary, Cramer believes we’re entering a seasonally strong period for stocks, though recent performance in some sectors has been underwhelming. He noted that while the Santa Claus rally typically provides a boost toward the end of the year, it’s important to wait for the Fed’s meeting to pass before making any significant moves. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 13. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Cramer stated that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has to introduce more innovation to stay competitive with its rivals. “After the close, we believe we're gonna get a revelatory report from Nike. Now, the new CEO Elliott Hill, he's an old Nike hand by the way, will have to lay out a story about how to reignite this brand globally, which is undersold from Adidas, Hoka, Deckers, Hoka of Deckers, and then On Holdings, which we've had on a bunch of times. I think Nike has to do more than just say it'll work harder with its partners. That's a hackneyed statement, doesn't hold any water with me anymore. The company needs to show innovation, dazzling innovation, the kind that makes us feel like fools for even thinking of abandoning Nike. It's amazing how much damage the previous CEO did to this once unassailable brand. It won't be undone easily and we'll need both, a roadmap with a line of sight to the end of the number cuts and a sense of newness.” NIKE (NYSE:NKE) designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services, including performance gear for various sports activities. It has been facing challenges in managing the right balance between direct-to-consumer sales and its broader sales strategy. Company executives admitted that they overemphasized direct and online sales, which left the brand unprepared for the return of in-store shopping as pandemic lockdowns eased. As the company reduced sales through large retail partners and redirected inventory to its own channels, it experienced a significant drop in revenue. In fiscal Q1 of 2025, revenue fell by 10% year-over-year, with sales coming in below expectations. In October, Matthew Friend, chief financial officer, acknowledged that the company had made mistakes by focusing too heavily on direct sales and said teams were engaging closely with partners to address these issues. Additionally, in October, NIKE (NYSE:NKE) replaced its CEO with Elliott Hill, a long-time company veteran. Hill previously ran Nike's product and marketplace division. The upcoming fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call ought to provide further insights into the new strategic direction under Hill’s leadership. Overall NKE ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NKE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wealth strategies that used to be reserved for billionaires are becoming more accessible
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-strategies-for-billionaires-are-becoming-more-accessible-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-17T19:17:32Z

Investing like a billionaire comes with a high price tag. But thanks to technology, the barriers to these elite opportunities are starting to crumble. Consider direct indexing, a strategy favored by the rich to lower taxes by selling underperforming stocks and using the losses to offset other gains. These personalized portfolios used to be out of reach of the merely affluent, requiring steep account minimums. Over the past five years, direct indexing has exploded as technological advancements have made it worthwhile for wealth managers to offer the services to Main Street customers. The account minimum for Fidelity's FidFolios, for example, is only $5,000. "Direct indexing has become accessible at a different level of wealth than it has been in the past," said Ranjit Kapila, the copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric. "That wouldn't have been available or possible without the technology trends we've had to be able to do this level of computation at scale in a cost-efficient manner." Parametric, the pioneer of direct indexing, is also moving downstream. By adopting fractional-share investing, Parametric lowered the minimum for its core product to $100,000 from $250,000. The firm plans to offer a direct-indexing product with fewer customization features for $25,000 in 2025. Private markets face steeper hurdles. This opaque field was traditionally reserved for deep-pocketed investors like pension funds and ultrarich individuals. But now investors have more access to financial results for funds and privately held companies as data providers race to meet their needs. Machine learning and AI have made it easier for these firms to extract and analyze data. BlackRock views this data as the great equalizer and has grand ambitions of indexing these opaque private markets. The asset-management giant agreed this summer to acquire the data powerhouse Preqin for $3.2 billion. "We anticipate indexes and data will be important to future drivers of the democratization of all alternatives," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on a conference call. "And this acquisition is the unlock." Leon Sinclair, Preqin's executive vice president, argued that with the number of public companies dwindling, it's imperative for mass-affluent investors to get better access to private markets. "Clearly there's more, deeper, better sources of funding for private companies that could stay private for longer," Sinclair said. "I think it's fair that the mass affluent can — in the right way — be brought along on that journey to get exposure to that part of the mosaic earlier." Kapila described these technological developments as part of a trend in wealth management to capture customers before they make it big. "There's a desire by financial advisors to try and engage investors earlier in their wealth-accumulation cycle," Kapila said. Parametric, acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2021, operates in a competitive arena. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized rivals such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said the need to compete on scale and fees required Parametric's technology to be as efficient as possible. "It'll be harder," he said. "We have to do many, many more accounts to really drive growth in assets, etc. But those challenges are exciting to me as a technologist." To meet that need, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs equity and fixed-income portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also piloting generative-AI tools to onboard accounts more efficiently. Clients' expectations are also rising. There's demand for Parametric's tax benefits but with actively managed strategies rather than indexes, he said, spurring partnerships with asset managers. Parametric recently launched an offering that allows customers to pick equities off strategies from the financial-advisory and asset-management firm Lazard. To stay ahead of the curve, Preqin is developing more sophisticated products. Last year, the UK firm launched an Actionability Signal that uses machine learning to identify private companies likely to be open for investment. "The sole focus on public information for certain tasks around valuation and risk management are not really going to be the way that people do this," Sinclair said. "We're moving much more to a world where real proprietary private information at the asset level, which is transactionally oriented, is available to people." In June, his division launched a data tool that analyzes $4.8 trillion worth of deals across 6,500 funds. This database can be used in a slew of ways, from backing up valuations in negotiations to identifying which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt paydown, contributed the most value to a successful deal. With the rise of generative AI, Sinclair expects that users will be able to interpret data with more ease using natural language commands. "I think you'll see that be more prominent across the industry where people expect to interact with large data sets in really natural common ways," he said. "We think all that will probably start to be visible over the coming years." On average, retail investors allocate just 5% of their portfolios to alternative investments. If BlackRock successfully indexes private markets, it could go a long way toward boosting that percentage. However, Sinclair said more work is required to help mass affluent investors feel comfortable investing in private markets. As someone who grew up working class and was only introduced to finance in college, he knows there is an education gap to overcome. "To get Joe Bloggs very excited and comfortable with committing capital, they need to be able to understand what the different basis of those returns are," Sinclair said. He added: "I think it's in the industry's interest to enable those new sources of capital, to bridge the gap in understanding, to bridge the gap in analytics, to bridge the gap in frequency of reporting, to make that an easier journey for people to go on."

Title: Bitwise predicts Ethereum revival in 2025 driven by institutional interest, RWA growth

Bitwise investment strategist estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a resurgence in 2025 as it rides a wave of emerging trends to capitalize on a $100 trillion opportunity in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), according to a letter shared with investors by Bitwise’s senior investment strategist, Juan Leon. The document highlighted that the crypto market was marked by two narratives this year: Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high, driven by spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in the US, and Solana’s (SOL) meteoric popularity as retail investors piled into memecoin speculation. As a result, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return paled when compared to BTC’s 130% gain and SOL’s 106% rally. However, recent signs suggest a reversal of sentiment. Over the past 10 days, Ethereum ETFs have attracted a staggering $2 billion in net inflows, eight times the $250 million net inflows recorded in the preceding four months. On Dec. 5, data from Farside Investors pointed out that the spot Ethereum ETFs traded in the US registered $428.5 million in inflows, a new daily record propelled by $292.7 million directed at BlackRock’s ETHA. Moreover, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only 3 out of the 10 past trading days saw inflows. This surge indicates that institutional and retail investors are warming up to Ethereum again. The tokenization of real-world assets might be the fuel for Ethereum’s resurgence. This process involves digitizing traditional assets — such as Treasury bills, real estate, and commodities — into blockchain-based tokens, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient trading and settlement. Tokenization is no longer a far-off dream. Major players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and UBS have adopted blockchain technology to tokenize RWAs. BlackRock’s tokenized treasury fund, BUIDL, currently has a market cap of $544 million. According to the letter, real-world assets are valued at roughly $100 trillion globally, creating a staggering opportunity. While it could take decades for significant portions of this market to shift to blockchain rails, Leon sees immense potential upside. Considering that Ethereum holds 81% of the RWA market, Leon estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually, more than 40 times the network’s $2.4 billion in fees year-to-date. The letter attributes Ethereum’s dominance to its status as the most reliable and decentralized smart contract platform, secured by its long history of supporting decentralized applications and its vast distributed validator network. As the world’s largest asset managers explore tokenized assets, Ethereum remains the “battle-tested” standard. Furthermore, regulatory tailwinds could accelerate this transformation, setting Ethereum for potentially explosive growth. The letter noted that an increasingly pro-crypto U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may provide much-needed clarity, removing barriers to adoption and institutional participation.

Title: Agreement reached on redundancy terms for staff at BD Drogheda plant
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/2024/12/17/agreement-reached-on-redundancy-terms-for-staff-at-bd-drogheda-plant/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T18:11:33Z
Full Content:
Management and staff representatives at the Becton Dickenson (BD) plant in Drogheda have reached agreement on redundancy terms more than five months after it was announced the facility is to close. The final deal is understood to provide for staff to receive six weeks of pay per year of service capped at two years’ pay in addition to their statutory entitlements. There are also to be service recognition payments of €3,000 per year for those working for the company for more than 17⅓ years as well as payments to cover the loss of benefits like health insurance and orderly wind down payments linked to productivity. Almost 200 people currently work at the plant which opened in 1964. The decision to close it was taken by the company after an international supply chain review. About 110 people will leave in March of next year with the rest staying on until the scheduled closure in September 2026. Plant manager Catherina McGuirk said the decision to close had been “extremely difficult” but that “the agreement recognises the commitment and hard work that every employee has given to BD over the years and gives our employees the clarity they need to plan for the future as we all move forward.” She said that with agreement now in place, the company would seek to take steps to ensure it leaves a last positive legacy in Drogheda. Mike Fairbourn, BD’s general manager across the UK and Ireland said the company would work with government agencies and others to seek a new owner for the plant. “I am very aware of the impact this has had on our employees and the local community,” he said. “This is why BD has committed to work collaboratively with the IDA and local officials to secure a new owner for the facility. This would mean that the site can remain as a contributor to Drogheda’s economic growth, as well as a potential source of employment. Siptu sector organiser, Andrea Cleere, welcomed the agreement with the company which was reached after talks between management, unions and other staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission. “The acceptance by our members of these redundancy terms has brought clarity concerning the conclusion of their employment with Becton Dickinson and will now allow them to plan for their future,” she said. She said some of those scheduled to leave in March had already secured new employment to commence in the period afterwards. The medical devices multinational continues to operate other facilities at Enniscorthy, Limerick and Blackrock in Dublin.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch: Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other top AI stocks to watch. Former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever recently claimed that a major change is on the horizon of artificial intelligence. Accepting a "Test Of Time" award for his 2014 paper with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le on Friday, December 13, he claimed that reasoning capabilities will make the technology far less predictable. He discussed how an idea his team had explored a decade ago regarding scaling data to new heights for pre-training AI systems, has begun to reach its limits. As such, more data and computing power had resulted in ChatGPT which OpenAI launched in 2022. "But pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end. While compute is growing, the data is not growing, because we have but one internet”. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm Speaking of its limits, Sutskever also proposed some ways of breaking new ground, such as technology itself generating new data, or AI models evaluating multiple answers before choosing the best response for a user, to improve accuracy. He further went on to predict a future of super-intelligent, self-aware AI capable of reasoning like humans, forecasting that the long-awaited AI agents will eventually become a reality in this advanced era. As such, AI leaders are now hinting that the generative AI revolution is entering a new phase, with advanced foundation models poised to bring reasoning and long-term thinking to AI capabilities. “We’re in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we’re at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking.” Long thinking enables AI models to take more time to “think over” the results they generate for us, and are an effort to bring AI into System 2. System 2, a term popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, represents a mode of thinking that is slow, deliberate, analytical, and demanding conscious effort. As these capabilities develop further, AI is expected to move beyond its current applications in different sectors to intensely impact fields like medicine, research, and education, as evidenced by OpenAI’s recent advancements and their practical benefits in accelerating scientific discovery. “We’re going to have AI systems that can talk more fluently with us, that can also visualize the real world. And this combination of reasoning and multimodal capabilities, I think, is going to enable us to build more powerful agentic applications next year.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based CRM company that has gained significant traction after the launch of its AI-powered platform called Agentforce. On December 12, Macquarie analyst Steve Koenig initiated coverage of Salesforce with a “Neutral” rating and a $370 price target. The analyst told investors in a research note that Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff is aiming to position the company as a “digital labor” pioneer with the new Agentforce product. The move strives to target growth as share gains stall and the company faces slowing momentum. Even though there is excitement and interest around Agentforce, there may be some challenges, the analyst noted. In particular, the consumption-based pricing model of Gen AI functionality could disrupt Salesforce's current seat-based revenue model. In addition, Salesforce’s sequential revenue additions have been declining for three years, a key concern for the firm. As such, meeting market expectations requires a turnaround. Overall, CRM ranks 3rd on our list of top 10 AI Stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

iStockphoto The recent series of UFO and drone sightings across the United States, especially in the Northeast, has law enforcement and American citizens on high alert. That includes the New York Police Department (NYPD), which recently experienced their own strange story involving a large, mysterious drone. According to a New York Post report and a video shared on social media, the New York Police Department came into possession of this large, mysterious drone after an email tip. The drone, which appears to measure approximately six-feet in diameter, was reportedly discovered by the NYPD on the sidewalk at Fifth Street between Market Street and Morris Avenue in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. As officers were investigating, a passer-by said he worked in the building that houses the headquarters of the drone’s manufacturer — which he identified as Amogy Inc., a sustainable energy startup working to use ammonia as a renewable fuel source, including for aerial vehicles. Amogy CEO Seonghoon Woo would later tell police, according to New York Post sources, that the drone was owned by his company. He also reportedly claimed that the drone was inoperable and had been placed on the sidewalk after a company party about a month ago. An Amogy spokesperson told the New York Post that the drone was used in a demonstration of its clean energy technology three years ago. The spokesperson also added, “NYPD took possession of it for a brief period. Amogy cooperated fully with NYPD and the drone has since been returned to the company after NYPD determined the drone was not a threat.” According to the X (Twitter) account, @ShadowofEzra, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – is one of Amogy’s investors. Other investors in the research and product development company include Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, AP Ventures, SK Innovation, and Aramco Ventures.

You can’t make this stuff up.” “I wouldn’t be surprised if these are Chinese spy craft like the spy balloon a couple years ago which the Biden administration at first denied even existing, then said it posed no threat and finally admitted what it was before a symbolic destruction of it after it had fully completed its mission of collecting and electronically sending photos and data back to Beijing,” another person commented. “‘Hey, let’s just throw a commercial drone in the street to make people believe that they aren’t the government’s drones they’re seeing. We’ll let someone find it and then have the police take pictures with it thinking they’ve cracked the mystery,'” someone else wrote on X sarcastically. “Not one single person believes this was left on a sidewalk a month ago. NOT ONE!” read another comment.

Title: Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock

The Indiana Public Retirement System has identified State Street, Northern Trust and UBS Asset Management as potential replacements for BlackRock as manager of a $969 million global fixed-income portfolio, INPRS staff said during a December 13 board meeting. Indiana law, passed in May, requires state pension funds to replace a manager or service provider if the firm is determined to have made “ESG commitments,” defined as actions taken or factors considered “with the nonfinancial purpose” related to environmental, social or governance issues. If a manager or service provider is determined to have made an ESG commitment, then the board of INPRS must replace them with a comparable firm if one is available. If there is at least one service provider expected to be materially equivalent or materially better financially for the system, then the comparable firm must be chosen. On June 21, Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott determined that BlackRock Inc. was engaged in an ESG commitment, citing BlackRock’s Form 10-K filing that referenced ESG risks and the firm’s status as a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative, a group of 325 managers representing $57.5 trillion in assets that support investing aligned to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  Following the treasurer’s finding, INPRS issued on June 28 a request for proposals for potential replacements. The BlackRock portfolio eligible for replacement is a passive global inflation-linked bond portfolio. “It’s a portfolio that, frankly, in my opinion, is not even ESG-related, because it’s a global fixed-income portfolio,” said one INPRS staff member in the December 13 meeting. INPRS staff and the fund’s investment consultant, Verus, determined State Street, UBS and Northern Trust to be comparable to BlackRock, following the RFP process. “They all have over $1 trillion in assets, [and] they all have passive fixed-income assets greater than $90 billion,” an INPRS staff member said in the meeting. Like BlackRock, State Street, Northern Trust and UBS are all members of the Net Zero Asset Owner Initiative. Firms like State Street have also been placed on watchlists and have been scrutinized for ESG commitments. The board of INPRS made a unanimous decision to confirm those three firms as comparable vendors. A provider selection is due within 180 days of the RFP, which puts the deadline as December 25. INPRS staff at the board meeting noted that there were no concerns with BlackRock’s investment performance, but BlackRock’s status as engaged in an ESG commitment dictated the change. “We’re proud of having helped hundreds of thousands of Indianans invest and retire with dignity. Despite this decision, we remain committed to Indiana and the $102 billion we have invested in the state on behalf of our clients,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said in a statement. INPRS manages $46 billion in assets for more than 529,000 beneficiaries.

Title: Google joins $90M investment into Cassava to bolster Africa's digital infrastructure | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us With cloud spend continuing to surge, tech companies are scrambling to meet demand for the necessary infrastructure, with the growing need for AI compute only adding fuel to the fire. By way of example, Microsoft and BlackRock have created a $30 billion fund to support new data centers and energy infrastructure for the burgeoning AI boom, and Meta is planning a new $10 billion subsea cable that will span the entire globe. Google, for its part, recently announced Umoja, the first subsea fiber-optic cable to connect Africa and Australia — and it’s joining a $90 million funding round into Cassava Technologies, one of the partner companies involved in the Umoja project. With its first African data center operational for a year, among other infrastructure projects such as the Equiano subsea cable, Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s now taking a direct equity stake in Cassava, though it didn’t provide comment on the rationale behind the investment. However, it’s clear that it’s looking to improve infrastructure across the continent. Indeed, Africa has been hit by widespread outages throughout 2024, which have been attributed to faulty undersea cables, so it makes sense that Google would want to fund efforts to bolster connectivity for consumers and businesses that might want to use its services. Cassava announced $310 million in funding overall, though $220 million of that is in the form of a credit facility for one of its subsidiaries. The $90 million equity tranche included investments from the U.S. federal government’s International Development Finance Corporation (DFC); Finnish development finance company Finnfund; and Google itself. The funding will help Cassava: “… strengthen its balance sheet, drive sustainable profitable growth, and cement its position as a global technology company of African heritage,” according to a press release that also detailed a broader reorganization of the company. “It’s a pivotal milestone that we expect to unlock immense value and catalyze the further expansion of our digital infrastructure and services to bridge the digital divide on the continent,” Cassava CEO and President Hardy Pemhiwa (pictured above) said. African telecommunication company Econet spun out Cassava in 2021, serving as a standalone business for Econet’s various digital services and infrastructure initiatives spanning data centers, fiber broadband networks, renewable energy, cloud, cybersecurity, and more. Although Africa is a major focal point for Cassava, it also operates across other “key growth markets” including the Middle East, India, and Latin America. Among its business units is Liquid Intelligent Technologies, which worked with Google to build the terrestrial segment of Umoja; the cable starts in Kenya, and snakes through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, before concluding its land journey in South Africa. Separately, another of Cassava’s business units, Liquid C2, this year announced a partnership with Google and Anthropic to bring “advanced cloud, cybersecurity solutions, and generative AI” services to companies across Africa. This constituted part of Google’s previous commitment to invest $1 billion in Africa’s digital economy. “Businesses are increasingly turning to generative AI to drive operational efficiencies, improve the customer experience, and empower their employees like never before,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said of its partnership with Liquid C2 at the time. “This partnership has the opportunity to transform how African businesses serve and engage their customers as we provide them a foundation for innovation.” Topics Senior Reporter Google releases its own ‘reasoning’ AI model Oura closes $200M round, bringing its valuation to $5.2B Google’s Gemini is forcing contractors to rate AI responses outside their expertise New Anthropic study shows AI really doesn’t want to be forced to change its views Perplexity acquires Carbon to connect AI search to your work files GitHub launches a free version of its Copilot SpaceX gets green light for 7th Starship mission Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.
