Title: Althera42: The New Fund Bringing the Music Royalties Model to Tech Investments

If you can invest in music royalties, why can't you also invest in "technology royalties?" That's what Althera42 wants to make possible, betting on revenue growth and scalability of technology startups without having to buy in at high valuations. Founded by Caspar Macqueen, a former BlackRock executive, and Christian Czernich, founder of the private credit firm Round2 Capital, the new fund plans to provide working capital to technology companies in Europe without taking an equity stake. Althera42 will focus on investing in intellectual property that transforms society through agentic AI, data infrastructure, defense and security, robotics and automation, software-enabled services and health and well-being. Don't Miss: "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," Business Insider reported from a company factsheet released in September. According to its website, Althera42 looks to invest in founder-led and late-stage private companies that have software and proprietary technology at their core. Althera42 will build customized deals to receive a fixed percentage of the technology companies' future revenue over several years. Through the royalties model, Althera42 can combine the upside of venture capital with the consistent cash flow of private debt, Czernich told Business Insider. Fund gains will go out to investors quarterly. The fund will charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Althera42 is targeting companies with annual revenue between roughly $17 million and $117 million (€10 million and €100 million) from recurring or licensing models. Trending: Kevin O'Leary Loves ‘Wonderful Recurring Cash Flows' — These Small Industrial Assets Deliver Just That Royalty investing is the new capital paradigm in an intellectual property-based global economy, according to the company's website. In its stated mission, Althera42 wants to establish technology royalties as a new asset class. It hopes to copy the successful playbook used for tapping into the predictable revenue streams of music and pharmaceuticals. Althera42's website boasts being architects of a new capital model, "transforming recurring revenue into investable royalty streams." Czernich told Business Insider, "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class." See Also: Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund Just Backed This Farmland Manager — Accredited Investors Can Join the Same Fund Althera42 believes royalty investing aligns its success with that of the company it funds. However, the firm does so by empowering companies to "retain control, by accelerating their impact with capital support that does not compromise their vision or leadership." According to Pitcher Partners, a national association of independent accounting firms in Australia, royalty investing is found across several industries: music, energy, mining, pharmaceuticals and software. Major private equity firms Blackstone and KKR entered the music industry in 2021 and 2022, deploying $500 million to $1 billion, and the energy royalties sector in North America is estimated to be worth between $500 billion and $1 trillion, according to Pitcher Partners' website. Macqueen, formerly BlackRock's head of U.K., Middle East and Africa for the alternatives business Aladdin, told Business Insider the firm plans to pull in $300 million with its first fund and complete 15 to 20 deals. Most deals would likely be in Europe and the U.K., potentially with some North American investments. Althera42 has offices in London and New York.

Title: Is JioBlackRock Flexi Cap worth a bite?

The scheme comes after a set of passive launches earlier in the year. With this fund, the asset manager enters the well-established flexi-cap category which already has 40+ options and manages nearly ₹5 lakh crore in assets. JioBlackRock fund’s distinct proposition is that it will be managed using a rules-based, technology-led approach rather than a purely discretionary style. At the core of the design is BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) framework. It combines human expertise with data-driven models and draws from a wide universe of about 750 Indian stocks, narrowed down from more than 1,000 using liquidity, turnover, and execution feasibility filters. Each stock is scored on the basis of signals (over 400 of them specific to India) covering fundamentals, market behaviour, and alternative data. The models appear to be refreshed weekly. A benchmark-aware risk process is meant to keep deviations controlled vis-a-vis Nifty 500 Total Return Index whose current top holdings include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, L&T, ITC, TCS and SBI. The fund’s aim will be to deliver consistent long-term alpha while managing volatility. For perspective, flexi-cap funds as a category have a three-year monthly standard deviation of 3.7 per cent and a Sortino ratio of 0.25, according to ACEMF. The technology backbone is BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, which is widely used by global institutions for portfolio risk analytics, transaction cost modelling, and compliance. In principle, this could provide the fund managers with an advantage in managing costs and risks at scale. Another selling point is that a systematic approach can reduce behavioural biases that affect human decision-making, such as overconfidence or recency. On the investor-facing side, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund has several interesting features. It has no exit load, unlike many equity funds that impose a fee for exits within a year (0.10-1 per cent). The indicative total expense ratio for the direct plan is 0.5 per cent, placing it in the 1st quartile (lowest cost group) basis direct plan offerings. Fund managers Tanvi Kacheria and Sahil Chaudhary bring experience in quantitative and index portfolio management. India’s equity market has expanded significantly in recent years, with higher trading volumes, broader sector representation, and more IPOs adding to the listed universe. A larger opportunity set makes systematic strategies easier to apply. That said, the gaps are clear. As an NFO, there is no live performance record. The back-tested numbers shown in the presentation are hypothetical and cannot substitute for real-world data. Investors should also be aware that regular rebalancing, while intended to capture opportunities quickly, could increase churn and costs if not managed tightly. Flexi-cap funds are designed to provide long-term growth by giving managers the freedom to invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks without restriction. They can suit investors who want equity exposure but prefer to leave the market-cap allocation decisions to professionals. The flexi-cap space already has proven schemes with long track records. On average, existing actively managed funds in the category have delivered about 16.9 per cent CAGR over three years and 20.9 per cent over five years, broadly in line with the Nifty 500 TRI’s returns of 16.9 per cent and 20.8 per cent over the same periods. Fund portfolios are typically tilted towards large-caps (57 per cent), with decent allocations to mid-caps (20 per cent) and small-caps (17 per cent). Investors will need to weigh whether an untested quant-driven offering is worth adding alongside established names. Overall, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund represents an ambitious attempt to bring systematic active investing into India’s retail mutual fund space. Its differentiators are breadth of stock coverage, use of alternative data and AI, governance filters, and lower cost. The risks are the lack of a live record and dependence on models that may behave differently in stressed conditions. Also, small bets across a large number of stocks to beat Nifty 500 may result in a very diffused portfolio. For investors seeking core flexi-cap exposure, established funds remain more reliable choices. JioBlackRock Flexi Cap may be tracked as an option for satellite allocation once it builds a live record. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings’ current preferred choices include HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, and Franklin India Flexi Cap Fund.

Title: Sea views on Dublin Bay’s south side to go if planned flood walls for Dart line are built

Plans for new flood defences along the Dart line in south Dublin will replace household sea views with concrete walls, residents have learned. They say the plan will also kill off hopes for a long-promised walking and cycling path along Dublin Bay. Irish Rail says the work is vital to protect the rail line from rising sea levels, intensifying storms and heavier rainfall, but local people are appealing for a rethink. “If this goes ahead, there will be a lot of saddened people,” Marie Baker, a Fine Gael councillor for the area said. The new defences would run for 4km from Merrion Gates to Seapoint – one of five stretches of rail line prioritised for works under the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Projects scheme (ECRIPP). [ Rising sea levels, more storm surges and shifting weather patterns put properties at riskOpens in new window ] They would be built of concrete on top of the existing stone walls, adding 1.3 metres to the height on average. Some glass would be installed at stations along the route to preserve views for waiting passengers, but Irish Rail said it was not possible to use it more extensively. “Flood glass, on its own, is unable to withstand the size of wave and storm loads we expect to experience by 2075, for which we are designing these interventions,” a spokeswoman said. Ms Baker said the loss of views was no trivial issue, as the connection with the sea defined the character of the whole area. She said she had suggested installing storm drains and attenuation tanks to quickly drain and hold flood waters, and hoped this might still be considered. “I don’t think people realise the extent of what is planned. We needed better drawings from Irish Rail to show what it looks like now and what it will look like when they do what they’re planning as a comparison. “If you’re sitting on the Dart, you’re not going to see a thing. I’m not denying we need to do something, but we need to look more at this proposal.” Retired architect Michael Collins said the proposal would end hopes of completing the Sutton to Sandycove (StoS) walking and cycling path. The northern half from Sutton to the Dublin Docklands has been completed, but the southern half has not progressed. “StoS would not only provide a tremendous amenity but it would actually solve the flooding problem,” Mr Collins said. He said a continuous promenade on the seaward side of the rail line, bounded by a wall of moderate height and bolstered by rock armour, would block the waves and allow any overtopping to spill on to the path, saving the tracks and the views. [ Areas on Dublin’s northside among most at-risk from ‘extreme coastal events’Opens in new window ] He said the additional cost could be offset by savings from an Eirgrid plan to lay a high voltage cable from Blackrock to Poolbeg, by running it out into the bay and back. “Eirgrid could lay the cable under the promenade, which would cut the length in half and save an awful lot of money,” Mr Collins said. “We have a solution that works for everyone, and it’s very frustrating when agencies don’t work together for the common good.” Irish Rail said flood defences outside the existing walls were considered, but were ruled out because of the expected impact on protected habitats. Special dispensation from Europe would be needed, and this could significantly delay the project, it said. “The works proposed in these areas would not preclude a walk or cycleway seaward of the rail boundary being delivered in future by a body responsible for active travel,” it added. However, it said these too would likely need permission from Europe. ECRIPP is open for public consultation and submissions until October 13th.

Editor Crypto Coin Desk, Krisztian Sandor With Open Issuance and AI payment standards, Stripe is doubling down on its bet on the rising role of blockchain and digital agents in payments. Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid’s USDH and MetaMask’s mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don’t build on top of someone else’s coin,” Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. “With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy,” Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on “pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream.” Read more: Why Circle and Stripe (And Many Others) Are Launching Their Own Blockchains Crypto Crypto Crypto

Dear friends, Welcome to the October issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. And welcome to the Dog Days of Autumn! The natural world is scrambling to keep up with the changes we’ve triggered, and continue to intensify, upon it. As I walked one of the many bike/hike trails in the Quad Cities on Sunday, I confronted two worlds. One was defined by 90-degree temperatures, hot sunshine, and cracked earth. The other by the rhythm of birds called southward and plants quietening for the season to come, ready for the renewal that heralds the spring. Some plants need the signal of darkness to trigger their autumnal bloom. The mums in our south garden once attended my mum’s funeral; today, they celebrate, triggered by the lengthening night. A sort of “geez, it’s getting dark around here, I better get my butt moving” response. I wonder if we might take inspiration from them? Common milkweed, the Augustana College Quad, late September 2025 Our colleague Lynn Bolin addresses portfolio construction for uncertain times with two complementary October pieces. In “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control,” he presents a ten-fund “all-weather” strategy targeting 8% returns with 12% maximum drawdown, emphasizing Alternative Global Macro, Alternative Multi-Strategy, and globally diversified funds. Drawing on Rob Dix’s The Price of Money and Kenneth Rogoff’s Our Dollar, Your Problem, Bolin argues that Quantitative Easing inflated asset prices, while current high valuations suggest below-average future U.S. stock returns, leading him toward funds like FPA Flexible Fixed Income (FPFIX), PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX), and BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX). His companion article, “Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios,” explores hedges against what Dix and Rogoff predict will be “more frequent bouts of inflation” and financial instability. While gold has soared past $3,750, Bolin seeks lower-volatility alternatives, comparing funds like AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) and Frost Credit (FCFAX) against his target portfolio. Though Lynn is not expecting 1970s-style stagflation imminently, he’s adding fifty funds to his evaluation system for potential portfolio modifications, balancing inflation protection with his conservative risk tolerance. Stay tuned! We had an unusual wealth of fund launches to report on, resulting in two Launch Alerts and one not-quite-Launch-Alert. Tweedy, Browne International Insider + Value ETF launched on September 10, 2025. It is active, quantitative, and research-driven. It works from two assumptions, which are corroborated by a lot of evidence. You should: If the folks in the know are pouring money into stocks you’ve identified as undervalued, that’s a powerful confirmation. It has worked well with its sibling, Tweedy, Browne Insider + Value ETF, which launched in 2024, falls in the mid-cap value box, and is up 23% YTD. RACWI US ETF launched on September 11, 2025, and is Research Affiliates’ permutation of an S&P 500 index fund. Here’s the tweak: RAFI starts with the question, “Should these firms even belong in the investable universe?” They answer that question by looking at corporate fundamentals (do they make money?) and then excluding companies that are failing, without regard to their stock price. Currently, they exclude about 25 of the S&P 500 companies, but then market-cap-weight the remainder just as the S&P does. The Militia Long/Short ETF is the not-quite-a-Launch-Alert. Launch Alerts target funds launched in roughly the past 6-8 weeks, while Militia launched in January 2025. We wanted to put it on your radar because Sam Lee, former Morningstar editor and strategist, founder of SVRN Asset Management, former MFO contributor, and a remarkably smart guy, wanted to put it on ours. Finally, The Shadow reports on the industry’s latest tribulations, including T. Rowe Price’s decision to liquidate its once-promising T. Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund, a bunch of funds deciding they’d rather go to the ETF dance, and Dodge & Cox triggering three sets of share splits. The conversion story took a twist in early October with the SEC’s imminent announcement of a decision to permit ETF share classes of mutual funds. That means that you might be able to choose either the Fidelity Low Priced Stock fund’s no-load retail share class or the same fund’s ETF share class. According to Morningstar, at least 75 fund firms have lined up to create ETF shares of their existing funds, which might well blunt the incentive for the fund-to-ETF conversions that have proliferated in the past year or two. Geoff Colvin, senior editor-at-large at Fortune, made two useful observations in late September: His simple statement that stocks are highly valued is indisputable. Most measures are screaming that the S&P is insanely overpriced. The Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price/Earnings ratio is the highest it has been since the dotcom peak. The price-to-sales ratio hit a new all-time high this week. The Buffett Indicator—ratio of the market’s capitalization to GDP—says stocks are highly overvalued, and Warren Buffett is holding an enormous cash cache because he can’t find bargains. But also: Greenspan gave his [Irrational Exuberance] speech in December 1996—almost four years before the market plunge. As he told Fortune years later, “If you had left the market when I gave my irrational exuberance speech, you would have missed another 80% of increase” in stock values. (Actually, it was closer to 100%.) (“Back in the ’90s a Fed chief warned about ‘irrational exuberance’ in the markets. Stocks rose 105% over the next 4 years,” Fortune, 9/30/2025) CNN notes the same anomaly: “Hiring is at a standstill. Inflation is on the rise again. Consumer sentiment is slipping near historic lows. Americans are increasingly fed up with the economy” (“Why are stocks setting records when the economy feels down in the dumps?” CNN, 9/15/2025). Satya Pradhuman, once the chief small cap strategist at Merrill Lynch and now director of research at Cirrus Research, claims that the market is already in crazy-land: “The melt-up of risk-taking in U.S. equities has pierced the upper boundaries of a normalized range. A combination of a very crowded equity market, combined with an extreme risk appetite, places the U.S. equity market into an overtly speculative chapter” (“Stock market’s relentless rally threatens to turn into a ‘melt-up’,” via Dow Jones, 9/13/2025). Quartz reports, “Wall Street’s penny aisle is back in business. More than 90 companies — including a Hong Kong noodle shop and a smattering of obscure startups — have floated IPOs this year at $5 a share, the highest number since the Regan years. Penny stocks’ comeback has less to do with solid fundamentals than it does with commission-free apps that turn speculation into a swipe, crypto-fueled investors chasing the next moonshot, and a regulatory spotlight that has wandered elsewhere. For retail traders shut out of $4 trillion tech titans and six-figure Bitcoin, penny stocks offer a cheap thrill: thousands of shares for less than the price of a single iPhone” (Quartz Daily Brief, 9/25/2025). On the day I write this (a) the federal government shut down, (b) the jobs report from ADP was disastrous, and (c) the stock market went up. The federal response has been “to boldly implement” Trump’s order to get alternative assets into retirement plans (Department of Labor News Release, 9/23/2025), while FINRA moved to relax the rules surrounding day-trading, so both retirement and non-retirement investors can treat their portfolios like a roulette wheel! Whee? The key to all of this is the willingness of the American consumer (aka “you”) to continue having confidence in Mr. Trump’s steady hand on the tiller, which leads you to continue buying more and more stuff, relying on more and more debt (currently a record $18.4 trillion) to do so. And the level of stock ownership is now at a record high; almost 45% of Americans’ net wealth rests in their stock portfolios (Federal Reserve data, 9/28/2025). So the American consumer is propping up the stock market, and the stock market is propping up the economy, and now consumer confidence is cratering. Will there be a devastating market crash? Yep. Soon? Maybe. Maybe not. What’s an investor to do? The same as always, dear friends. Act before the storm, not during it. Find an asset allocation (mine, as readers now, is 25/25/25/25) that will likely produce the returns you need to meet your goals with a level of volatility that allows you to continue enjoying life and sleeping regularly. Our recommendation has always been to look for managers who earn their keep and your trust: they have an enormous dislike of losing your money, they’re fully invested with you, they speak sensibly, and have a record of success across friendly and hostile markets. Do not ever sit at the same table with someone who preens and struts and talks about beating the market; they’re fools and potentially contagious. The goal is not to “beat the market,” it’s to live a good life and then move on. Jonathan Clements, who died this week of cancer at 62, was that rarest of financial journalists: someone the industry couldn’t buy, couldn’t charm, and couldn’t seduce into softening his message. For nearly two decades at The Wall Street Journal and later as founder of Humble Dollar, he wielded his pen like a scalpel, cutting away the jargon, the self-serving studies, and the expensive nonsense that Wall Street had convinced investors was gospel. Jonathan Clements and I corresponded once, around the launch of Humble Dollar. He was amiably cool from my perspective, which I expected and respected. I invited him to add his voice to Mutual Fund Observer when it called to him, but he had other plans and, as it turned out, far greater success. Clements’s prescription was elegant in its simplicity: eliminate human agency wherever possible, invest in broad market index funds, keep costs ruthlessly low, and refuse to believe that anyone, whether broker, advisor, or fund manager, could consistently beat the market. He had the data on his side, the integrity to say it plainly, and the courage to sustain a “nonstop blizzard of complaint and criticism” from an industry that hated what he wrote. MFO pursued a different path. I’ve argued for considering small, boutique managers whose strategies made sense and whose understanding of themselves as “risk managers” rather than “return managers” was deeply ingrained. I believe that thoughtful human judgment, properly applied and fairly compensated, can add value for investors willing to do their homework, most especially in turbulent markets. Jonathan would have seen this as precisely the kind of thinking he spent his career arguing against. And he wouldn’t have been entirely wrong to be skeptical. But here’s what mattered more than our tactical disagreement: we shared an absolute commitment to helping people achieve financial security in the face of forces designed to enrich an industry at the expense of those it claimed to serve. Clements and I arrived at different answers, but we were working on the same problem, and we were both trying to solve it honestly. That honesty was Clements’s defining characteristic. Jason Zweig noted that in over 1,000 columns, Jonathan “never once, to the best of my knowledge, wrote anything that was flagrantly wrong. He never misled or fibbed, or lied to his readers.” In an industry built on obfuscation, that record is astonishing. But what strikes me most, reading the tributes from those who knew him, is how Clements understood that money was never the point. Money was a tool for building relationships, for creating experiences with family and friends, for making a difference, and for achieving peace of mind. He wrote about raising financially responsible children. He mocked the industry’s obsession with accumulating possessions rather than celebrating meaningful experiences (which is not the same as “selfies”). And in his final year, he wrote with grace and humor about his own dying, making space for others to talk about what we’re all moving toward and helping them feel less alone. “To philosophize is to learn to die,” wrote Montaigne (with thanks to Jason Zweig for the reminder of Montaigne’s words). Jonathan Clements spent his career teaching people how to live, how to use money as a means rather than an end, how to see through the fog, how to protect themselves and their families from predation dressed up as advice. And then, at the end, he taught us how to face death with laughter and courage and generosity. The financial services industry will not mourn him. But millions of investors who achieved comfortable retirements because of his clear, consistent, principled guidance will remember him with gratitude. Those of us who disagreed with some of his investment philosophy can still honor the integrity with which he held and expressed it. In a field that rewards complexity, obfuscation, and self-interest, Jonathan Clements chose clarity, honesty, and service. The example matters more than the investment strategy. Rest in peace, Mr. Clements. You fought the good fight. After a small struggle to get their shareholders to endorse or reject a proposal to make AKREX the largest-ever fund-to-ETF conversion. A majority of shareholders finally voted in September to endorse the change. The upcoming benchmarks: October 10, 2025, the retail ARKEX shares merge with the institutional AKRIX ones October 24, AKRIX-the-fund becomes AKRE-the-ETF October 27, ARKE begins trading on the NYSE While Akre shareholders were considering, BlackRock moved to swiftly convert two funds into active ETFs: the BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity Fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity Fund. The new ETF names are iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF (BDYN) and iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF (BDVL). Both are managed by a Global Allocation team headed by the firm’s CIO, Rick Rieder. Both are three-star funds. Since both are part of BlackRock’s “managed portfolio” business, I suspect that the conversion was made to simplify their use for that program.

Your gifts are an immediate vote of confidence and a powerful reminder that this community is full of people who value the work we do. I’m utterly diffident about encouraging folks to contribute to the Observer when there are so many pressing needs to address: serious, adult journalism is struggling to find readers willing to pay for reliable information, food banks are being drained at an alarming rate, conservation groups are desperately trying to compensate for the insanity that’s gripped the executive branch, and so on. Here’s our recommendation: Go do good. Don’t talk about doing it. Do it. Do something.

Title: Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios

Time Published: 2025-10-03T21:50:20Z

Gold is considered one of the best hedges against inflation and uncertainty. Gold fell from about $385 in 1995 to a low of around $250 by 2001, to a high of $1,750 in 2011 before falling to $1060 in 2015. It is now over $3,750. For the past ten years, iShares Gold Trust (IAU) has had a total return of 195% compared to 289% for Vanguard 500 Index ETF (VOO). In this article, I compare funds with lower volatility than stocks and gold to protect from inflation. Preparing for inflation should be part of an overall strategy and not just timing the market when inflation rises. Most of my career was in the precious metals industry on the technical side. It was a stable industry to be in during the financial crisis, but stressful when gold tumbled. Recently, the price of gold has increased significantly due in large part to central banks buying gold, the weaker dollar, geopolitical risk, economic uncertainty, falling interest rates, and inflation. The price of gold and stocks of gold miners have risen so fast, I don’t consider either category appropriate for my conservative, low-turnover portfolio in retirement. Tariffs are making the headlines for increasing inflation. Core inflation has risen from 2.3% in April to 2.9% in August. New tariffs were just added for heavy trucks, drugs, and kitchen cabinets. Economists in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Third Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters estimate that headline CPI inflation will begin to fall from third-quarter levels, but the rules keep changing. The Federal Reserve is now lowering short-term rates to stimulate employment at the risk of aggravating inflation. Keep in mind that inflation is the change in price levels, so the increase from tariffs will be a temporary bump in inflation to a “permanently” higher price level. In addition to tariffs, the value of the dollar has fallen by eleven percent this year. As inflation increases, the purchasing power of the dollar decreases. The falling value of the dollar raises the price of imports while making U.S. exports less expensive. The falling dollar hurts investments in U.S. held by foreigners who finance part of the national debt. The cost of buying a dollar of earnings of the S&P 500 is now $30 per dollar of earnings. It is known as the price-to-earnings ratio and has doubled since 2010. I recently read The Price of Money by Rob Dix, who suggests that we may be in for a period of higher inflation and lower interest rates. I also finished reading “Our Dollar, Your Problem” by Kenneth Rogoff, in which he expects “a sustained period of global financial volatility marked by higher average real interest rates and inflation and more frequent bouts of debt and financial crises.” The reasons have a lot to do with the burden of rising national debt and how it is financed, along with the decline of the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. I am more concerned about long-term inflation as described by Rob Dix and Kenneth Rogoff; tariffs may play a role. Mr. Dix explained that Quantitative Easing was not highly effective for raising inflation to the Federal Reserve target of 2% initially because the money went into the financial system and largely resulted in inflating asset prices such as stocks. QE was more effective following the COVID recession because it increased the money available to the Treasury to create stimulus for the consumer. Along with disruptions to the supply chain from COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation rose to levels not seen since the 1970s. Figure #1 captures the annual inflation rate of the personal consumption expenditures price index and the Federal Funds rate, which is the rate at which commercial banks lend to other banks overnight. The COVID bear market occurred in 2020, inflation rose dramatically in 2021, and the Federal Funds rate was raised to slow inflation in 2022. My analysis of fund performance in this article focuses to a large extent on 2021. Figure #1: Federal Funds Rate and PCE Year-Over-Year Inflation Source: Author using St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. Wolf Richter discusses mortgage rates being between 6% to 7% following a large increase in home prices after the COVID recession in Longer-Term Treasury Yields & Mortgage Rates Jump after Rate Cut, Yield Curve Steepens, Bond Market Gets Edgy on Wolf Street: “But that’s a bubble-pricing problem now that should have never occurred, not a rate problem. The rates are fine. They’re historically at the low end of the normal range. The 5% and below mortgage rates were a creature of massive QE during the Financial Crisis and after, when the Fed loaded up on trillions of dollars of Treasury securities and MBS to push down long-term rates. But the Fed has been doing the opposite since the second half of 2022 and has shed $2.4 trillion of those securities as QT continues.” The Federal Reserve has been gradually unwinding its balance sheet when the economy and markets are strong. I expect the long end of the yield curve to stay higher for longer because of the high national debt, specter of inflation, unwinding of Quantitative Easing, and rising geopolitical risks. Federal Reserve independence is gradually being eroded. The Federal Reserve is lowering short-term rates, and a coordinated effort by the Treasury and Federal Reserve may lower intermediate-term rates. I anticipate that short- and intermediate-term rates will be lower over the next year, but remain higher than they were from 2009 to 2021. Table #1 shows Lipper Categories that have traditionally hedged against inflation, along with those I identified by looking at the recent period of high inflation. They are sorted by a Ranking System composed of my proprietary ranking system, three-month return, return in 2021 when inflation was rising, four-year Martin Ratio for risk-adjusted return, and yield. I have added toggles to my investment system to add or tilt weights for “Tax Efficiency” for after-tax accounts, “Risk Off” for my outlook, and “Yield” if income is an objective. Table #1 is rated for a conservative, tax-advantaged account where I am seeking income. Metrics in the table are shaded red for “worst” and blue for “best”. Table #1: Categories That Did Well During High Inflation – Four-Year Metrics Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, and Morningstar returns as of Sep 26th. The Commodities Precious Metals category did not provide much protection against inflation in 2021, but has performed well since then because of rising rates, falling dollar, and uncertainty. Notice the high maximum drawdowns of Precious Metals Equity, Real Estate, and the S&P500 relative to other categories. Inflation-protected bonds are considered safe protection against inflation. The green shaded categories are the ones that I identified in this month’s companion article, “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. The gold shaded categories are what I consider to be possible lower-risk hedges against inflation; however, commodities can be very volatile, as we will see later. The green shaded funds are the ones that I currently own, and the blue shaded funds are in my Conservative Target Portfolio for future investments. I like the Flexible Portfolio, Alternative Global Macro, and Alternative Multi-Strategy categories, where managers have the discretion to adjust according to market conditions. I used Mutual Fund Observer metrics and Portfolio Visualizer to select the following funds in Table #2 to be added to my watch list for inflation. As a general observation, they either have higher MFO Risk or lower MFO Rating for risk-adjusted returns compared to the funds in “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. Table #2: MFO Metrics for Selected Funds – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. In Table #3, I substituted Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) for Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) in my conservative portfolio from the companion article. This adjusted portfolio has an APR of 9.5% compared to 8.4% for the Conservative Portfolio; however, it also has a higher drawdown of -14.8% compared to -12.4% and the Ulcer Index increases from 2.2 to 2.9. The portfolio continues to have an MFO Risk of “Conservative” (MFO Risk =2). Table #3: MFO Portfolio Modified for More Inflation Protection – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Portfolio Tool. Figure #2 compares Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) to BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX), Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). The funds being tested have higher returns and higher volatility than the funds in my target portfolio. Figure #2: Comparison of Total Return for Selected Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. After doing the research for this article, I added around fifty funds to my investment system, which I have not had time to evaluate thoroughly. This is a task for next month to see if I want to modify my Conservative Target Portfolio. When looking to invest in a fund, I generally start with the five funds with the highest rating per Lipper Category from my spreadsheet. In a stagflationary environment like the 1970s, I would want to own a fund that invests in commodities such as the AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX). I don’t expect inflation to reach that extreme in the near term. I prefer the lower volatility of PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). More aggressive investors and those with major concerns over tariffs may prefer ARCNX. Frost Credit (FCFAX) and Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) are both good funds, with FCFAX having higher returns and yield with slightly more risk. I have rungs on my bond ladder maturing next year, and I will continually reevaluate the funds in my Conservative Target Portfolio.

The conversion of Akre Focus Fund into an ETF was authorized by its investors in September and is proceeding apace. Thanks to all who took the time to vote their shares! On October 17, abrdn International Small Cap fund and the $36m abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income fund will become the abrdn International Small Cap Active ETF and the abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Active ETF, respectively. The BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF. JPMorgan Unconstrained Debt Fund has been reorganized into the JPMorgan Flexible Debt ETF effective September 26th. Deepwater Beachfront Small Cap ETF is in registration. Joe Robillard will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been disclosed. The ETF will primarily invest in small-cap companies. Hood River Emerging Markets Fund is in registration. Lance R. Cannon, CFA, Rohan B. Kumar, and Ruoshi Qi will be the portfolio managers. Expenses have not been stated. Sterling Capital has registered five new ETFs. Sterling Capital Ultra Short Duration; Short Duration Bond, National Municipal Bond, Multi-Strategy Income, and Equity Premium Income ETFs. Many managers, no expense ratios. The Truth Social American Energy Security ETF, Truth Social American Icons ETF, Truth Social American Next Frontiers ETF, Truth Social American Red State REITs ETF, and Truth Social American Security & Defense ETF are in registration. Matthew Tuttle will be the portfolio manager for each of the funds. Expenses have not been stated. Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF is in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager. Expenses have not been stated. Westwood Enhanced Income Opportunity, Enhanced Multi-Asset Income, and Enhanced Alternative Income ETFs are in registration. Numerous managers; expenses have not been stated as of this filing. Dodge and Cox is forward splitting several of its mutual funds: Balanced, International, and Stock in the amounts eight for one, four for one, and sixteen for one, respectively, at the close of business on October 24. Their reason for the stock split was the following: New mutual funds generally launch with an initial NAV of $10.00 per share. Given their earlier inception dates and asset classes, the NAVs of the Balanced Fund, International Stock Fund, and Stock Fund have grown considerably. We believe the share splits will better align these Funds’ NAVs with the other Dodge & Cox Funds’ NAVs. As of September 27, 2025, the NAV for Balanced is $110.13/share, Stock is $276.70, and International is $64.85. Leuthold Grizzly Short Fund underwent a one-for-four reverse stock split at the close of business on September 22nd, which boosted its per-share NAV from about $5 to about $20. Effective on January 21, 2026, Virtus is eliminating the Class C Shares on virtually all of its funds. Given that “C” shares are and always were a marketing malignancy (“hey, look! There’s no sales load though we do …umm, charge you 1.76% annually forever”), we always celebrate their disappearance. None that we’ve found. DoubleLine Floating Rate Fund will be reorganized into the American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund once it is approved by shareholders. The reorganization will occur sometime during the first quarter of 2026. Quick history: The American Beacon FEAC Floating Rate Income Fund was previously the Sound Point Floating Rate Income Fund until it was acquired by American Beacon. First Eagle Alternative Credit, LLC’s (FEAC) investment advisory agreement ended on June 20, 2025, at which time DoubleLine Capital commenced managing the fund, and the name of the fund was changed to American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund. DoubleLine Income Fund and DoubleLine Infrastructure Income Fund will change their names to DoubleLine Securitized Credit Fund and DoubleLine Select Income Fund, with predictable rewrites to their prospectuses, on October 28th. The hottest trend in prospectus writing? “The fund may terminate and liquidate at any time without shareholder approval,” a phrase now used by the AIM, Amplify, Collaborative Investments, ETF Opportunities, Innovators, Northern Lights, REX, SCM, Truth Social, and Ultimus ETF trusts, among others. Sub-text: “We’re just tossing s**t against the wall to see what sticks, we got no commitment to any of this stuff and want to be able to flush it as quickly and easily as possible! Welcome aboard!” 2x Daily Software Platform ETF will be liquidated on October 10, 2025. The fund launched on July 1, 2025, and no one, including the managers, cared. September 25, 2025, was a big day for the AXS Real Estate Income ETF! It managed to cease operations, liquidate its assets, and prepare to distribute proceeds to shareholders of record. Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ticker: ELON) will be liquidated on October 10, 2025, because “the Fund could not conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner over the long term due to the Fund’s inability to attract sufficient investment assets to maintain a competitive operating structure.” Here’s the strategy: short Ford, long Tesla, trust Elon. If the Morningstar charting is correct, it seems to have lost 50% in its first two weeks. Apparently, the fund, which launched in mid-February 2025, somehow lost faith and only drew $1.1 million in assets. Per Morningstar, neither of the managers risked their own money on the fund. BlackRock Sustainable High Yield Bond Fund is closing to new purchases on November 12, 2025, and will be liquidated on December 12, 2025. Franklin Sustainable International Equity ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 16, 2026. One-star fund that was wildly successful from 2017-2021 and hasn’t been able to find its butt with both … well, it has trailed 95-100% of its peers over the past 1, 3, and 5 year periods. Harding, Loevner Chinese Equity and Emerging Markets ex China have begun the process of liquidating their assets, which the managers expect to complete by November 19, 2025. Same team, negligible assets. Johnson International Fund, which was launched in 2008, will be liquidated on November 21, 2025. A curious development, really. The fund has had the same manager since inception. He’s been very successful as the lead manager on the Johnson Opportunity Fund, but international has managed to pretty consistently trail 80-100% of its peers and has attracted negligible assets. Kempner Multi-Cap Deep Value fund will be liquidated on or about October 15, 2025. Penn Mutual AM Strategic Income Fund and Penn Mutual AM 1847 Income Fund will cease operations and liquidate on or about November 14, 2025. Themes Airlines ETF and Themes European Luxury ETF closed and liquidated on September 12, 2025. T Rowe Price Global Consumer Fund will be liquidated on November 14, 2025. T Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund will experience liquidation and dissolution on or about January 23, 2026. No reason given, though performance sort of sucks. It’s a Price fund whose five-year records (1.89%) barely exceed its expense ratio (1.19%). The mandate was to outperform cash with low volatility and low correlation to the stock and bond markets. The “edge” was that the managers had immediate and ongoing access to other T Rowe Price managers, which gave them exceptional insights into movements across asset classes. The system may have broken down when Price had an internal restructure, which impeded the managers’ daily strategy pipeline. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 Billion Bet on a Lesser-Known Data Center Firm

(Bloomberg) -- At the start of the year, a lesser-known infrastructure company called Aligned Data Centers managed to pull off a $12 billion fundraise — more than some of the world’s leading artificial intelligence startups have been able to secure in a single round. The goal: dramatically expanding its footprint to support surging demand for the facilities that power AI systems. Nine months later, with much of that build-out still in the works, Aligned is in advanced discussions to be acquired by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners in a $40 billion deal. It’s on pace to be one of the largest transactions of the year and potentially the biggest ever for any data center company. The takeover talks, which Bloomberg News reported late Thursday citing people familiar with the matter, are indicative of just how much money investors are willing to throw at companies viewed as integral for the AI boom. According to a Goldman Sachs report issued Thursday, AI-related companies have accounted for $141 billion in corporate credit issuance so far this year, already eclipsing the $127 billion in total debt last year. As tech companies say they’re prepared to spend hundreds of billions, if not trillions, on physical infrastructure for AI, there’s growing demand for firms like Aligned that promise to meet those needs. That’s true even if most of Aligned’s data center capacity – and the revenue expected from it – is still in the planning stages. “They have a lot of planned activity,” Ari Klein, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said about Aligned in particular. “You’re probably seeing companies paying up for that planned activity, or what could come.” Founded in 2013, nearly a decade before the generative AI boom, Aligned has long focused on providing custom data centers for businesses, with an emphasis on efficiency and sustainability. The company is backed by Macquarie Asset Management and has 78 data centers under management or in development across the Americas, according to its website. As with other data center providers, Aligned has come under new pressure to build more and bigger data centers in recent years for AI. In January, Aligned said it had raised $12 billion in equity and debt to speed up its plans to build out 5 gigawatts of data center capacity, or enough to power half of New York City on a hot day. The investment was intended to help Align “seize opportunities driven by the surging demand for AI-ready infrastructure,” said Andrew Schaap, the company’s chief executive officer, in a social media post at the time. “Aligned is ready to meet this moment.” The only challenge is that data centers — and all the infrastructure, including power supplies to support them — take time. Currently, Aligned has just over 600 megawatts of data center capacity that’s live, with another 700 megawatts of capacity under construction, according to DC Byte, a market intelligence firm that tracks the industry. Still, the combined capacity makes Aligned a “decent-sized operation,” according to DC Byte founder Edward Galvin. Coreweave Inc., a cloud provider that has struck deals with OpenAI and Nvidia Corp., has 470 megawatts of live capacity, according to public filings, with much more planned. CoreWeave reported just over $1.91 billion in revenue in 2024. And while Aligned is in talks to sell potentially for $40 billion, Coreweave has a market value of more than $65 billion. Aligned has not publicly disclosed its sales figures. If it charged about $210 per kilowatt per month, the industry standard for data center pricing according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE, Aligned’s annual revenue would be nearly $1.6 billion. That figure would rise to $3.4 billion, including the capacity under construction. Representatives for Aligned did not respond to a request for comment. By comparison, Fermi Inc., a real estate investment trust looking to draw data center tenants, saw its market value top $19 billion in its public debut this week. The company, co-founded by former US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, has no revenue – a sign of the frothy market for any business tied to the AI infrastructure boom. On its website, Aligned said its customers have included Nutanix Inc., a cloud software company, Datto, an IT provider, as well as an unnamed government agency and multinational fintech company, among others. Aligned is also developing a new data center in Texas for Lambda Inc., a cloud infrastructure company that’s backed by Nvidia. The data center is still under construction. --With assistance from Olivia Solon. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Carney-championed Net-Zero Banking Alliance shuts down after losing most of its members

Mark Carney makes a keynote address in London in 2020 ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26. Mr. Carney helped establish the Net-Zero Banking Alliance while serving as a UN special envoy on climate action and finance.POOL New/AFP/Getty Images Almost exactly four years after Prime Minister Mark Carney convinced Canada’s largest financial institutions to join a global alliance committed to net-zero emissions related to their lending, the organization is shutting down. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, which Mr. Carney helped to establish in April, 2021, while serving as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance, ceased operations Friday after losing most of its membership. Political pressure from Republican lawmakers in the United States led the alliance’s largest American members to abandon the group in late 2024. All of Canada’s largest lenders also bailed earlier this year. The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment. Analysis: Canada’s industrial carbon pricing system is a mess. Here’s how Carney can fix it When the alliance was first established ahead of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union was the sole Canadian member of the group that included 63 financial institutions from 32 countries with US$40-trillion in assets. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada jointly announced plans to join the group in October, 2021. The alliance went on to publish more than a dozen reports that, according to its website, helped almost 150 banks around the world develop climate-related business strategies and set more than 500 sectoral net-zero targets. After a widespread backlash to climate-related corporate initiatives that accelerated after the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump in November, 2024, businesses started a mass exodus from environmentally focused groups. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, the sister organization to the alliance for institutional investors that had more than 325 members managing a combined US$57.5-trillion in assets, also suspended operations in January after its largest member – BlackRock Inc. – decided to leave. Shortly before leaving the alliance, the chief executives of RBC and BMO suggested it was no longer the best mechanism for financial institutions to pursue their climate goals. “If our countries have an objective to get to a certain point, we will be part of that, and therefore pulling out of NZBA hypothetically doesn’t lead to non-commitment to net-zero climate change,” RBC chief executive Dave McKay said at a Jan. 8 conference, one week before the lender left the alliance. “It just means that mechanism, that organization that fostered oversight and policies and rules around what you can and can’t do and how you report, maybe that is not the right mechanism to do it,” he said. Speaking at the same conference, BMO chief executive Darryl White said the bank was still committed to climate transition, but added, “We also have a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers, and we will not abandon that.” “What mechanism you choose to join or bodies that you choose to align with to enforce that – that’s just a pathway,” Mr. White said. “The ultimate goal is unchanged.” Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist at Greenpeace Canada, said the collapse of the alliance highlights the limits of relying on voluntary measures. “While Mark Carney the central banker warned the world of the risk climate change posed to the financial system, Mark Carney the Prime Minister can protect our economy and environment by bringing in rules that force banks to take a longer term perspective and shift investment from fossil fuels to clean energy,” Mr. Stewart said in an e-mail.

Title: Regulators approve disputed $6.2B takeover of Minnesota Power by investment group

By STEVE KARNOWSKI and MARC LEVY, Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group’s takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates. In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power’s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility’s owner. Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S. Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change under BlackRock and that the deal’s cost wouldn’t affect electric rates. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock. The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department’s attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest. The commission’s chair, Katie Sieben, agreed. “Because of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we’ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,” Sieben said. Opposing the deal were the state attorney general’s office and industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other iron mine owners, Enbridge-run oil pipelines, and pulp and paper mills. Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with “a high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,” and “assumed the absolute worst in these investors.” But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest. Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval. “Private equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Title: BlackRock subsidiary buys up 78 data centers totaling 5 gigawatts in $40 billion deal — AI vendor Aligned added to company's portfolio

BlackRock is expanding its membership in the club of AI datacenter investors. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Another day, another blimp with billions flying the skies of AI. Today's currency transfer comes from BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an investment fund set to write a big check to buy out Aligned Data Centers, a large AI datacenter company. Bloomberg cites sources with knowledge of the deal and pins the amount at a tidy $40 billion. Aligned may not be a household name in tech news, but according to its website, the company has 78 datacenters in locations around the U.S. and South America, totaling 5 GW of processing power capacity across current and future developments. Bloomberg remarks that Aligned got a $12 billion investment in January and was one of the companies that recently met with President Trump about speeding up the country's AI development. Aligned is also attracting attention from investor AGX (backed by Mubadala Investment Co.), which apparently wants to cut a separate deal with the datacenter provider. The report remarks that the deal is set to be inked in a few days, but is not yet finalized. However, it's hard to imagine the agreement being called off in this age, where AI businesses' exponential growth has every investor under the sun tossing money at the prospect of massive short-term lucre. The $40 billion in play makes this deal one of the biggest this year, though it's still early October, and it wouldn't be surprising to see other large bets in short order. Upon completion of the deal, Aligned would be joining CyrusOne in GIP's AI datacenter portfolio. The fund's many-paged checkbook isn't going back in the drawer anytime soon, either; it's reportedly considering buying out power company AES Corp. If this news sounds familiar, it's because it's reminiscent of datacenter provider CoreWeave getting a $6.4 billion infusion from OpenAI just recently. As for Sam Altman's company, it's been cutting deals like crazy, the biggest ones a $300 billion contract with Oracle, and a $100 billion partnership with Nvidia for building 10 GW's worth of datacenters.

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ST. PAUL — Minnesota regulators signed off on the final approval needed to sell Allete to a pair of private investment firms. The five-member Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Friday voted unanimously to approve the sale of Minnesota Power’s Duluth-based parent company to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners. ADVERTISEMENT The $6.2 billion deal, announced in May 2024, drew concern over private equity’s ownership of a utility and the potential for rising electricity rates. “We are grateful to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for their thorough review and approval of this important and strategic partnership, and recognition that this is in the public interest,” Bethany Owen, chair, president and CEO of Allete, said in a news release following the decision. “Today’s decision caps a comprehensive public process and positions ALLETE well to meet the significant infrastructure demands of the clean-energy transition without compromising the high-quality service and commitments to reliability and affordability that define our company,” Owen said. The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, a consumer advocacy group, several environmental groups and Minnesota Power’s largest industrial customers were opposed to the sale, and an administrative law judge in July recommended, in a nonbinding opinion, that the PUC reject the deal as it wasn’t in the public interest. The role of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, came under particular scrutiny. Groups opposed to the deal feared Minnesota Power would favor deals that would benefit other BlackRock-owned companies at the expense of ratepayers. But Commissioner Hwikwom Ham disagreed, arguing that the fiduciary responsibility of CPP and BlackRock-owned GIP would prevent that and that the PUC itself could protect ratepayers from this in future rate cases. “The Commission’s confidence that they have the capacity, authority, and objectivity to regulate the likes of BlackRock — a financial behemoth that has tentacles in every part of the global economy — rings hollow, especially when they already oversee regular utility rate hikes that families struggle to afford,” said Maggie Schuppert, director of strategic intiatives for CURE, one of the environmental groups opposed to the deal. ADVERTISEMENT “It will fall on community and ratepayer advocates, utility watchdogs, and the public itself to hold these entities and the PUC to account and mitigate the harms of this decision,” Schuppert said. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, unions, a different consumer advocacy group and several clean energy groups supported the deal. Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer of clean energy group Fresh Energy, said the group lent its support for the sale of Minnesota Power when it decided the deal “would significantly mitigate risk to the transition to clean energy in Minnesota.” “We applaud the Commission for remaining focused on the substance of the issues at hand and what’s in the public interest of Minnesotans,” Gleckner said. Allete, which has long been publicly traded on the stock market, has maintained that going private under the ownership of GIP and CPP would allow it to more quickly and reliably access the money needed to fund its transition away from coal and carbon emissions and reach Minnesota’s law requiring 100% of the state’s electricity to be carbon-free by 2040. PUC Chair Katie Sieben said that while it “drove me nuts” to hear that the acquisition was needed to meet that law, she believed the PUC should approve the deal because investment was necessary to ensure reliability and affordability. “Whether Minnesota Power is publicly traded or privately held, it needs to comply with the laws of the state of Minnesota, including the state's 2040 carbon-free law. … Minnesota Power does need massive amounts of investment,” Sieben said. “That's not due to the state's carbon-free law necessarily, but also due to the fact that many of the utilities' assets are at end of age and need investment.” ADVERTISEMENT She added that support from commissioners came at different stages of the process, as parties involved in the proceedings reached agreements that got “it over the net benefit threshold of what would be in the public interest.” Throughout the nearly year and a half that the deal was in front of the PUC, and in particular the last few weeks, Allete, GIP and CPP have agreed to a series of commitments, including: Some PUC members said Friday that they had originally been skeptical about the deal, and Commissioner Joseph Sullivan said he had been opposed to the deal as recently as the Sept. 25 oral arguments but ultimately supported the sale Friday. “I still do have concerns in the out years … I’m concerned about what happens in the future, 10-15 years from now,” Sullivan said. “But I do think that the benefits in the near term and medium term clearly outweigh the status quo and clearly show that the partners, the parties, are taking very serious their commitment to the state.” He acknowledged the concerns residents of Northeastern Minnesota have about the deal and instructed Minnesota Power, GIP and CPP to build credibility with the public and customers. “If you don’t build that credibility,” Sullivan said, “that will redound unfavorably to everybody.” This story was updated at 2:40 p.m. Oct. 3 with details from Friday's meeting and reaction to the deal's approval. It was originally posted at 11:24 a.m. Oct. 3. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Dozens of firms are on the verge of gaining acceptance to create an ETF as one of the share classes of a mutual fund. October 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- For more than two decades, US money managers have looked on enviously as Vanguard Group reaped the benefits of a unique structure that grafted the advantages of an ETF onto its biggest mutual funds. The design, protected by patent, saved its investors billions of dollars and helped the Jack Bogle-founded firm grow into an $11 trillion giant. Now, in what could be the most consequential shift in the American investment industry in years, Vanguard is finally set to lose that competitive edge. Dozens of rival asset managers are on the brink of adopting the same structure, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission indicated it will allow the quantitative firm Dimensional Fund Advisors to do so in the coming weeks. Roughly 80 more competitors are in the queue for approval, including nearly every major name in the business. The model they want to follow creates an exchange-traded fund as one of the share classes of a mutual fund, a move that ports the famous tax efficiency of the younger structure to the older vehicle. Assuming the approvals come, it will likely trigger a wave of new ETF launches, re-write the tax and performance of countless mutual funds, and potentially finally erode the barrier that has until now largely locked ETFs out of the American retirement system. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “We already feel like we’re attached to a rocket ship, moving as fast as we can to launch more products,” said Brittany Christensen, head of business development and senior vice president at Tidal Financial Group, which helps create and run ETFs. “When I think about putting more fuel on that fire, that’s absolutely what this does.” Technical challenges to implementing the new structure remain, so the landscape won’t alter overnight. And since most major money managers already offer ETFs — having long ago given in to investor demand for the easier-to-trade, often cheaper vehicles — some market watchers have questioned how many will actually deploy it. But the size of the waitlist — more than six-times the number of firms that were racing for approval to launch Bitcoin funds — suggests huge industry-wide enthusiasm to take up the Vanguard blueprint. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said it’s “like sitting on a bunch of CDs and here’s a chance to convert them all into digital.” Asset manager giants including BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Group and Franklin Resources Inc. are among the firms seeking regulatory permission to deploy the hybrid structure. Some have been waiting for about two years, ever since Vanguard’s patent expired. Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) In a virtual meeting on Monday, the SEC told pending applicants they should conform their filings to that of DFA’s, but did not provide guarantees on when they would sign off on the next applications, according to four people familiar with the matter. BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and F/m Investments are among those that have already updated their paperwork. “This is big for the T. Rowes of this world that don’t already have super well-established ETF businesses and they’re suffering outflows from their mutual funds,” said Adam Sabban, associate director, equity strategies at Morningstar Inc. While it’s unclear if it will help generate new inflows, “it could help them retain their current assets and slow the pace of outflows,” he said. Some firms, including F/m, are looking to create mutual fund share classes of ETFs, opening the door for those products to break into 401ks. The pension system was built around mutual funds, and most platforms are not equipped to handle the intraday moves and liquidity of an ETF. Unexpectedly, even the pioneer of the ETF-within-a-mutual-fund model is on the waitlist. Vanguard only has permission to use the structure on passive funds, so the firm is now seeking approval to deploy it in active products. Related:Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs “The multi-share class ETF structure has served Vanguard index investors well for more than two decades,” said a company spokesperson. “The structure has multiple benefits for both conventional mutual fund and ETF investors, and Vanguard looks forward to bringing the benefits of the multi-share class ETF structure to investors in active funds.” Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard first introduced the model in 2001, when ETFs were still in their infancy. Recognizing its potential value, the firm obtained a patent that restricted rivals from using it until 2023. Technically, the dual share class structure remained available for other issuers, provided they agreed a licensing arrangement with Vanguard and gained exemptive relief from the SEC. But in the years since granting Vanguard approval, the watchdog developed worries relating to conflicts of interest among share classes, and no other exemptions were given. The SEC said it intends to approve DFA’s relief application later in October, unless there is a request for a hearing on the matter. “For too long, the artificial divide between mutual fund and ETF share classes has limited investor choice, operational efficiency, and resulted in suboptimal tax treatment,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said in a Monday statement. The proposed approval will facilitate competition because “similar relief has been long held by a single asset manager,” he said. The regulator said on Wednesday that owing to the government shutdown it was unable to provide further comment. The level of maturity already reached by the ETF industry may blunt the impact of the widespread use of the dual share class structure. Dave Nadig, president and director of research at etf.com, believes that any issuer with a decent approach will have pushed into ETFs years ago. Ben Fulton, CEO of WEBs Investments Inc., sees potential for this to be a “Y2K moment,” where significant time and resources are spent to achieve very little. Firms planning to deploy dual share classes face plenty of practical hurdles. A May report from JPMorgan Chase & Co. argued that launching a successful ETF strategy “is not just as simple as adding a share class to an existing mutual fund and expecting it to gain assets.” “An issuer needs to focus on the addition of capital markets services, a specific ETF distribution plan, platform strategies, and operational impacts as part of a successful launch plan,” the authors wrote. One issue is how firms will handle investors who want to switch, tax-free, from the mutual fund share class into the ETF class, to benefit from the intraday liquidity in the latter wrapper. The process is not automatic and requires both the asset manager and the individual investor to take action. “There’s some work left to be done with the platforms in terms of making that operationally more efficient,” Gerard O’Reilly, DFA’s co-CEO and co-CIO, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. DFA is hoping to have ETF share classes for a number of mutual funds available in the first couple months of 2026, he said. Meanwhile, issuers launching an ETF for the first time will need to liaise with market makers, which play a key role in keeping fund shares trading through the day — something not needed by mutual funds. If mutual fund companies launch ETF share classes en masse, it could put huge demand on the market-making ecosystem. It’s also an open question whether broker-dealers, who have strict requirements to operate in the best interest of their clients, will need to shift assets into the ETF share class, or whether they will be required to allow both share classes of the same fund on their platforms simultaneously. In a survey by Cerulli Associates in May, more than half of ETF issuers polled said “broker-dealer reluctance to approve/make share classes available on platform” was a significant challenge. “Although we’ve been working with several asset managers on operational readiness, I still think there’s going to be work for some of them — especially with the distribution channel, with the broker-dealers — to ensure that everyone’s ready for this,” said Frank Koudelka, global head of ETF Solutions at State Street. Still, the direction of travel is clear, according to Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. He said all concerns and obstacles facing the use of ETF share classes would be overcome within as little as three years. “ETFs are playing a starring role in life after mutual funds,” he said. “Their role is going to be elevated even further now.” Emily Graffeo Loukia Gyftopoulou You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Oct 1, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Title: Spiritans adding to suffering of survivors of sex abuse in their schools, says advocacy group

The Spiritan religious order has been accused of adding to the suffering of survivors abused in their schools through ongoing delays in announcing a redress scheme. The Restore Together group, which represents survivors of abuse in Blackrock College, Willow Park School, Rockwell College in Tipperary, along with St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, accused the order of a “lack of urgency” in the matter. By November last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. In a statement on Friday, Restore Together said the Spiritan order last June issued a public statement about making plans to commence a redress scheme for victims or survivors of abuse suffered at Spiritan schools. It said the order hoped to have an update by “the end of the summer”. The group said the Spiritans had not made any statement and since the end of the summer and it had been seeking a meeting with the Spiritans “to discuss urgently progressing the agreed restorative programme, but to no avail”. [ Spiritans’ promise of redress must be ‘substantiated by actions’, says abuse survivors groupOpens in new window ] This “lack of urgency is seen and felt as a further abuse of victims/survivors, one of control, by the order that abused them sexually decades ago”, the group said, adding that the Spiritans have had “more than enough time to properly address it”. In the meantime victims, survivors and their families “continue to suffer trauma daily”. This “ongoing lack of urgency” on the Spiritans’ part is “not acceptable to victims/survivors, their families and friends or Restore Together”. It called for the timely delivery of “the full programme the Spiritans have signed up” for. Otherwise, the groups said, its benefit “will be diluted, or even lost if people are made to wait too long and fight for every element of it”. [ Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victimsOpens in new window ] The group said it has been more than four years since Restore Together first engaged with the Spiritans on this, while it is “three years since we launched the Restorative Process Framework with them”. It noted that most victims and survivors are “60 or older and have carried this burden for decades”. Last June, in an open letter to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritan congregation, Provincial Fr Brendan Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. It was his “sincere hope”, Fr Carr said then, that by the end of the summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. In response to queries from The Irish Times, a spokesman for the Spiritans said they would “not be comment” on the latest Restore Together statement.

Early flows are reported around 180-190,000 bpd, well below pipeline nameplate but significant enough to hit crude benchmarks. Turkey, long resistant over the ICC arbitration ruling that saddled it with $1.5 billion in damages, signed off once it secured leverage of its own: proposals to build four refineries in northern Iraq and carve out a role beyond transit. Ankara also benefits from restored fees and influence as a corridor state, while quietly betting that U.S. pressure to ease global supply tightness will insulate it from the legal overhang. The real drivers of the breakthrough were Baghdad’s fiscal need for revenues, Erbil’s economic desperation, and Washington’s insistence on de-bottlenecking northern exports. For now, the flows are real but not at capacity, the companies are only partially back on board, and the framework is fragile. Each 30-day renewal cycle will become a bargaining round, with arrears, revenue-sharing, and arbitration liabilities still hanging over the corridor. DNO and Genel have not fully re-entered the new Baghdad–Erbil export framework, leaving Kurdistan’s flows below potential. Both firms continue producing but are diverting much of their crude into the local market rather than nominating volumes to SOMO for pipeline export. Output is being throttled (some wells left under-utilized, drilling programs paused, and operational ramp-ups on hold) a deliberate tactic to preserve leverage. Their arrears, estimated near a billion dollars, remain unpaid, and the new contract terms cap returns at a flat per-barrel service fee, far below the profit-oil model they previously operated under. With the export agreement only running on 30-day renewals through year-end, DNO and Genel are signaling they won’t sink fresh capital or restore plateau volumes until arrears and terms are resolved. The net effect is that Ceyhan flows are restarting at ~180-190 kbpd instead of approaching the 400+ kbpd capacity, highlighting that without these two operators’ full participation, northern exports will remain constrained and the political settlement fragile. The Kremlin is pushing hard against EU plans to tap frozen Russian assets, calling it theft and warning of retaliation. Brussels is weighing whether to use only the windfall interest or move toward seizing principal, with Washington pressing for the latter. Moscow is framing this as a direct attack on the sanctity of reserve holdings, with obvious implications for non-aligned states watching how safe their own money is in Western banks. Countermeasures are already being floated — expropriation of European assets still inside Russia, financial restrictions, commodity leverage. The warning lands just as Brussels debates tighter enforcement on oil sanctions, which only sharpens Moscow’s line that Europe is shifting from financial freeze to outright confiscation. Discovery & Development BP just approved a $5 billion spend on its Tiber–Guadalupe deepwater project in the U.S. Gulf, marking one of its biggest bets there in over a decade. The hub will tie in discoveries, including Tiber (2009) and Guadalupe (2014), targeting ~80,000 bpd at peak with first oil slated for 2032. BP is positioning this as part of its Paleogene push, where Chevron (CVX), Exxon (XOM) and Shell (SHEL) are also advancing high-cost but long-life plays. The move reflects a renewed appetite for mega-projects in the Gulf just as global majors juggle capital discipline with extending oil output. Exxon is trying to revive its Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique, a ~$30 billion development stalled since 2020 by insurgent violence in Cabo Delgado. CEO Darren Woods met this week with President Filipe Nyusi to push for tighter security guarantees so Exxon can restart. FID has now shifted to 2026. Rovuma would export 18 mtpa, bringing Mozambique closer to the status of Qatar and the U.S. as a top LNG supplier if it moves forward. MidOcean Energy, backed by EIG and Saudi Aramco, just bought a 20% stake in Petronas’ upstream gas assets tied to LNG Canada, one of the biggest export projects under construction. The deal plugs MidOcean into a 14 mtpa development led by Shell (SHEL) and expected online in 2025–26. LNG Canada is already oversubscribed on volumes, with Phase 2 under study that could double capacity. For Aramco, the move builds exposure to North American LNG just as Asian buyers scramble to lock in long-term supply. India has revealed a natural gas discovery in the Andaman Sea basin, a frontier area long thought to hold sizable untapped reserves. The find is being called a potential game-changer for India’s energy security, with ONGC leading exploration and officials hinting that it could open a new gas province. India imports more than half its gas, so even modest output here could ease the bill and reduce reliance on LNG cargoes. Development will hinge on further appraisal drilling and whether infrastructure can be built to move gas to demand centers on the east coast. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions Berkshire Hathaway just agreed to buy Occidental Petroleum’s OxyChem unit for $9.7B in cash, marking Warren Buffett’s largest acquisition in years. For Oxy (OXY), the sale trims debt after its $55B Anadarko buyout left the balance sheet stretched, while keeping focus on upstream oil and Permian growth. OxyChem is one of North America’s biggest PVC and chlorine producers, so Berkshire is getting a defensive cash-flow engine with long-cycle demand. The deal shows Buffett is still willing to swing big in energy, even as Oxy doubles down on crude. BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is in late-stage talks to buy AES Corp. in a $38B deal including debt. It would be one of the largest utility takeovers in U.S. history. AES has been building out renewable generation and supplying power to hyperscale data centers, making it a prime target as AI-driven electricity demand soars. For BlackRock, it’s a chance to grab a regulated cash-flow engine with growth optionality in renewables. The deal isn’t final yet, but if sealed, it would underscore how AI is reshaping utility M&A just as fast as it’s reshaping power demand. Tamboran Resources is moving to acquire Falcon Oil & Gas in a ~$172M all-stock deal, consolidating control of Australia’s Beetaloo Basin. The basin is viewed as one of the country’s biggest undeveloped shale gas plays, with Tamboran pushing to unlock LNG export potential as Asian demand rises. Falcon shareholders will get about 10% of the combined group, giving Tamboran full operatorship across key permits. The move is aimed at accelerating drilling scale and positioning Beetaloo as a future competitor to U.S. shale and Qatar LNG. BKV Corp just closed a $370M deal to buy Barnett shale assets from BHP’s old North Texas portfolio, adding ~300 MMcfe/d of production. The Barnett is mature but still cash-flowing, and BKV (already one of the top U.S. private gas producers) is betting it can squeeze more value through efficiency and scale. The acquisition lifts BKV’s footprint in the play to nearly 500,000 net acres. It’s another sign that while big publics chase LNG-linked growth, privates are still finding bargains in legacy shale gas. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Bitcoin Supercycle? Jeff Park Says Gold’s $1 Trillion Gains Could Spark It
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-supercycle-jeff-park-gold-1-trillion/
Time Published: 2025-10-03T10:15:14Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a wide-ranging interview with Anthony Pompliano published on October 2, Jeff Park, partner and Chief Investing Officer at ProCap BTC, argued that gold’s surging price and shifting global ownership patterns are not a threat to Bitcoin—but potentially the catalyst for its next structural leg higher. Park’s thesis centers on flows, geopolitics, and balance-sheet mechanics: if policymakers and large allocators learn to tap the paper gains embedded in sovereign gold holdings, they could redirect a meaningful slice of that liquidity into Bitcoin and ignite what he repeatedly framed as a supercycle. “The math is pretty simple,” Park said. “What if we find a way to unlock the ability to build leverage on the paper gains of gold to take a call option on Bitcoin? There’s something incredible here that could happen.” In his back-of-the-envelope scenario, “a trillion dollars of Bitcoin is actually hugely impactful for the bitcoin market.” He contrasted the magnitude of such an impulse with the size of the US fiscal problem, suggesting that while a trillion dollars is small relative to public debt, it would be outsized in a young asset with finite supply and thin free float. Park’s remarks were prompted by a simple question: why is gold ripping while Bitcoin has lagged on a relative basis? He did not dispute gold’s leadership—calling it “the story of the year”—but argued the drivers differ. Gold is presently the venue for acute geopolitical expression and central-bank rebalancing, while Bitcoin’s adoption curve hinges on institutional flows that are still ramping. “Ultimately [these markets] are driven by flows,” he said, adding that Bitcoin’s flows are “inevitable” so long as the institutional agenda advances with “focused deliberation.” A crucial plank of Park’s framework is the changing geography of gold. He pointed to two simultaneous realities: the headline that US gold reserves have reached a large notional value because of price—and the under-discussed fact that the US share of global official gold has sunk over decades. “At one point post-World War II the US had over 50% of the world’s global gold reserve supply as a central bank and now it’s less than 20%. So who’s making up for the compensation on their side? Likely China and many other BRIC countries in the lead.” That shift, Park argued, helps explain the persistence of gold’s bid. China, in his telling, is exerting influence not only through accumulation but also by building market infrastructure. He highlighted “the launch of the Shanghai Gold Exchange” and the rise of “the Shanghai Futures Exchange,” observing that “physical gold now actually trades in China” at a scale once associated with London. In a symbolic move earlier this year, “for the first time [they] opened up vaults in Hong Kong to allow offshore investors to put their gold in reserves,” a step Park sees as part of a longer-term strategy to enhance the creditworthiness of CNY-settled commodity trade. Park then connected this gold realignment to Bitcoin’s addressable demand. He referred to the scenario in which the US takes the massive unrealized gains on its gold if marked at market and either revalues or borrows against those gains to purchase Bitcoin for its strategic reserve under President Donald Trump. “Gold has been marked at the Treasury at $42 an ounce and we all know right now it’s trading at [roughly] 3850… There’s a trillion dollars of basically paper gains.” In that context, he argued that leveraging paper gains into a scarce digital reserve asset could be a high-beta upgrade to the sovereign balance sheet. Pressed on the political feasibility, Park distinguished between executive action and legislation. “The executive path is a great starting point to create a watershed moment,” he said, but “no democratic coalition is truly bought in until a legislative motion.” The former could demonstrate intent; the latter would make a Bitcoin reserve strategy “irreversible” and align it with the broader social mandate he associates with sound-money adoption. The crux of his “supercycle” framing is compounding. Park walked through return profiles to quantify why a large base allocation, even if financed, could matter over time. “If you own Bitcoin and you assume that it’s going to go up by 12% a year, you’ll make a 30x in 30 years… If you think it’s actually going to go up by 40% per year, which is what the [asset] has been otherwise annualizing, it’s 10 years.” He stressed that the point is not to promise those numbers, but to illustrate how modest annualized returns can cover meaningful fiscal gaps when the base is large enough and the asset is credibly scarce. Park also addressed why Bitcoin has not matched gold’s recent pace. Part of the answer, he suggested, is optics: Bitcoin is “living, breathing software” that evolves via open debate, whereas gold’s appeal is its millennia-long immutability. The transparency of Bitcoin’s governance can spook newcomers who only see the noise. “If I were outside and I was a BlackRock ETF buyer and I listened to the conversation that’s happening between the Bitcoin developers, I might say, ‘Hold on a second. This is crazy stuff.’” Even so, he framed current developer disputes—such as arguments over relay policy or spam-filter defaults—as hygiene issues, not existential ones. They matter for performance and propagation, but not for the core monetary assurances: “21 million or bust.” He invoked the lessons of the block-size war to explain why the system’s checks and balances are a feature, not a bug. “Ultimately, who is running consensus at Bitcoin?… The node clients are very valuable and they are in control versus miners and their self-interests. And that was a huge moment because it showed you decentralization was alive.” The line between hard-coded rules and socially enforced norms will always invite argument, he conceded, but in his view that process “future-proof[s] Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value.” Throughout, Park returned to flows. Gold’s flows, in his assessment, are being pulled by geopolitics and central-bank behavior—especially in Asia. Bitcoin’s flows will be pulled by institutional adoption and, potentially, by policy innovation that converts dormant balance-sheet strength into active demand. That is why he sees the assets as complements within the same macro problem set rather than rivals fighting for a single inflow. “Gold’s greatest cultural power is its impermanent fixture in our mindset and its durability for eons,” he said. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers sovereignty, portability, and programmability that younger cohorts find intuitive. “Young people are mentally more able to do things that older people can’t… the trend of young people understanding digital store of wealth… is the big picture.” I spoke with @dgt10011 on whether we should be worried about bitcoin lagging gold’s performance, durability of bitcoin vs gold, how to think about bitcoin as living software, and a new theme referencing the retardification of society.

In that world, the present period—where gold leads and Bitcoin consolidates—may be remembered not as divergence, but as staging. “Bitcoin will catch up,” Park said. “These are ultimately driven by flows.” And if those flows are seeded by the very gold rally now commanding headlines, the supercycle label he’s willing to use may not be hyperbole, but simply a description of how compounding works when new liquidity finally meets hard caps.
