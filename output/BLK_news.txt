As a delicious starter, Frank Hederman at Belvelly Smokehouse recommends serving hot smoked salmon with al dente red cabbage spiced and sweetened with caramelised onion and dried fruits, and cut with fresh ginger, orange zest and background notes of sherry vinegar. frankhederman.com Master of ceremonies at Kilkenny Savour food festival Siobhan Donohue serves the family bread sauce recipe with a splash of Highbank Orchard’s organic apple treacle. O’Keefe likes a silky butter sauce spiked with white mausu smoky chilli oil. highbankorchards.com; savourkilkenny.com A visit to Forbes Street by Gareth Mullins, in Dublin’s Docklands, is the perfect start to the season. This motorcycle-riding, Donaghmeade born and bred chef believes that a wonderful all-Irish cheese board is the perfect food for sharing with family and friends as a yuletide feast. His counsel is to “start by choosing a soft goat cheese like St Tola from Co Clare, a delicious hard, like a Coolattin cheddar from west Wicklow, a washed-rind like Gubbeen from west Cork and, of course, a blue cheese, like Cashel Blue from Tipperary. Add a good relish, some grapes, toasted nuts, organic honey and crusty bread.” forbesstreet.ie For a fragrant finish to my Christmas meal, writes Clare Anne, I will be scattering Hadji Bey’s Original Rose Turkish Delight and pomegranates across the tablescape to create an edible centrepiece to be served with Cork’s wonderful Cafe Izz Palestinian coffee. Gifts will be unwrapped too at this stage. On my list this year is a Hugo Byrne knife to slice up Tom Durkan’s award-winning spiced beef. hugobyrneknives.com; corkcity.ie Canapés, anyone? Served either warm or cold, Ireland AM regular Edward Hayden’s beef and cranberry filo tartlets, and tangy lamb skewers, are easy-to-eat, bite-sized morsels that feature meat from O’Brien Butchers and John Stone. obrienbutchers.ie; johnstonebeef.com At a soirée at the home Katia Valadeau of ProperFood.ie a simple platter is served, consisting of smoked trout with crème fraîche, capers, shaved onions, lemon zest, dill and black pepper, topped with Irish caviar, specifically, Goatsbridge trout caviar. goatsbridgetrout.ie Bettina Lopes, a wine expert and co-owner of Little Italy, in Smithfield, Dublin 7, advocates an Italian aperitivo approach to party bites. She piles ricotta and truffle or delicious pistachio pesto on to slices of mortadella on ciabatta, served with an Amarena Spritz, the Italian cherry syrup with prosecco and a splash of Campari, or simply Amarena cherries dropped into Sanbitter Dry, to create a non-alcoholic festive spritz. She also brings a panettone as a host gift. littleitalyltd.com A walk, followed by time in your local, is a great way to gather with friends at Christmas. For Clare Anne, this usually means a tramp around the Phoenix Park to see the deer, followed by a glass of punch at L Mulligan Grocer, where Seáneen Sullivan, a food and folklore scholar, is the mixologist. Her party punch is made of one part lemon juice, two parts simple sugar syrup, three parts Longueville House apple brandy to four parts soda water – to be added when ordered, just before serving over ice, she explains. She chills the mixture, minus the soda water, in bottles and has it in her fridge to serve to guests or to bring to a party as a last-minute yet thoughtful gift. Her non-alcoholic version features Irish apple juice, cordials from Naturally Cordial in Wexford and a tonic from Poacher’s range. lmulligangrocer.com At home I shuck my own shells and add a teaspoon of ice-cold, Cuinneog, Irish farmhouse natural buttermilk, to my au nature bivalves. For a festive treat I book a table at Allta Bar and Bottle Shop, in Dublin’s Three Locks Square, where Cromane oysters are on the menu. I enjoy them with a drop of Allta’s house-made fermented chilli sauce. allta.ie Publican turned organic farmer Mick Foggarty’s Christmas highlight is his St Stephen’s Day sandwich. This features the usual leftovers but Mick’s secret is to add crushed bacon fries to the mix; he recommends picking up a pack in the pub on Christmas Eve before you leave. This whiskey expert and farmer of Beechpark Eco Farm, who is a fan of Crowe Farm’s outdoor-raised Bronze turkeys, sets out strict rules about how to construct this morning-after cure. [ It’s the most eagerly anticipated sandwich of the year. Here’s how to make yours epicOpens in new window ] “Heat your turkey in the leftover gravy and fry up the leftover veg,” says Mick. “Get two slices of bread and spread one side of each with cranberry sauce. Add the hot meat and gravy to the cranberry sauce side of one slice of bread and then top with the vegetables, crush the bacon fries and put them on top of the vegetables and then top with the other slice of bread, sauce side down. Cut in half, eat and say goodbye to that Christmas hangover.” beechparkfarm.com; crowefarm.ie Run out of fridge space? Don’t just think outside the box – think outside the house, says chef and author Graham Herterich: “When I need extra space in the fridge for the Christmas Day prep, I do a clear-out of half jars of condiments or vegetables or anything that’s not very perishable from the fridge and they move to either the boot of the car or a secure box outside for few days. “They’ll be grand outside in the cold, and it means we’ve loads of room then for all the extra Christmas meats and stuff like that.” Santa is not the only one who needs a list, says cook and food writer William Murray: “A key tool of experienced cooks and chefs is an ‘order of work’, a detailed yet straightforward list and plan of attack for the big day with times and jobs. Things like getting your prep done, when to preheat the oven, what to put in the oven in what order etc. “Some of these things might seem obvious but, trust me, having a detailed plan to refer to on the day is essential, especially if you tend to be messy like me. And don’t forget the delegation of jobs to others.” Ikea is not a place most of us would think about picking up Christmas food but it’s a must for Mickael Viljanen, chef-patron of two-Michelin-starred Chapter One. He pairs Ikea gingerbread biscuits with Cashel Blue for a Christmas Eve treat: “They’re delicious together with a lovely glass of wine, like a dry Riesling.” He’s also into adding some sweetness to his stuffing: “Instead of using normal breadcrumbs, I blitz up a loaf of brioche into breadcrumbs. It soaks up the fat and flavours much better, and makes a much tastier stuffing. I like to add some dried cranberries to mine, as well as the usual herbs.” Chef Barry Sun of Volpe Nero in Dublin is also thinking ahead about snacks when he’s planning: “I always purchase the makings of some simple snacks to serve with Christmas drinks. I like to slice and toast good quality sourdough, add a drizzle of olive oil, a spoon of stracciatella, finish with anchovy fillets and season. Simple but always impressive”. A whole turkey can often be too much if you’re cooking for a smaller number, says Carol Barrett, owner of Dunmore House Hotel in Co Cork. To avoid any waste, she recommends asking your butcher to take off the legs and mince the leg meat, to be used another time. “It’s great for a bolognese pasta or burgers in the new year,” says Barrett. “This also makes your turkey crown easier to roast and manage.” To brine or not to brine is often a question when it comes to Christmas turkey. Chef Dan Hannigan is firmly in the brining camp. “I always brine my turkey,” he says. “It imparts extra flavour – and not just for the turkey. A sneaky little extra tip would be to reserve some of your brine and add cabbages cut into four pieces, with the root left on, for a couple of hours, and then pan fry them when cooking the dinner for the most sensational cabbage of your life.” Or how about jazzing up shop-bought cranberry sauce? Sateesh Sayana, chef-patron of Ruchii restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, spices his jarred sauce with sliced apple and pears. “Toss them in a pan with butter, bay leaves, cinnamon and sugar. Once the fruits have caramelised, add to the cranberry sauce. This little addition will elevate the tart cranberry flavour and show your guests you went to a little extra effort when serving your turkey and ham.” If you’re catering for vegetarians and vegans, don’t forget to ditch the duck fat when roasting your spuds. Instead, Holly White offers advice for getting perfect crispy potatoes that will satisfy everyone at the table. “To boost the flavour of my roast potatoes once they are parboiled I coat them in lots of crushed garlic, thyme and olive oil before roasting them in a hot oven until crisp. I make sure to shuffle them halfway through, breaking up the edges, allowing them to absorb all the flavours, and then serve them piping hot and seasoned well.” There’s nothing quite like a freshly baked mince pie at Christmas but making the real deal can be laborious. Instead, JR Ryall, head pastry chef at Ballymaloe House, has a quick-fix idea he calls “a festive game-changer”: bite-size mince pie turnovers. “They’re so much quicker to assemble than traditional mince pies, and the best part is that they can be baked straight from the freezer,” says Ryall. “Every year, in late November, I set aside some time to make a batch. I simply fold a small circle of pastry over a spoonful of mince-pie filling, creating little half-moon pies, seal the edges, and freeze them on trays. Once they’re frozen, I store them in an airtight container, ready to be baked whenever Christmas visitors arrive. No special baking tray required.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Today, the city is exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its financial system. Vancouver City Council voted Wednesday to explore ways to make the city "Bitcoin-friendly," taking a bold step into crypto despite potential regulatory hurdles. The controversial motion, spearheaded by Mayor Ken Sim, was approved at the City Council's Standing Committee meeting on Wednesday. Specifically, the motion directs council staff to explore accepting taxes and fees in Bitcoin and converting part of the city’s financial reserves into Bitcoin to protect against inflation and currency volatility. Thirty-four people spoke to the motion, with supporters from ABC Vancouver and opposition from Green Party members. Sim is a party member of the former. While the approval doesn't immediately commit the city to crypto investments, it initiates a comprehensive study of potential Bitcoin integration into municipal finances. However, the directive faces immediate roadblocks. The British Columbia Ministry of Municipal Affairs confirmed that crypto isn't currently recognized as a legal form of payment for municipalities, explicitly stating that local governments cannot hold financial reserves in crypto. Sim, who has disclosed that he has investments in Coinbase Global and Purpose Bitcoin ETF, remained undeterred. "Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years," Sim said in an interview with Canadian news outlet Global News before the vote. "To not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless," he added. The council chamber saw divided opinions among its members. ABC Councilor Peter Meiszner, while voting in favor, expressed caution about the difference between private and public crypto investment. Meanwhile, Green Councilor Pete Fry opposed the motion, citing money laundering concerns previously raised by the Vancouver Police Department. "Governments have to catch up," Sim said, pledging a personal $10,000 Bitcoin donation to the city regardless of the vote's outcome. Environmental implications also emerged as a key point of contention. Councilor Adriane Carr highlighted worries about Bitcoin's electricity demands, which are particularly relevant given recent council debates about the city's power grid capacity. Decrypt has reached out to ABC Vancouver for comments on how this could be implemented once the feasibility study is completed. The approved motion directs city staff to return with a feasibility report by Q1 2025, examining potential crypto integration into municipal operations and investment strategies. That timeline coincides with the broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, including recent moves by major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity. Bitcoin is trading at just over $100,000, a price milestone that it reached 15 years after Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator, envisioned a financial revolution.

Title: Future proofing: BlackRock’s billionaire bonanza and putting talent to work

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is adding a clutch of new billionaires to its payroll. Photo / 123RF OPINION BlackRock has bought a bonanza of billionaires. Now comes the challenge of keeping them in line. The world’s largest asset manager has been on a US$28 billion ($48.2b) acquisition tear, snapping up two of the best known firms that specialise in the complex and rapidly growing fields of infrastructure, private credit and other alternative assets. To gain a stronger foothold, the US$11.5 trillion money manager has opted to pay dearly for outside talent and take steps to ensure that it sticks around long enough to make a difference. Last week’s US$12b-plus deal for private credit specialist HPS will make billionaires of Scott Kapnick and the other two founders, but they will be paid out over a five-year period and the final total is contingent on the deal meeting performance targets. Similarly, BlackRock’s US$12.5b purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners earlier this year has collectively made five GIP founders the second largest BlackRock shareholder, and it too has a five-year payout. The £2.55b ($5.6b) deal for private markets data provider Preqin is an all-cash transaction so it places fewer constraints on founder Mark O’Hare, but he had already stepped down as chief executive in 2022. With nine new billionaires due to come on the payroll, BlackRock founder Larry Fink is moving quickly to put them to work. The top two GIP executives have already joined BlackRock’s global executive committee and the three HPS founders will follow suit. GIP chair Adebayo Ogunlesi also sits on the BlackRock board of directors, while Kapnick will become an observer. In theory, that all makes good sense. While BlackRock has built a commanding position in traditional asset management and associated technology, its private markets business has historically punched below its weight. Ogunlesi and Kapnick are towering Wall Street figures, with entrepreneurial chops in precisely the areas where the larger firm wants to grow. Each has staked his personal wealth and substantial reputation on becoming part of what Fink likes to refer to as “One BlackRock”, with all the cross-selling and joint product development that implies. In practice, management meetings with that many newly minted billionaires in the room are going to be something to behold. These are men accustomed to running their own shows. Now they must deal with one another, the other BlackRock executives, and the constraints of being part of a 20,000-employee public company. Fink, of course, is more than qualified to play ringmaster to his newly recruited private capital lions. They may have created highly profitable boutiques, but he has built a global juggernaut and run it for more than 35 years. He also has experience with integrating multiple bet-the-farm acquisitions, including the 2006 deal for Merrill Lynch’s asset management arm and the 2009 purchase of Barclays Global Investors. That invites the question of what happens after Fink, who recently turned 72, steps back. Before the HPS deal, he had been walking a fine line between saying he still loved his job while also assuring investors that he had “no higher priority” than ensuring a smooth succession. Last January, the company granted chunky stock option packages to three men it described as “senior leaders who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock’s future”. Rob Goldstein, Martin Small, and Mark Wiedman are longtime BlackRock managers, rather than entrepreneurs like the new arrivals. “Buying an entrepreneurial business is very risky because entrepreneurs drive it in a particular way and managers don’t ... They don’t fit together particularly well,” says Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert. BlackRock could tap one of the HPS or GIP leaders to replace Fink, but each firm is so highly specialised that BlackRock watchers find it hard to imagine the leader of one or the other at the top of the gigantic financial supermarket that the company has become. Fink currently shows no sign of slowing down. He has been on the road all year visiting clients and political leaders, including recent high profile stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. He also sounded energised on last week’s investor call about the challenges of integration and the prospects of combining HPS with BlackRock’s offerings. Still, investors and BlackRock’s board cannot afford to be complacent. The company is due to appoint a new lead independent director in 2025. That person should take a fresh look at transition planning and consider whether the pool of possible candidates is large and deep enough. The bigger Fink’s shoes grow, the harder they will be to fill. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Merely 0.55% of shareholders supported a proposal for buying and holding Bitcoin. The leading crypto by market capitalization surpassed $100,000 per coin once again on Wednesday. According to the annual Microsoft Investor Relations report, 28.234 million Microsoft shareholder votes were cast in favor of the proposal, compared to an overwhelming 5.148 billion against, with 22.6 million abstentions. Microsoft’s board of directors urged shareholders to vote down the proposal ahead of the shareholder vote, citing the cryptocurrency’s volatility. “Bitcoin is a more volatile asset, at the moment than corporate bonds, so companies should not risk shareholder value by holding too much of it,” Microsoft said during the shareholder meeting. “However, as Bitcoin is an excellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation and corporate bond yields are less than the true inflation rate, companies should also not risk shareholder value by ignoring Bitcoin altogether.” While the majority of shareholders rejected the proposal, Microsoft acknowledged that companies should evaluate the benefits of holding at least 1% of their assets in Bitcoin. The Microsoft shareholder's ultimate vote comes as several companies begin to stack the asset on their balance sheets this year as part of their corporate strategies. Earlier this month, healthcare technology company, Semler Scientific, added $30 million in Bitcoin. On Monday, the National Center for Public Policy recommended Amazon convert at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. A decision is expected sometime next year in the Spring. Microsoft highlighted Microstrategy as the largest private Bitcoin holder. This company recently acquired an additional $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 423,650 BTC, valued at approximately $42 billion. “Microstrategy—which, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet—has had its stock outperform Microsoft stock this year by 313% despite doing only a fraction of the business that Microsoft has. And they’re not alone,” according to a proxy statement. “The institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin is becoming more commonplace. Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, offers its clients a Bitcoin ETF.” Despite rejecting the Bitcoin proposal, Microsoft noted that it evaluates a wide range of assets to invest. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team said it will continue to monitor trends related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency “to inform future decision-making.” “As the proposal itself notes, volatility is a factor to consider in evaluating cryptocurrency investments for corporate treasury applications that require stable and predictable investments to ensure liquidity and operational funding,” Microsoft said.

Title: Business cycle remains a real risk for markets

Whatever 2025 holds for world markets, talk of an end to business cycle investing eerily reflects past periods of hubris and makes all the persistent bullishness seem slightly reckless. The years since 2020 have been extraordinary, with pandemic-distorted supply and demand patterns that are still playing out. Serial geopolitical shocks and mega trends in technology and green energy have followed. Amidst all that, inflation in Western economies recorded its biggest spike in 40 years, and central banks scrambled to snuff it out with the most brutal credit tightening in decades. But setting aside the deep but brief pandemic-induced economic contraction in early 2020, the United States has managed to avoid a recession. And few if any forecasters see one unfolding next year. For BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, it is simply different this time. "We've argued since 2020 that we are not in a business cycle," it said in its 2025 outlook. "Historical trends are being permanently broken in real time as mega forces, like the rise of artificial intelligence, transform economies." Ignoring the business cycle is a big call and certainly a brave one at this stage. Yet, looking at the United States over the past few years, it's hard to argue against it. Previously near foolproof bellwethers of cyclical downturns, such as the inverted yield curve or the 'Sahm Rule' on when rising joblessness presages a downturn -- have flashed bright red, but to no avail. US real GDP has expanded continuously since a one-quarter contraction in the first three months of 2022 and as 2024 comes to a close, growth rates are still well above trend at more than 3%. If anything, that looks set to be underscored by both lower interest rates and tax cuts next year. Even the most dogged bears on Wall Street have thrown in the towel, seemingly assured that the services-dominated US economy can sail on unfettered. Most of the big brokers expect further punchy gains for Wall Street stocks in 2025. The already expensive S&P 500, still led mostly by a narrow group of mega-cap tech giants, is set to record its second consecutive year of 25%-plus gains for the first time since 1998. RESONATING MILESTONES All the same, comparisons to the late 1990s should ring some alarm bells. The final years on the last century were certainly different to today but there are also uncanny parallels with the present, including mounting euphoria about a US-dominated technology, a turbulent world economy and seemingly Teflon US growth. The end of the Cold War had given rise to many hubristic books, most famously Francis Fukuyama's bestseller The End of History and the Last Man on the durable triumph of liberal democracy. By the end of the decade, the internet bubble gave vent to endless talk about business cycle being transcended in the face of transformative technology and US exceptionalism. What's more, there were also a few hesitant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts that kept the expansion going before eventually being reversed as the economy dodged turbulence abroad and the domestic bubble grew bigger. The upshot? A tech-led bubble burst in 2000, ushering in three years of consecutive S&P 500 losses -- the longest series of annual downturns since World War II. It took seven years to recover the peaks of 2000, just before the banking crash hit. To be sure, anyone who stuck with durable tech names that survived the dot.com bust made a fortune over the past 20 years. But the business and investment cycle was far from ending. TEFLON ECONOMY So what could go wrong now? Even if there is a cogent argument for continued US economic and market outperformance next year, it's hard to see how America remains entirely insulated if there is significant economic weakness overseas. Asset managers' 2025 outlooks all dwell heavily on the uncertainties surrounding the incoming administration of US president-elect Donald Trump. And they all acknowledge that some type of trade war is in the offing, with China, Europe and even US neighbours Canada and Mexico all in the crosshairs. A global economic hit from tit-for-tat tariff salvos and investment curbs could come back to haunt the United States if it stymies world demand or lifts US prices, causing the Fed to halt or reverse its policy easing. BlackRock's view, for the record, is that the US and global economies may well experience bouts of turbulence in the coming year. But their conclusion is that such moves would only impact tactical trades and that major investment decisions should stay focused on multi-year big themes, such as artificial intelligence and green energy. But even if the United States can remain an "oasis of prosperity", in the words of another famed phrase from the late 1990s, financial distortions could eventually sow the seeds of an eventual fall. Monetary easing around the world has already accelerated, potentially in response to trade fears. This is buoying the dollar and holding down US Treasury yields, too, as investors rotate into what's now become a high-yielding "safe asset". Some argue that inappropriately low US long-term borrowing rates could, by themselves, catalyse a downfall by overheating the economy and further inflating asset bubbles. That scenario suggests that any downturn likely wouldn't come next year. But the rumoured death of the business cycle may yet prove to be greatly exaggerated.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to look at where EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) stands against other most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in. On November 4, the Canadian government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced preliminary regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the oil and gas sector by 35% from 2019 levels over the next eight years. These regulations are set to be implemented through a cap-and-trade system, which will establish a legal limit on the sector’s emissions, allowing companies to buy and sell a limited number of emissions allowances. The cap is expected to be enforced starting in 2030, with gradual reductions until Canada achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan is set to be finalized in the coming year and phased in starting in 2026. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has expressed concerns that the cap will lead to production cuts and a reduction in business investment. The effectiveness and implementation of this policy remains uncertain, as the governing Liberal Party faces a significant challenge from the Conservative Party, which is leading in the polls ahead of the next election, scheduled no later than October 2026.

In an interview with CNBC on September 11, Katie Stockton, Founder of Fairlead Strategies discussed the potential for a natural gas trade as the market shows signs of basing and improving momentum. Stockton began by noting that natural gas prices have experienced a significant decline, with a 75% drop from September 2022. This dramatic decrease has put natural gas in a long-term downtrend, making it a challenging and volatile asset to trade. One of the key indicators Stockton highlighted is the long-term momentum gauge for natural gas prices. For the first time since the beginning of 2023, this gauge has flipped to a buy signal, indicating a significant shift in the long-term trend. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that the downward momentum may be reversing. Additionally, natural gas has been showing signs of basing for several months, which is a positive signal for potential upside movement. Stockton also pointed out that short-term momentum has been improving. Natural gas futures have recently moved above their 50-day moving average, a key technical level that often signals short-term strength. The prices are now testing the 200-day moving average, another critical resistance level. Breaking through this level could trigger more buying interest and potentially lead to a sustained upward trend. Natural gas has become a key part of the world’s energy supply, serving as a bridge between traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. This increased demand is expected to help stabilize prices and open up new opportunities for investors. To compile our list of the 8 most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest gas companies. We shortlisted companies with a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% and a minimum net income of $1 billion in the trailing twelve months (TTM) as informed by SeekingAlpha. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 46 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 19.01% TTM Net Income: $7.14 Billion EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was established in 1985 and is based in Houston, Texas. The company along with its subsidiaries, engages in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas, primarily in active basins within the United States, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and other international locations. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is making strategic infrastructure investments that are designed to ensure that the company can capitalize on the growing demand for North American natural gas. The company is building the Janus gas plant in the Delaware Basin, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Furthermore, the company has completed the Verde pipeline, which will be primarily used to transport natural gas extracted from the Dorado play in South Texas to the Agua Dulce hub in Texas to allow the company to access the Gulf Coast market. The company is optimistic that new LNG projects, exports to Mexico, and increased power generation will drive about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day of new LNG capacity starting in 2025 and continuing through 2027. To capitalize on this trend, EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) in 2022, announced to drill 25 wells using two rigs in the Dorado area, which is part of the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations. However, during the Q3 earnings call, management informed that the company now plans to continue a one-rig program in the Dorado area to improve efficiency and deepen its understanding of the play. The company estimates that Dorado holds about 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas with a production cost of less than $1.25 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Overall, EOG ranks 3rd on our list of one of the most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of EOG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Gareth 'Gaz' Smith Well-known Dublin chef Gareth ‘Gaz’ Smith has said his popular Blackrock restaurant Big Mike’s is continuing on despite financial difficulties and the jobs of his employees “are secure”. A notice on the Big Mike’s website noted that a “process adviser” had been appointed to the company behind the restaurant. The appointment of a process adviser is part of the Small Company Administrative Rescue Process (SCARP). In order for a company to avail of the scheme, it must be “fundamentally viable and capable of trading its way out of its current difficulties,” according to the Department of Enterprise. Under the scheme, the process adviser is tasked with putting together a rescue plan for the business and working with creditors to consolidate debts. Mr Smith has confirmed the restaurant started the SCARP process and said there is “a really strong business model in place”. He said the team at Big Mike’s is moving forward “with their head high and chests out”. “We’re three weeks into the seven-week Government SCARP process, and things are progressing well,” Mr Smith said in a statement. "Our ambitious project resulted in huge fit out costs from Covid days (when materials costs were 4-5 times the norm) and we’ve tried our very best to maintain those repayments out of cash flow, and we need a pressure release from that. As confirmed by the comprehensive SCARP report. “We’ve a really strong business model in place with options and support in the background. Jobs are secure, vouchers will be honoured, suppliers have been incredible, and our team is moving forward with their heads high and chests out.” Mr Smith said “it would be irresponsible” for him as an employer “not to do everything in my power” to keep staff on the restaurant’s payroll rather than the Government’s He said there has been “exceptional” engagement and good faith from all parties involved, including Revenue, lenders, suppliers, and the process facilitators, and this is the reason the business is already halfway through the SCARP process. “There’s no sugarcoating it – this isn’t easy – but it’s a lot better than the alternative. We’re staying focused, proactive, and optimistic about the future,” he added. “Very often the whispers are ten times worse than the truth, we’ve been incredibly transparent with everybody and everybody has shown incredible support, we’re very grateful for the goodwill.” In July of this year, Mr Smith confirmed the closure of his Mount Merrion-based restaurant Michael’s in order to concentrate his business on Big Mike’s, with staff from Michael’s taking up positions at the Blackrock location.

Title: Why Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Self-Driving Technology Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-alphabet-inc-googl-best-185237926.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. For an alternative list that focuses on the best autonomous driving car companies, please visit 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 202 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. While it relies primarily on its search engine and advertising to account for nearly 70% of its revenue, the firm also plays a key role in the autonomous driving industry through its Waymo business. Waymo is one of the few companies in the US whose cars regularly travel on roads to finetune their self-driving capabilities. Yet, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Waymo have also been dealt setbacks from the inherent risks of autonomous driving platforms being vulnerable to accidents. On the flip side, Waymo’s prowess with self-driving also provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a commanding position in a market that can grow in the future. As a whole, the narrative depends on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s dominance in the search engine market and its ability to fend off any legal troubles that might head its way. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) stands against other best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The alternative fuel and renewable energy industry is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. Examples of alternatives include wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel energy. According to the Business Research Company, the global alternative fuel or renewable energy market was valued at $1.10 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.55 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Growing environmental concerns and stringent environmental regulations in many developed countries have significantly boosted the renewable energy sector, leading to an increase in installed capacity for renewable sources. The increasing power demand and energy consumption are also key drivers of the growing demand in the alternative or renewable fuels industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to increase by 3.4% annually by 2026, with 85% of this additional demand coming from China and India. India’s electricity demand alone is predicted to grow by over 6% annually until 2026, driven by economic growth and rising air conditioning use. Southeast Asia is also expected to see a 5% annual increase in electricity demand through 2026. In the United States, a moderate rise in electricity demand is anticipated in the coming years, primarily driven by data centers. The electricity consumption by data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency could potentially double to 1,000 TWh by 2026. The IEA forecasts that the surge in electricity generation from low-emission sources will meet global demand growth over the next three years, with renewable energy expected to surpass coal as the leading energy source by early 2025.

On November 11, Reuters reported that hedge funds rapidly increased their investments in bank stocks, marking the fastest pace in three years, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in renewable energy companies, according to a note from Goldman Sachs. This shift in investment strategy came in response to Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Financial stocks, including banks, have become the most favored and most net-purchased sector on Goldman’s prime brokerage trading desk. Additionally, hedge funds placed long bets on consumer finance, capital markets, and financial services companies, with a focus on US stocks and equities in developing Asia and Europe, where they exited short positions and added long ones. In contrast, utility companies, especially independent power, and renewable electricity producers faced heavy selling, with hedge funds taking two short positions for every long position in U.S. utility companies. Despite short-term challenges, the rapid growth and increasing investment in alternative fuel and renewable energy reflects a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. As renewable technologies continue to advance and become more cost-effective, they are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for new energy projects worldwide.

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s December Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) stands against other stocks to watch in Jim Cramer’s December portfolio. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the evolution of AI and how the technology has come from being ignored as “hype” to now completely changing everyday lives for many. Cramer mentioned the AI solutions offered by Marc Benioff’s company and said the technology is actually exceeding expectations “dramatically.” [read Marc Benioff’s latest comments here] Cramer mentioned the comments of Benioff on his company’s new AI-powered solutions: “Suddenly, though, we have Agent Force, and with it, Marc said, I quote, “We’re unleashing this new year of digital labor force for every business and every industry.” He went on to say, quote, “The implications are just simply profound. Now people ridicule me for saying how much we need AI, but Marc says, quote, ‘For decades, economic growth depended on expanding the human workforce. It was all about getting more labor,’ end quote. Not anymore—not with agents powered by AI who, as you’re stating, can work faster, doing tedious things but essential jobs that nobody wants.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A row of shelves in a retail pharmacy, demonstrating the variety of drugs and over-the-counter products. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 63 Talking about CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Jim Cramer said in a recent program on CNBC that he’s waiting to see where the stock bottoms and said he sees “maybe” another bad quarter for the company. “I’ve been waiting to see where it could bottom, and Deutsche Banks taking the leap might be a little too early because there could be one more bad quarter. But it’s worth talking about, and I think it’s good. It’s better than Honeywell, which is down five, because they don’t know how to tell the story.” Cramer said CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) new CEO David Joyner is doing a “good job.” What ails CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is the rising competition. CVS has expanded beyond retail, particularly after acquiring Aetna in 2018, but retail and pharmacy sales still account for around 50% of its total revenue. The pharmacy services segment is facing growing competition from non-traditional retailers like Kroger, Walmart, and Costco, as well as from new disruptors like Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon, which has expanded into healthcare and pharmaceutical sales. Retail margins are also under pressure, with competitors offering cheaper prescriptions and household goods. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) market share in pharmacy services has only grown modestly, from 23.8% in 2017 to 25.7% in 2023, despite significant acquisitions. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) has spent $96.6 billion on deals like Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street Health. Meanwhile, CVS’s long-term debt has risen sharply, from $25.1 billion in 2017 to $65 billion, and shares outstanding have grown at an annual rate of 3.5%. Coho Relative Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “While we believe each of those companies is performing in line with or better than our expectations and that the moves lower are unjustified, both CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Nike reported disappointing performance in recent results. In CVS’ case, management gave an optimistic outlook to 2024 at its December Investor Day, which we believed was consistent with our expectations. Unfortunately, management misestimated its medical loss ratio and the anticipated profitability in its book for Medicare Advantaged lives. This triggered a position paper violation, as the company’s financial flexibility now looks constrained in both 2024 and 2025.” Overall, CVS ranks 4th on our list of stocks to watch in Jim Cramer’s December portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of CVS, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks. As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, experts are increasingly focusing on how its integration will impact investment strategies. The growth of AI presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, not only by targeting leading tech companies but also by considering the broader ecosystem, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. In a CNBC interview, Jay Jacobs from BlackRock and ETF expert Dave Nadig discussed the future of ETFs in 2025, particularly focusing on the accelerating phase of AI infrastructure. Jacobs highlighted that AI adoption is still in its early stages, with significant investments being made by megacap tech companies in data centers, chips, and model training. He emphasized the importance of looking beyond just the tech giants, as other sectors like semiconductors, data centers, and software companies are poised to benefit from AI. Jacobs also pointed out that cybersecurity investments are becoming more crucial as the value of data grows. Nadig added that AI's impact will also extend to infrastructure sectors, especially power, and emphasized the importance of retail companies integrating AI into consumer devices. Finally, both experts acknowledged the growing importance of physical infrastructure, such as electricity, data centers, and materials like copper, in supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies.

Currently, OpenAI offers a $20-per-month plan for consumers and a $200 option for access to more powerful models. The company also charges businesses on a per-user basis. In the future, Friar suggested the possibility of a value-based pricing model for AI products, based on the benefits companies gain, such as automating tasks and reducing the need for additional employees. This approach could help offset the high costs of developing AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Title: Is SoFi Technologies (SOFI) the Worst ARK Stock to Buy According to Short Sellers?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Worst ARK Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) stands against other worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. Cathie Wood of ARK Investment is one of Wall Street’s most well-known hedge fund bosses. In a hedge fund industry dominated by players that focus on quantitative trading, value stocks, and balanced portfolios, Wood stands out from the pack by focusing on disruptive innovation and firms that she and her firm believe will change the world. This relentless focus on change means that if the economy is facing turbulence, then markets are not kind to Wood. To understand how: consider the cumulative value of her firm’s holdings as indicated by its 13F SEC filings. Starting from Q3 2020, analyzing the value for each subsequent year’s third quarter reveals how Ark Invest’s fortune fluctuates with economic winds. The hedge fund’s holdings were valued at $16.8 billion, $41.6 billion, $14.3 billion, and $13 billion during Q3 2020, Q3 2021, Q3 2022, and Q3 2023, respectively. This shows that the value of Ark Invest’s holdings jumped by 148% between the third quarters of 2020 and 2021. Looking back to see why, market conditions back then were marked by easy liquidity, a surge in retail investing, and Wall Street’s bullishness for technology stocks. Technology and growth stocks are precisely the kinds that Wood invests in, and in the time period being analyzed, the shares of Elon Musk’s car company alone soared by 87%. Wood is one of the firm’s largest investors, and her patience has yielded results. Insider Monkey’s data shows that Ark Invest first bought the shares at an average price of $13.14 during Q4 2016. While it has grown its holdings from the 274,725 shares held back then to 4.6 million shares as of Q3 2024, even if Wood hadn’t bought additional shares, her original holdings would currently be worth $62.7 million right now for a remarkable 1,508% gain! Yet, while Musk’s company is Wood’s greatest hit, there have been misses as well since the idea of investing in disruptive innovation carries the unavoidable pitfall of targeting some firms that fail to deliver on lofty ideas. We analyzed the share price performance of some of her longest-held stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. At the time the list was published, its three worst-performing stocks were down by 81.85%, 95.11%, and 99% since 2020 end. Extrapolating their performance to December 2024, the first two stocks, which rank 2nd and 4th have lost 75% and 94.5%. At the heart of Ark Invest’s trading strategy is the fund’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund. Over the past five years, this fund has gained a modest 23% which is substantially lower than the flagship S&P index’s 93.5%. Zooming into its 2024 performance, this fund has gained 20.5% while the index is up by 28.3%. Wood’s ETF’s performance can also be divided into pre and post-election gains. Before the election, it was down 7.6% year-to-date after having bled 13% during H1 2024. As H1 ended, Wood acknowledged the troubling time her firm was facing in an investor letter. She admitted “fully that the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but went on to add that her firm’s “conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.” According to Wood, Ark had to remain persistent back then since exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years.” The mean reversion she is referring to is the differential in the performance between the Russel Value and Growth stock indexes in the infamous dot-com bubble. Wood pointed out that “At its worst in 2000, the Russell Value Index underperformed the Russell Growth Index by more ~3,500 basis points on a year-over-year basis but, within roughly one year, the relative performance flipped and reached a positive ~4,800 basis points, more than an 80-percentage point swing, as shown below.” She believes that Ark’s strategy to diversify away from the Magnificent 6 (Magnificent 7 ex Tesla) through “increased exposure to multiomics stocks that have been hit hardest by “higher for longer” interest rates” led to disappointing performance. The potential upside from this diversification was evident in 2023 as the flagship fund “appreciated 68% as the bull market started to broaden out based on just the “whiff” of lower interest rates, despite its diversification away from the Magnificent Six and toward what we believe are more disruptive names,” according to Wood. To wit, while the flagship fund was down 7.6% YTD before the election after the ballots were cast and counted, it has gained 26% to bring its YTD performance to 20.46%. The benchmark S&P index, on the other hand, is up by 28.3%. For our list of the worst Ark stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the 110 largest holdings in Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 SEC filings by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the highest percentage. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A professional banker shaking hands with an entrepreneur in a boardroom setting. Short Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 13.70% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 31 Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 Stake: $99.1 million SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a sizable financial services provider based in San Francisco, California. It provides lending services, financial technology products, and benefits management products among others. The firm depends heavily on interest income to fund its operations. As of H1 2024, SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) earned $1.3 billion in interest income and $428 million in noninterest income. Consequently, a lower interest rate environment could play out in its favor as services such as loan refinancing, mortgages, and personal loans see greater demand from consumers. The bulk of SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s interest income is from loans, and the firm’s noninterest income comes from various areas such as its technology platforms. In H1, income from technology platforms grew by 11% to somewhat mitigate the effects of a 48% drop in loan origination income due to high interest rates. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s management commented on its outlook of a relaxed regulatory environment during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We’ve achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Overall, SOFI ranks 9th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of SOFI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOFI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

While it has grown its holdings from the 274,725 shares held back then to 4.6 million shares as of Q3 2024, even if Wood hadn’t bought additional shares, her original holdings would currently be worth $62.7 million right now for a remarkable 1,508% gain! Yet, while Musk’s company is Wood’s greatest hit, there have been misses as well since the idea of investing in disruptive innovation carries the unavoidable pitfall of targeting some firms that fail to deliver on lofty ideas. We analyzed the share price performance of some of her longest-held stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. At the time the list was published, its three worst-performing stocks were down by 81.85%, 95.11%, and 99% since 2020 end. Extrapolating their performance to December 2024, the first two stocks, which rank 2nd and 4th have lost 75% and 94.5%. At the heart of Ark Invest’s trading strategy is the fund’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund. Over the past five years, this fund has gained a modest 23% which is substantially lower than the flagship S&P index’s 93.5%. Zooming into its 2024 performance, this fund has gained 20.5% while the index is up by 28.3%. Wood’s ETF’s performance can also be divided into pre and post-election gains. Before the election, it was down 7.6% year-to-date after having bled 13% during H1 2024. As H1 ended, Wood acknowledged the troubling time her firm was facing in an investor letter. She admitted “fully that the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but went on to add that her firm’s “conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.” According to Wood, Ark had to remain persistent back then since exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years.” The mean reversion she is referring to is the differential in the performance between the Russel Value and Growth stock indexes in the infamous dot-com bubble. Wood pointed out that “At its worst in 2000, the Russell Value Index underperformed the Russell Growth Index by more ~3,500 basis points on a year-over-year basis but, within roughly one year, the relative performance flipped and reached a positive ~4,800 basis points, more than an 80-percentage point swing, as shown below.” She believes that Ark’s strategy to diversify away from the Magnificent 6 (Magnificent 7 ex Tesla) through “increased exposure to multiomics stocks that have been hit hardest by “higher for longer” interest rates” led to disappointing performance. The potential upside from this diversification was evident in 2023 as the flagship fund “appreciated 68% as the bull market started to broaden out based on just the “whiff” of lower interest rates, despite its diversification away from the Magnificent Six and toward what we believe are more disruptive names,” according to Wood. To wit, while the flagship fund was down 7.6% YTD before the election after the ballots were cast and counted, it has gained 26% to bring its YTD performance to 20.46%. The benchmark S&P index, on the other hand, is up by 28.3%. For our list of the worst Ark stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the 110 largest holdings in Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 SEC filings by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the highest percentage. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Short Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 16.07% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 30 Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 Stake: $251 million Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is another genomic stock. The firm is developing treatments for diseases such as angioedema, lung ailments, hemophilia, and others. Since Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) does not sell any drugs in the market, under-development treatments are crucial to the firm’s hypothesis. Two of its leading drug candidates are NTLA-2002 and NTLA-2001. These drugs target angioedema and cardiomyopathy, respectively. They are currently in Phase 2 trials and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is enrolling patients for NTLA-2002’s Phase 3 trials. The firm’s shares are down 52% year-to-date, but the two drugs will enter Phase 3 trials soon to further create certainty around Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s portfolio. Additionally, the firm also has other drugs such as NTLA-3001 in its portfolio which creates additional room to get a drug to the market. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s management commented on its under-development drugs during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “In October, at The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting, we presented unprecedented positive results from our Phase II study of NTLA-2002 for the treatment of Hereditary Angioedema. These results showed that a simple one-time infusion of NTLA-2002 offers patients the potential for a functional cure. For people living with HAE, current treatment options are limited to chronically administered prophylactic therapies to prevent or manage attacks, and the use of on-demand therapy to control breakthrough attacks. Overall, NTLA ranks 6th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NTLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NTLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-inc-aapl-among-155557646.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $1.13 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), renowned for its iconic iPhone, Mac computers, and iPads, also derives significant revenue from its services segment, which includes Apple Pay, the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. On October 31, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a record fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year, fueled by strong demand for the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. The company is also gearing up for the release of its 18.2 software update, which will introduce a range of AI-powered features and is expected to roll out to users soon. Additionally, the tech giant is expanding its services into new markets, with the highly anticipated launch of Apple Intelligence in China marking a significant step in its global growth strategy. UBS analysts have adopted a cautiously optimistic stance on Apple’s iPhone 16, citing mixed demand signals and lukewarm interest in AI-related features, particularly outside of China. A UBS Evidence Lab survey revealed varying consumer sentiment across regions. In the U.S., purchase intent remained steady at 24%, while in China, it dipped to 17%, a 200-basis-point decline from 2023. However, Europe showed positive trends, with purchase intent rising in the U.K. by 200 basis points to 19% and in Germany by 300 basis points to 14%. Despite the tempered demand and skepticism toward AI features, UBS raised its global smartphone sell-in estimates to 1.21 billion units for 2024 and 1.24 billion units for 2025, indicating modest growth. On December 2, UBS maintained a $236 price target and a Neutral rating for AAPL shares, valuing the stock at 32 times its projected 2026 earnings per share of $7.49. In its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.” Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) The Best Plastics Stock To Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period.

Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. To compile our list of the 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now, we looked for the largest plastics companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best plastics stocks. From an initial pool of more than 20 plastics stocks, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds.

Neil Doak previously served as an assistant coach with Georgia. Former Ulster coach Neil Doak has been appointed as head coach of the Ireland U-20s for the 2025 Six Nations. The experienced former scrum-half was part of the ticket under Willie Faloon for this year’s World Cup in South Africa and now steps up to the top job. Doak will be assisted by former Connacht and Munster out-half Ian Keatley, ex-Connacht second row Andrew Browne and Blackrock College scrum guru Seamus Toomey who has been linked with a set-piece role with the IRFU. Ireland open their campaign against England in Cork and will warm up with a game against Italy on Friday week in St Mary’s RFC and against a Leinster Development XV on January 4. “It is a huge honour to take on the role of Ireland Men’s U-20s head coach, and a challenge I am massively excited about,” he said. "We have had a number of camps in the High Performance Centre and the application, hard work and commitment of the players has been really impressive. “We have a lot of work to get through in preparation for the U20 Six Nations, but the group are focused on building positively day-by-day and the upcoming matches against Italy and the Leinster Development XV over the Christmas and New Year period present us with an invaluable opportunity to build that cohesion and momentum. “We look forward to the challenges ahead, starting off with the visit of England to Virgin Media Park, where the Ireland U20s have received incredible support from the people of Cork in recent years, and we are determined to continue our excellent home record there and produce a performance we can be proud of.” Doak played cricket for Ireland at the same time as enjoying a career as a scrum-half for Ulster, before becoming a noted attack coach with his home province where he served as interim head coach while Les Kiss was still with Ireland, while he worked for Worcester Warriors between 2018 and 2020. He was part of Kiss’s coaching ticket for Ireland’s 2013 summer tour of the United States and Canada and has also worked at international level with Emerging Ireland in 2014 and Georgia in 2020 when he worked alongside IRFU performance director David Humphreys. In recent years, he’s been working in Ulster’s academy.

Title: Microsoft shareholders say NO to Bitcoin amid volatility concerns
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/microsoft-shareholders-say-no-to-bitcoin-amid-volatility-concerns/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T14:00:59Z
Full Content:
Could Bitcoin’s volatility outweigh its potential as a hedge against inflation? Microsoft shareholders have rejected a proposal to invest in Bitcoin [BTC], despite predictions of significant market growth. The proposal was led by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who called for Microsoft to diversify its portfolio by allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin. Saylor highlighted BTC’s position as the seventh-largest global asset, with its market capitalization expected to surpass $2 trillion shortly and potentially reach over $200 trillion by 2045. However, concerns over volatility led to the board’s decision, supported by major institutional investors like Vanguard and BlackRock. Instead, Microsoft is focusing on AI innovation and is cautious about cryptocurrency investments, underscoring a strategic shift away from digital assets in favor of cutting-edge technological advancements. Remarking on the same, Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO said in a proxy statement, “AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, and we believe it will fundamentally bend the productivity curve for every individual, organization, and industry sector to help us address some of our most pressing global challenges.” Nadella added, “We know Microsoft will only succeed if the world is fundamentally succeeding. We are focused on ensuring the world benefits from the broad technological shift to AI, while mitigating its risks.” The proposal, suggested by the National Center for Public Policy Research, recommended allocating 1% of Microsoft’s assets, approximately $784 million, to BTC as a hedge against inflation. Despite the proposal’s innovative approach, concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and potential risks to financial stability led to the board’s decision. Institutional investors like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, who collectively own about 70% of Microsoft shares, supported the board’s position, balancing a cautious view with their broader crypto interests. This highlights that Microsoft’s focus remains on stability, with a preference for predictability over risk. BTC’s volatility, substantial market fluctuations, and the risk of significant losses—such as its 70% decline in 2022—may have influenced Microsoft’s decision to reject the proposal. Additionally, the strategic use of cash flows to support operations and future investments is critical, and liquidating Bitcoin during market downturns could lead to losses. Furthermore, ongoing regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies adds an extra layer of complexity. As a result, Microsoft remains focused on low-risk assets like treasury bonds to maintain long-term stability and sustainable growth. As expected, Microsoft’s decision to reject BTC investment faced significant criticism and sarcasm from the crypto community, as highlighted by Bitcoin Archive in its recent X post. Source: Bitcoin Archive/X Saylor too jumped in and said, “In 5 years, they’ll understand. Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve.#BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” Despite this, several supporters came to Microsoft’s defense, emphasizing the company’s focus on long-term stability and strategic caution.

Title: Why Is Tesla (TSLA) the Best Self-Driving Technology Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-best-self-121627093.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. For an alternative list that focuses on the best autonomous driving car companies, please visit 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading player in the autonomous driving industry and one of the hottest firms in the sector. Its FSD assisted driving platform is among the industry leaders in America, and FSD’s success is also baked into the firm’s hypothesis. Through FSD and its Cybercabs, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to unlock new markets and diversify away from being an EV manufacturer. Consequently, the firm has to deliver on these fronts or see trouble with the share price as was evident in October after the stock fell by 9% after Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Cybercab event failed to impress investors with the specifics. However, the stock is up by a whopping 52% since the November election due to CEO Elon Musk’s proximity with President-elect Donald Trump and the market’s belief that this can generate positive catalysts for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The firm also benefits from having 1.3 billion miles of data to train autonomous systems and computing resources to crunch its algorithms. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period.” Overall, TSLA ranks 3rd on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is First Citizens BancShares (FCNCA) the Best Bank Stock to Invest in for the Long Term?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Bank Stocks To Invest In For the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) stands against other best bank stocks to invest in for the long term. Following the 2024 US presidential election, the banking industry has generated quite a lot of returns on the stock market. Bank stocks are dependent on interest rates, the lending environment, and the costs they incur. While higher rates mean that banks can increase their spread and boost interest earnings, if the rates remain high for too long, then the demand for capital dries up in the industry which affects the amount of money they can lend. Additionally, higher rates also mean that for some banks, particularly those geared towards consumers, interest expenses also jump since they have to pay out hefty amounts to account holders. The high interest costs experienced by these banks don’t mean that those focused on investment banking are spared the ire of high rates. Investment banks suffer from reduced market activity during periods of high interest rates since most investors prefer the comfort of deposit accounts and other vehicles to enjoy risk-free interest income. These principles have been evident on the balance sheets of some of the biggest banks in America during the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hiking cycle. As an example, consider the H1 2024 results of America’s second-largest bank by asset size. For the six months ending in June 2023, the bank earned $61 billion in interest income. This marked a strong 118% annual growth as the bank basked in the two-decade-high interest rate era in the United States. At the same time, however, the firm’s interest expenses sat at $32.4 billion to mark an even greater 731% annual jump. As a result, while pre-expense interest income grew by triple-digit percentages, after accounting for interest expense, the net interest income marked a 19% growth and was $28.6 billion. Similarly, higher rates also mean that banks focused on investment markets end up struggling. This has been the case for America’s fifth-largest bank by asset size. While Wall Street in 2023 and 2024 has seen broader indexes driven by investors’ AI euphoria, in 2022, the markets faced one of their worst years in recent history. Back then, the Federal Reserve unleashed back-to-back 75 basis point interest rate hikes, and most stocks that were not geared to withstand the new economic conditions ushered by the high rates stumbled. From the start of 2022 to the market’s bottom in October, the flagship S&P index had lost 24.8% while the broader NASDAQ’s technology focus meant that it lost a heftier 34%. Naturally, the fifth largest bank in America which derived 61% of its noninterest revenue from market-making and investment banking operations as of H1 2024 didn’t thrive in this environment. During H1 2022, its investment banking income dropped by 44% to $3.9 billion since it was accompanied by an even sharper drop of 49% for the second quarter. For the full year, the bank recorded a 95% drop in its 2021 ‘Other principal transaction’ revenue of $11.6 billion. This line item included revenue from its “equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in Asset & Wealth Management), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our three segments).” During the Q4 2022 earnings call, management commented on the tough year. CEO David Solomon shared how while his firm was eager to cut costs, it had to ensure that it kept up with competitors in retaining talent. The bank’s stock fell by 6% in early trading following the earnings as investors were spooked by the fact that operating expenses jumped by 11% at a time when revenue fell by 16% and profit dropped by a painful 66%. Back then, Solomon also shared how high rates and a tight economy had made things difficult for his firm: “Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter. While the incoming Trump administration’s perceived business friendliness and its effects on the economy are one reason the S&P’s bank stock index jumped by 12% after the elections, another reason is regulations. Investors believe that the incoming administration will not be as strict with the big banks. Heading into the elections, regulations were at the forefront of the industry’s concerns as we discussed in our coverage of 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Now, banks are hoping that Basel III Endgame, fair lending rules, heads of regulatory bodies, and private lending are some areas that the new administration might provide them some relief with. To make our list of the best bank stocks to buy for the long term, we first ranked all US-traded bank stocks by their market capitalization. Out of these, the 40 most valuable stocks in terms of market capitalization were re-ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A financial advisor and their client discussing the merits of wealth management services. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 46 First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) is a regional bank based in North Carolina. As was the case with the broader banking sector, its shares soared by 18% after the November election. The stock is up 53% year-to-date as it enjoys tailwinds from First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA)’s prudent moves during the 2023 mini-crisis in the banking industry. The firm used this opportunity to buy Silicon Valley Bank and add a large set of customers to its portfolio. However, the share price growth means that First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) is trading at 42% over its book-value-per-share, which creates questions about whether the stock can appreciate further or if future growth is already priced into the shares. The bank’s decision to buy SVB’s assets also means that in a low interest rate era that stimulates venture capital activity, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) can see greater tailwinds from SVB’s presence in the technology industry. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA)’s management shared details about what might happen in the venture capital market as rates come down: “So recognizing we’re not providing preliminary guidance on ‘25 at this point, there continues to be a substantial amount of dry powder, capital that’s been committed to venture capital, general partners that has yet to be invested. I think the stat for the third quarter is something like $328 billion or something like that. So a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to be invested. We’ve just seen the first 50 basis point rate cut with the expectation of potentially more. And that we believe that I think Craig said in his opening remarks, we hope we’ll begin to unstick this market, right? That things will continue to thaw and given that we’re now nine, 10 quarters in to what has been a very significant downturn in the innovation economy space. And so while I can’t predict the future and nobody knows exactly when that investment activity will pick back up, I think again, we remain well positioned for that inevitability when it occurs.” Overall, FCNCA ranks 8th on our list of best bank stocks to invest in for the long term. While we acknowledge the potential of FCNCA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FCNCA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock's private markets push may not be over after 2024 buyout spree

By David French, Andres Gonzalez and Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dealmaking splurge by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in 2024 may continue as the world's largest asset manager is expected to opportunistically look to further expand in private credit, real estate, infrastructure or possibly private equity. New York-based BlackRock announced last week plans to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion in a deal that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said will allow the companies to offer an integration of private and public market investment products. It was BlackRock's third major acquisition this year. Looking ahead, BlackRock could bolster its presence in private markets through further acquisitions, financial sources and analysts said. Targets could include an expansion in private credit or bulking up in private equity, positioning BlackRock to better compete with larger players in alternative investments. "They look at everything," said Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies who covers BlackRock. "They are canvassing the market for appropriate partners and asset classes that they are relevant in." BlackRock spent roughly $28 billion in 2024 to strengthen its private market offerings, a strategic move that Fink views as key to positioning the firm as a conduit for private capital into global infrastructure projects at a time of tightening government budgets and rising public debt. Private credit, which involves non-bank institutions providing loans to companies, has experienced significant growth in recent years due to stricter regulations that have increased the cost for traditional banks to fund higher-risk loans. In October, BlackRock finalized its $12.5 billion acquisition of investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners and anticipates completing a $3.2 billion purchase of private markets data provider Preqin by year-end. The HPS deal will create a private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets. Rival alternative asset manager Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) had approximately $313.6 billion in private credit assets under management as of Sept. 30. Blackstone (NYSE:BX)'s overall credit business is about $432 billion, the bulk of it in private credit, the firm says. BlackRock may continue expanding in infrastructure and private credit, said a source involved in the HPS deal, potentially targeting smaller, complementary acquisitions to enhance its offerings. "BlackRock has made a very loud statement that they want to be much bigger in private credit and in infrastructure within private markets," said Alexander Blostein, a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs who covers BlackRock. A further push into private assets could also include buying an asset to give BlackRock exposure to real estate - albeit once the commercial market has stabilized, said one senior investment banker. BlackRock's alternative assets under management — including private debt and equity — totaled approximately $320 billion as of the end of September, less than 3% of its $11.5 trillion in assets. BlackRock's alternative assets are dwarfed by its holdings in low-fee products like index funds and ETFs. Considering BlackRock's size, recent acquisitions seem to hold greater strategic importance than asset management, suggesting additional ventures into private markets are possible, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. "We've always thought of making organic and inorganic investments in our business," BlackRock's chief financial officer, Martin Small, said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in October. "Inorganic is a tool that we have in order to optimize organic growth, but we don't need M&A to meet our organic growth targets," he said then. BlackRock declined to comment for this story. PRIVATE EQUITY Private equity could be another avenue for expansion, said a source familiar with the matter and the senior investment banker. BlackRock has had informal conversations with private equity firms in the past, but none have progressed beyond preliminary stages, the banker said. BlackRock's acquisitions have been relatively "opportunistic" this year, said the same banker, suggesting BlackRock could soon be chasing new targets if the circumstances are advantageous. Private equity, however, may be less of an immediate focus given that the industry has struggled in recent years. "It's just a much tougher part of the business," said Greggory Warren, a strategist at Morningstar. Asked about a potential expansion in private equity, BlackRock’s chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said on Tuesday that the firm already has private equity capabilities. “For the time being, when we look at where the puck is going and we look at where clients are increasingly focused and find allocations, we prioritize both infrastructure, that's debt and equity, as well as private credit,” he said on a panel at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York. BlackRock's private equity teams manage $42 billion in capital commitments, trailing industry heavyweights such as Blackstone, which oversees $345 billion in private equity assets, and KKR, with $190 billion as of the end of September. "BlackRock doesn't have quite as much (private equity) as Blackstone and KKR, but I think they're more interested in backfilling other parts of the business," said Warren. Growing its secondaries business through an acquisition would be one way to advance its private equity exposure, with focus on one of its hottest sectors, said the senior investment banker. Total (EPA:TTEF) transaction volume in the market, where owners of stakes in private equity funds can sell them to other investors before the fund matures, is expected to hit a record-breaking $140 billion this year, according to BlackRock's own website. To be sure, the company may need to take a breather after this year's acquisition surge. "I imagine they'll digest some of the recent acquisitions, then the focus turns to upcoming fundraising, product creation, sales and distribution," said Benjamin Budish, an analyst at Barclays (LON:BARC). For Mac Sykes, portfolio manager for BlackRock investor Gabelli Funds, HPS was not BlackRock's last foray into acquisitions but the company is under no pressure to do more deals. "I see them as being opportunistic with a high bar. They are smart capital allocators," Sykes said.

Growing its secondaries business through an acquisition would be one way to advance its private equity exposure, with focus on one of its hottest sectors, said the senior investment banker. Total transaction volume in the market, where owners of stakes in private equity funds can sell them to other investors before the fund matures, is expected to hit a record-breaking $140 billion this year, according to BlackRock's own website. To be sure, the company may need to take a breather after this year's acquisition surge. "I imagine they'll digest some of the recent acquisitions, then the focus turns to upcoming fundraising, product creation, sales and distribution," said Benjamin Budish, an analyst at Barclays. For Mac Sykes, portfolio manager for BlackRock investor Gabelli Funds, HPS was not BlackRock's last foray into acquisitions but the company is under no pressure to do more deals. "I see them as being opportunistic with a high bar. They are smart capital allocators," Sykes said.

Title: What's New With BlackRock Stock?

Time Published: 2024-12-11T10:00:15Z

The BlackRock logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on December 10, ... [+] 2024. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BlackRock’s stock (NYSE: BLK) has gained roughly 32% year-to-date, as compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. In comparison, BlackRock’s peer State Street’s stock (NYSE: STT) is up 31% year-to-date. The performance of BlackRock stock over the last few years has been mixed. Returns for the stock were 29% in 2021, -20% in 2022, and 18% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s happening with BlackRock stock, and what lies ahead? Blackrock’s Q3 results were better than expected. While revenue stood at $5.2 billion, up 15% compared to last year, net income came in at $1.63 billion up 1.7% year-over-year. Growth was mainly driven by the positive impact of the markets, organic base fee growth, as well as higher performance fees. The company’s average assets under management increased by $2.4 trillion year-over-year to $11.5 trillion driven by $456 billion in net inflows as well as higher asset valuations. The company’s margins have also been picking up. Operating margins rose 350 basis points to 45.8%. Margins growth is being driven by a couple of factors. BlackRock is seeing a higher mix of higher-margin, higher-fee products including alternative investments which have higher fees. Moreover, flows toward exchange-traded funds have also been rising. While fees on these products are low, they are highly scalable, meaning that as AUMs grow, BlackRock’s incremental costs grow at a slower pace. BlackRock has also been steadily pushing into the private markets this year. In January, the company announced a deal to acquire Global Infrastructure Partners for about $12.5 billion, followed by a June announcement to buy Preqin, a leading private-markets data provider, for $3.2 billion. Earlier this month, it announced plans to acquire HPS Investment Partners, a private credit manager, in an all-stock deal valued at about $12 billion. This deal is expected to add approximately $850 million in base fees for 2025. The push into private markets is crucial for BlackRock, as the ETF space it dominates has become increasingly competitive with limited scope to increase fees. On the other hand, in the private assets space, the company can charge higher fees to clients, who are institutional investors and wealthy individuals. This move also helps BlackRock diversify and reduce its exposure to the volatility of public equity markets. Moreover, BlackRock’s existing clients including pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds are increasingly allocating capital to private markets to meet their long-term return expectations. We estimate BlackRock’s valuation at about $913 per share, slightly below the current market price. See our analysis of BlackRock’s valuation for a closer look at what’s driving the stock.

Title: AI can help India leapfrog and close the gap with large economies, says Blackrock’s Ben Powell

India can close the gap with large economies by harnessing AI-driven innovations, companies investing in AI infrastructure and productivity gains. Here are excerpts from an email interview with Powell, who is responsible for delivering value added market and investment insights across asset classes in the APAC region. Just like the rest of the world, India could experience rapid transformation due to artificial intelligence. We see three keyways in which AI could boost India’s economic development. First, and potentially most transformational, AI could innovate the way that economies innovate – possibly accelerating the pace of major scientific breakthroughs. That will likely be where the biggest productivity benefits could be seen. The speed at which India can harness these innovations will determine how quickly it can close the gap with large, developed economies. Second, for India to take full advantage of AI-driven opportunities, it will need to continue investing in AI infrastructure – including local data centers and energy – and in adoption of AI within companies. That will require further development of India’s capital markets to ensure a sufficient flow of credit. Third, India may have a double advantage in terms of its potential to grow economic output in coming years: not only because AI could deliver productivity gains but also because its labour force will continue to grow rapidly thanks to its young population. That’s in contrast to many developed economies and China, where AI may deliver productivity gains but among a workforce that is shrinking due to an aging population. AI will likely change the structure of economies, shifting how and where labour is deployed – and entirely new industries could be created that we can’t yet even imagine. This applies in India as elsewhere. India also offers strong long-term potential, in our view, even if near-term valuations appear elevated. India’s rapid growth rate, outstripping the emerging market average and surpassing China’s, underscores its economic ascent, albeit with some challenges ahead. We believe structural shifts underway in India map neatly onto the five mega forces we see shaping the world now and, in the future, – and provide a glimpse into sectoral and geographical opportunities. The dynamics at play in India are an example, in our view, of the impact of the mega forces we see as drivers of the new regime. Supercharged digitization that has revolutionized financial transactions, favourable demographics and India’s relative success in navigating a geopolitically fragmented world brighten the long-term outlook, we think. The rise of artificial intelligence is a prime example, reshaping economic trajectories. It’s no longer about short-term fluctuations in activity leading to expansion or recession. The ongoing outsized response of long-term assets to short-term news shows how unusual this environment is. As we head into 2025, some countries have new leaders with a mandate for political and economic change. That could see policymakers pursuing measures that add to volatility rather than stability. Our key investment themes to navigate markets in 2025 are as follows: First, harnessing capital markets to drive the region’s push into infrastructure and green technologies. Second, adopting more dynamic portfolio strategies to navigate economic divergences across countries with greater granularity. And third, remain pro-risk and stay nimble. Asia-Pacific is at the forefront of global transformation and is well positioned to navigate mega forces like the rise of AI, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts and the low-carbon transition. APAC’s potential aligns with our key investment themes for 2025. This includes markets such as Japan and China. We are overweight Japan equities as structural reforms are gaining traction supporting our positive view tactically and an above-benchmark allocation to Japanese equities in long-term asset allocations. And China where we see tactical opportunities even as broader, structural challenges persist.​ We are modestly overweight Chinese equities as stocks are at attractive valuations to DM shares, yet we stand ready to pivot if future stimulus announcements disappoint. Strategically, we see opportunities in EMs at the cross current of mega forces – like India and Saudi Arabia. As we write in the piece, we think AI has the potential to radically reshape economies and markets. In coming years, AI’s adoption will vary across sectors. Initially, it could be most helpful in industries like healthcare, financial services, and communication services, where it can reshape operations and drive growth. Recent research by OpenAI researchers suggests up to 80 per cent of workers may use AI for some tasks, and as with the information and communication technology (ICT) revolution, entirely new jobs are also likely to emerge. The long-run effects are much less predictable. Much like the industrial revolution shifted workers from agriculture to manufacturing, AI may transform today’s workforce. The ICT revolution similarly required widespread reskilling, and AI could follow suit, or be even more transformative – this is the mass production of intelligence itself. AI could transform scientific research, driving advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. AI could also be embodied in physical systems, including autonomous vehicles, drones, humanoids, and augmented reality. Some have raised questions around AI overinvestment and those questions are valid, but the payoff will likely come over the next decade – not in the next year or two. Comparisons with the dot com bubble fall short, in our view: The dot-com era was marked by declining earnings quality, deteriorating capital efficiency and inflated valuations. Many of these indicators had gotten considerably ahead of historical norms, signaling trouble. Today’s landscape tells a different story. Unlike the dot-com era, robust earnings support today’s mega-cap valuations. These are indeed challenges we should be aware of. But the models so far have been around for relatively little time and have shown remarkable improvement. Even working the technology that currently exists into processes can bring large benefits. Yet it will take time. Census Bureau surveys show only about 5 per cent of U.S. companies are currently using AI. Limits might mean that we always need to combine quantitative (AI-driven insights) and qualitative (expert human judgment) approaches. Different models/companies might try to design algorithms that explicitly account for and correct biases, such as through adversarial debiasing or reweighting techniques. Novel and promising solutions include utilizing synthetic data, or smaller models specifically trained and tested for reasoning in a specific area.

Title: BlackRock CFO Martin Small outlines the asset management giant's top 3 criteria for every acquisition

BlackRock is spending top dollar in its quest to dominate private-markets investing, recently agreeing to buy private-credit firm HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. It's been a busy year with the asset management giant also buying data powerhouse Preqin and private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for $3.2 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively, earlier this year. "Inorganic has always been a fundamental part of the BlackRock strategy," said Martin Small, the firm's chief financial officer, in an interview at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference on Tuesday. BlackRock isn't afraid to take big swings. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," CEO Larry Fink said in an analyst call about the GIP acquisition last week. BlackRock, which oversees $11.5 trillion, is not new to transforming itself through deals. In 2009, it pushed into passive investing when it bought Barclays' asset-management business. The acquistion gave it iShares and helped it become the public markets juggernaut it is today. The firm has important criteria for its major acquisitions. At the New York City event, Small laid out the top three factors and how HPS met them. Small, an 18-year BlackRock veteran who is also the global head of corporate strategy, named cultural fit as his top priority. "We have to acquire the kind of people that are aligned to a 'One BlackRock' culture and mission," he said, referring to the firm's ethos of working collaboratively. Small was part of many meetings with HPS's executive team to test the waters. He said the cofounders shared important values with Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito. "We all speak the same language," he said. "They're founders. Larry Fink and Rob Kapito are founders. We're client-centered firms. We believe in scale, we believe in global." The three cofounders of HPS — Scott Kanick, Mike Patterson, and Scot French — will lead a new private financing solutions unit at BlackRock and join the firm's global executive committee. BlackRock only makes acquisitions that are additive in more ways than one. "We've been in all the businesses that we've acquired, whether it's private credit or infrastructure or SMA or options or whatever. We've done technology and data in the last year," Small said. "It's not just about new capabilities. It's about new capabilities that make the ones you have better." Combining BlackRock's existing private credit business with that of HPS will produce a diversified business with a broader reach. "HPS has been very active in kind of the upper-middle market in terms of direct lending, but also the junior capital solutions," Small said. "Our team has historically been active more in the middle market, kind of $75 million EBITDA borrower base. So there's an enrichment." "I also think that'll strengthen origination, our ability to do more transactions, meet borrowers where they are," he added. "You've got to be a credible operator on a consolidated basis of these businesses," Small said of acquisition targets. Given BlackRock's prowess, it takes a sizable acquisition to move the needle. HPS's $148 billion in client assets fits the bill. "We'll now have a $220 billion preform a private credit business at BlackRock so we'll be very scaled in that regard," he said. Jump to

Title: Oil Prices Inch Up on Hopes of a U.S. Rate Cut and China Stimulus Measures

More Info Crude oil prices began trade with a gain today as traders turned their attention to U.S. monetary policy and China’s latest move to accelerate growth through stimulus measures. At the time of writing Brent crude was trading at $72.57 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate changing hands for $68.98 per barrel. The climb followed an announcement from Beijing that it would loosen its monetary policy to fuel economic growth although the lack of details on what this loosening would entail exactly limited oil’s gains. Additional support for oil prices came from Chinese import data, which showed that shipments of crude had inched up in November, for the first time in months. The increase was quite solid, too, at 14% from October to 11.81 million barrels daily. A U.S. oil inventory build as estimated by the American Petroleum Institute failed to reverse price gains, possibly because of its modest size of half a million barrels. At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to next week announce a fresh rate cut, which would be bullish for oil prices as reflected in the anticipatory gain today. Before the Fed makes its next rate decision, however, all eyes will be on the latest consumer price index reading, due out at 8:30 am ET today. Preliminary estimates see the November CPI reading at 2.7%, which would be a slight increase on October’s 2.6%. Core inflation for November is seen at 3.3% on an annual basis—for the fourth month in a row. These figures might make a new rate cut decision a bit problematic but media reports suggest that market players overwhelmingly expect that decision. “The Fed should be in a position to move forward on the December rate cut, but [the final] CPI report now becomes another significant milestone in the policy-adjustment calculus,” the chief executive of global fixed income at BlackRock, Rick Rieder, said.

Alphabet spikes after Google announces 'breakthrough' quantum chipShares of Google's parent company Alphabet rose 6% on Tuesday, a day after the company hailed its latest quantum computing chip as a "breakthrough." On Monday, Alphabet revealed its "Willow" chip, which performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years — that's 1 followed by 25 zeros — Google said. South Korea's ex-defense minister attempts suicide; police raid presidential officeThe fallout from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law continues amid reports of his office being raided and his former defense minister attempting suicide. Police reportedly searched the president's office on Wednesday as part of an investigation into the six-hour martial law declaration. Separately, ex-defense minister Kim Yong-hyun reportedly made an attempt on his own life in his eastern Seoul detention facility. China ramps up Wall Street meetings ahead of Trump inaugurationChinese Vice Premier He Lifeng has met with several U.S. finance executives in the last month as Beijing seeks to build relationships ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's planned tariffs on China. Some of the meetings are with top executives from Blackrock, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Dow notches fourth straight day of lossesU.S. markets fell on Tuesday as the S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25%, with both indexes notching back-to-back losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a fourth day, slipping 0.35%. Asian markets were mixed, with most major indexes staying range-bound. [PRO] Trump's proposed tariffs could cause unintended consequences: BernsteinTrump's proposed tariffs could have unintended consequences for certain brands, such as negative sentiment from Chinese consumers that could hurt U.S. companies' sales in that country, Bernstein found. What is quantum computing, and how does it work? In classical computing, information is stored in bits. Each bit is either a one or zero. Quantum computing uses quantum bits or qubits which can be zero, one or something in between.If you thought that sounded like something out of the Marvel multiverse, you are not alone. Every time a company comes up with a quantum computing breakthrough, such as Alphabet's Willow chip, the million-dollar question is: "What can it be used for?" Will we see faster laptops, faster smartphones, or can quantum computing be used for artificial intelligence applications? Will we be able to say "Open the pod bay doors please, HAL?" to a quantum computer? Proponents of quantum computing claim it will be able to solve problems that current computers can't. The theory is that quantum computers will be able to process much larger volumes of data, leading to potential breakthroughs in areas like medicine, science and finance. Shares of Alphabet surged 6% on Tuesday, but could this enthusiasm be unfounded? After all, if there are currently no real world uses for quantum computing, the solution cannot be put to solving problems, let alone commercialized. In short, quantum computing needs to have a purpose. It needs a "ChatGPT moment", as an analyst told CNBC, where people can utilize the technology such as how the chatbot allowed the world to tangibly experience artificial intelligence. HAL may just have to wait a while. Which as fans of Stanley Kubrick's epic "2001: A Space Odyssey" might know, isn't necessarily a bad thing. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.

Title: Is CommScope Holding Company (COMM) the Best NASDAQ Penny Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 11 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to look at where CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) stands against other best NASDAQ penny stocks to buy right now. The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world’s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year’s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed’s target. However, he emphasized that the path for monetary policy will be contingent upon incoming economic data. He underscored the uncertainty of the economic outlook, noting, “If we’ve learned anything over the past five years, it’s that the outlook remains highly uncertain.” READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market. Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world’s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year’s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed’s target.

In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market. Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Most Profitable Food Stocks To Invest In. Recent trends indicate a strong push towards sustainability within the plastics sector. Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.
