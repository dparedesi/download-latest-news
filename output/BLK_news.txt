Some 11,000 electricity customers remain without power on Saturday evening as a result of Storm Bert, ESB Networks has said. Those who remain disconnected are predominantly in areas worst hit by the storm including counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway. ESB Networks said while most customers currently without power will have their supply restored by Saturday night, it could not rule out further power outages as the storm moves slowly across the country. The worst of the weather so far appears to have struck the northwest, with more than 3,000 people in Carndonagh and Dungloe are among those not expected to have electricity restored until Saturday night. In Cork, Ardcahan Bridge remains impassable after heavy flooding caused by Storm Bert. #CorkTraffic Ardcahan Bridge remains closed, and impassable due to flooding. #StormBert pic.twitter.com/UWYSz703p0 In Galway where a landslide has closed Maam Road in Leenane, some 50mm of rain are reported to have fallen in the Maam Valley on Saturday. There are further reports this afternoon of roads closed in the in Belclare, Kilconly and near Athenry. At Cork Airport one flight from Birmingham has been diverted to Shannon and the authority has advised passengers due to travel this weekend to contact their airline directly for updates to their travel plans. The airport remains open. On the east coast Irish Ferries’ sailings between Rosslare and Pembroke have been cancelled. Irish Ferries said passengers can be accommodated on the Dublin-Holyhead route. John Fallon reports from Galway: Flood protection measures taken six years ago in the Spanish Arch area of Galway city appear to be working with Storm Bert not causing any overnight damage. Businesses in the area who suffered significant flooding a few years ago have installed their own flood prevention measures, while a large inflated boom provided by Galway City Council along the banks of the River Corrib as it meets the sea in the Claddagh Basin has also helped alleviate the threat. Niall McNeilus, a Labour Cllr who owns Claddagh and Celtic Jewellery at Quay Lane near the Spanish Arch, said businesses and residents in the area are always on their guard. “The measures taken by the individual owners of buildings in the area, coupled with the measures from the city council, certainly have alleviated the problem,” he said. “But you are always fearful. The storm last night wasn’t as severe as feared and thankfully didn’t do too much damage but there are a lot of roads impassable around the county and thousands of homes and businesses, particularly in Connemara, are without electricity.” Meanwhile, swimmers at Blackrock in Salthill were not deterred by the stormy weather with several dozens taking to the water on Saturday morning. “This is ground zero when it comes to flooding.” In Wexford, Aontú's Cllr Jim Codd is in Duncormick where cars are being pulled from the flooded area.

Overflow from the river Feale flooded local GAA pitches. Rebecca Mullen of The Flour House bakery in Riverstick, Co Cork, said that Storm Babet flooded the bakery last October, and the bakery had flooded again after Storm Bert. They had received grants from the Red Cross to help them through the last flood where a lot of damage was done. “Without those grants we really wouldn’t have a business today, it’s just really important that small businesses survive weather systems,” she told the PA news agency. “Saturday is one of our busiest days, we’ve already had to cancel a market because of the weather system, so now we’ve obviously had to shut the shop today, so we’ll be losing money there. “I’ve done deliveries of cakes today where I can to the people who have ordered, but now it’s the clean up, its the cost of getting the staff back in, extra hours, working out what is salvageable and what isn’t.” She said small businesses are already struggling because of rising costs such as the 13.5 per cent VAT rate and staff pay. “Every day counts. You can’t miss a day’s trade. I think that’s what’s going to really hurt us. Every single piece of coinage is required to get us through.” You can see the flooding in the video below: ⚠️Following extreme rainfall, floodwaters are rising at various locations throughout the county. Motorists are advised to avoid driving through floods. Council crews continue to assess and address issues.

The L5465-0 off the R579 is closed after the river Allow burst its banks. The L1121-55 is also flooded at Roskeen off the N72. Motorists are advised to avoid driving through floods. This video shows the Flour House Bakery and Café and the adjacent private dwelling in Riverstick, Co Cork, where the gullies flowing into the nearby Stick river were unable to take the volume of rain. Met Éireann has warned of further windy conditions on Saturday night with heavy rain in places and spot flooding continuing to track eastwards across the country. Lowest temperatures are expected to be between 5-9 degrees in fresh to strong and gusty south to southwest winds. The national forecaster reiterated it has a status yellow wind warning in place for Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow. The warning is valid up to 2am on Sunday. ESB Networks has reduced the number of homes and businesses without power due to Storm Bert to about 34,000, down from a high of 60,000 before early on Saturday morning. As of lunchtime on Saturday, the worst of the damage to the electricity network caused by Storm Bert remained in the northwest. Some 1,674 homes and businesses in the Dungloe area of Co Donegal remain connected with the ESB online fault map indicating power will be restored by 8pm. In Carndonagh, Co Donegal 1,483 customers were also expected to be reconnected by 8pm, as were 594 customers in Kilcar, Co Donegal. On Achill Island, some 248 customers have been told it may be 9.30pm before their power is restored. In Clifden, Co Galway, 1076 customers have been given a time of 5pm for restoration of service. In Macroom, Co Cork, 1,630 customers have been told their power will be restored by 1pm. In the Gurranebane area, near Valentia island in Co Kerry, some 768 electricity customers have been given a time of 2pm for the restoration of power. In Dublin where disruption was not as severe as many other counties, 100 customers at Stephenstown, near Skerries, will be waiting until 4pm for power to be restored. In Greystones, Co Wicklow, a further 32 customers have been told their supply will be restored by 2pm. ESB Networks has said the next update will take place close to 5pm. John Fallon is also reporting from Galway: Galway County Council crews are continuing to deal with extensive flooding in Clifden where a number of roads in the Connemara town are flooded. Meanwhile, some houses in the Inverin area of south Connemara whose electricity supply was disrupted during a snowstorm during the week remain without power. ESB crews are working to restore power to hundreds of houses and businesses in Galway. A number of roads throughout Co Galway remain flooded with motorists advised to take caution in areas such as Claregalway, Mountain North near Athenry, and Belclare and Sylaun near Tuam. Image of the landslide in Maam Galway this morning. pic.twitter.com/E2FiwIOkTz Andrew Hamilton reports from Galway: Four large mudslides have taken place on different roads surrounding the village of Leenane in north Galway overnight. The largest of these mudslides took place on the Leenane to Maam road and crews from both Galway County Council and Mayo County Council have been working to reopen the road this morning. The mudslides came as heavy rains from Storm Bert combined with melting snow on nearby mountains. “There were four mudslides in total, including one big one on the Leenane to Maam road. That completely blocked the road there,” said Fianna Fáil Cllr Gerry King. “There was one on the Leenane to Louisburgh road, another on the Letterfrack side of Leenane village and a fourth one, a minor enough one, on the Leenane to Maam road. “Thankfully there was nobody hurt in the mudslides and no major damage reported. Galway and Mayo councils are out working on the roads at the moment. Work is still ongoing but cars should be flowing again soon.” Further south, five houses were evacuated in the Clifden area as the Owenglen river burst its banks. The Galway fire service were on hand from 5am to pump water away from four houses in the Clifden Glen Estate and one house located on the low road in Clifden. It is understood that several centimetres of water entered one house in the Clifden Glen Estate but the efforts of the fire service have saved the other evacuated houses from damage. “This is the second time that this area has been hit. There was severe flooding here four years ago. Four houses in Clifden Glen were evacuated this morning and now the water is receding,” said Fianna Fáil Eileen Mannion. “I don’t know the extent of the damage yet but if water comes into your house it is very damaging.” #CorkTraffic Storm damage to a wall on the N72 outside of Ballyhooly.

High tide in Bantry passed without incident, according to Cork County Council, as crews will continue to be deployed across the county amid flooding in several areas. The R588 Copeen to Enniskeane road is closed due to flooding, while the R621 Longfield Bridge, Mallow, remains closed to traffic. There is also flooding on the R624 outside IFI Cobh. Council crews have been deployed and motorists are advised to avoid the area. Crews are also assessing fallen trees near overhead cables at Westview Cobh. Members of the public are advised to avoid this area. In Monaghan, the council is reporting that Castle Road is flooded, but Monaghan Shopping Centre is still operating as usual. ⚠️ #StormBert Update: Castle Road is flooded, cars should not enter the flood water. However, it is still business as usual in Monaghan Shopping Centre. pic.twitter.com/nFXhsihWKy Despite weather warnings, flooding and travel disruption, general election candidates will be on the campaign trail today, can anything stop them? Ronan McGreevy has all the latest in our election blog here. Irish Rail has said there is disruption on Dublin to Belfast services due to flooding between Newry and Lurgan. The company said there are also delays to early Westport and Sligo to Dublin services due to flooding on the tracks. Also on the travel front, Transport For Ireland said those seeking Local Link bus services should check with relevant transport operators before travelling as there may be delays or curtailments due to adverse weather conditions. Some services will be travelling at reduced speeds in the interests of safety. Bus Éireann has cancelled a number of services in the south of the country. For details, check the company website here. Barry Roche shares this photo of the bridge at the entrance to Belgooly in Co Cork where Storm Bert has caused flooding. Clare County Council has advised the N67 north of Lisdoonvarna, between Toovareragh Church and Killeany junction, is impassable due to flooding. The road is now closed. In Co Kerry, flooding has been reported in Tralee near the Rose Hotel. The N22 at Glenflesk is flooded as are roads at Fossa village, Glenbeigh, as well as the N71 near Kenmare and localised flooding in Killarney. Regional Road at Glenflesk is closed to traffic due to flooding. pic.twitter.com/1Z1Q8cK9t4 Barry Roche reports from Cork: A bakery owner and a homeowner in the centre of Riverstick village in South Cork were left counting the cost of Storm Bert as the gullies flowing into the nearby Stick river were unable to take the volume of rain and water began spouting up and flowing into both buildings. Units of Cork County Fire Service from nearby Kinsale and other Cork County Council staff responded and began pumping out water from both the Flour House Bakery and Café and the adjacent private dwelling. Local general election candidate Cllr Alan Coleman (Independent) said that the Office of Public Works (OPW) had provided some €40,000 for flood relief work on the river Stick but this was inadequate and he called on the agency to provide more funding to expedite the work. “The OPW has provided €40,000 but that will go nowhere near resolving the flooding problem in Riverstick – it’s not a major job – another €200,000 would be enough so I’m calling on the OPW to provide the money and expedite the work so as to avoid any repeat of today’s flooding.” Irish Times photographer Alan Betson shares this image of a blustery Dublin bay this Saturday morning. Back in Donegal, a video shared by business owner Mairéad Ó Hagan Anderson shows the level of flooding on Bridge Street in the Killybegs area. Thomas Pringle, a TD for the area, said his constituency office on Bridge Street along with several homes and businesses were flooded. “My thoughts are with everyone impacted,” Mr Pringle said. I cannot believe this is our town. The poor families and businesses on this street. Absolutely shocking. A tree was obstructing the flow of the river. pic.twitter.com/Xn8O6NEQlL While the status red warning for Cork has expired, Cork County Council says the effects of the rainfall event and strong winds may linger into the day. Council crews in the region are responding to the impacts of Storm Bert in West Cork and Cobh with reports of flooding and fallen trees.

Council crews are on the ground and anyone travelling is advised to do so with care. An update from Dublin Airport says flights are moving well but there have been a few delayed due to wind. “Staff are working hard to ensure minimal disruption for passengers,” a statement said. One incoming flight has been cancelled this morning due to weather conditions at the other airport. Barry Roche reports: Cork City Council has announced that the Corkmas Festive Market at Emmet Place will not open today due to Storm Bert while reports are also emerging of flooding on the R579 between Healy’s Bridge and Cloghroe on a stretch of road adjacent to the Shournagh river. John Fallon in Galway reports: Galway County Council advised motorists not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary as some roads are flooded in the region following a night of heavy rain. Storm Bert reached landfall last night but early morning reports in Galway suggest that damage has not been as bad as initially feared. ESB crews are working to restore power in some areas with Connemara the worst hit. There is flooding on the main N59 road from Galway on the approach to Clifden with local authority crews monitoring rising river levels. There is also localised flooding in An Spidéal and on the N83 approaching Claregalway. Back in north Cork, Barry Roche reports that more than 750 customers around Mallow lost power at about 7.30am but almost 550 of these have since had power restored. In east Cork, more than 2,000 homes in Youghal have been without electricity since approximately 8.30am. A new status yellow warning has been issued for Donegal from 8am on Sunday until 5am on Monday. Met Éireann also issued a new yellow warning for Clare, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo from 8am-7pm on Sunday. The forecaster reminded people to be careful of fallen trees and dangerous driving conditions. In Northern Ireland, police are urging motorists to take extra care on a number of roads in the Newtownards area because of the impact of poor weather conditions. It said that a fallen tree on the Belfast Road and on the Springvale Road, between Ballyhalbert and Ballywalter, has blocked both lanes. The PSNI said a shed roof has been blown on to the Ballyquinn Road, Dungiven, and is causing an obstruction, and there is a heavy build-up of traffic in the Dunhill Road area of Coleraine because of snow. – PA As Met Éireann forecasts the storm to remain the dominant feature of the weather over the weekend, ESB Networks said the numbers of premises without power had reached 60,000 and “further power outages can be expected”. The ESB said its teams were closely monitoring the storm’s impact on power supplies and “all available resources remain on alert”. Flooding is becoming a significant problem along the west coast this morning as damage brought by Storm Bert is assessed. The river Feale in Abbeyfeale, Co Limerick, has overflowed its banks. Emergency crews are responding.

In Clifden, Co Galway, surface water is becoming a hazard to motorists. Bus Éireann has cancelled services on Route 434 between Clifden and Westport. In Killybegs, Co Donegal, the town has been flooded with up to two feet of water reported in the streets. It is understood a fallen tree blocked a local river which diverted into the town. Emergency services are at the scene but significant damage to homes and property is expected.

The Galway city interagency emergency group is bracing for flooding in areas across the city. Local authority crews are monitoring the situation as high waves batter the coastline. Barry Roche in Cork reports: It appears that Cork city has escaped flooding with gardaí at Anglesea Street reporting that they had received no reports of any flooding from either the city centre, or its suburbs and satellites such as Glanmire and Carrigaline which have been hit badly in the past. Cork City Council had issued a statement earlier, saying that based on information from Met Éireann, there was no tidal flooding expected in Cork city and that Storm Bert was a pluvial or rainfall event that may lead to just localised spot flooding. Meanwhile, ESB Networks reported a number of outages in both Cork and Kerry due high winds bringing down trees on power lines. Carrigaline was among the worst affected, where almost 2,500 customers were without power for several hours with 152 still awaiting restoration this morning. Further west, some 1,300 customers in Rathmore, in Co Kerry, lost power around 6am but it is expected they will have power restored by midday. On the Iveragh Peninsula in South Kerry, some 2,500 customers around Cahersiveen and Waterville lost power at different stages. A photo here from Carlow Weather shows flooding in the Killybegs area of Donegal with emergency services at the scene. Another image from Killybegs showing the level of flooding with emergency services on site. As always it is the fire services that come to the rescue in floods. We really need to have a look at flood forecasting and preparation in Ireland. pic.twitter.com/YpLFnVIC8J Some 60,000 homes and businesses are without power this morning after Storm Bert brought heavy winds and rainfall overnight. Affected counties where large areas have lost power include Donegal Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Cork and Clare. In Donegal some 12,000 people are currently without electricity with the worst of the outages in exposed areas near Gaoth Dobhair and Buncrana. In Cahersiveen, Co Kerry, 6,813 premises are without power. About 7,000 households and businesses Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon have been left without power, with many additionally damaged by localised flooding ESB spokesperson Paul Hand said crews and contractors are responding where safe to do so. Mr Hand said the next update on numbers of homes and businesses affected would be available in about an hour. Estimated restoration times are being posted on www.PowerCheck.ie and www.ESBNetworks.ie as restoration work progresses. The authority said any damage to network should be reported by calling 1800 372 999. Rain and snow warnings cover Northern Ireland from midnight on Friday until 11am on Saturday. P&O Ferries said it had cancelled the 4am sailing between Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland’s south west on Saturday. Barry Roche in Cork reports: Business people and homeowners in Bantry in West Cork were this morning breathing a sigh of relief as the town escaped flooding, amid fears that heavy rainfall from Storm Bert might bring a repeat of last month’s inundation which saw over 40 houses and shops flooded. Met Eireann had issued a status red red rain warning for Cork and Galway with West Cork braced for the worst of the weather but this morning at 7am, gardai in Bantry were reporting that there was no major flooding anywhere in the town other than minor surface flooding on some roads. Gardai in Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen similarly reported that all three towns – each the beneficiary of significant investment by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in flood relief schemes in recent years – had again not suffered any flooding other than some surface water on roads. However, Cork Safety Alerts was reporting that there was flooding on the main Cork to Bantry road, R586 at Ballineen while there was also flooding on the Bantry Line, the R587 at Ardcahan north of Dunmanway and both roads were impassable. In East Cork where Midleton, like Bantry, is still awaiting a major OPW flood relief scheme and both homeowners and businesspeople are constantly on high alert for any Met Éireann rain warnings after Storm Babet caused millions of euros worth of damage in October 2023. On Saturday morning, gardaí in Midleton at 7.15am, had received no reports of any flooding in the town or in any of the surrounding villages such as Ladysbridge, Mogeely, Whitegate, Castlemartyr and Killeagh where dozens of properties were damaged in Storm Babet. As of 7am on Saturday morning it seemed that Cork county had escaped any major flooding with Mallow and Fermoy, thanks to OPW flood defence systems, avoiding a return to the inundation that was a perennial feature of both towns when the Blackwater burst its banks. There was some surface road flooding on low lying roads and around Mallow, and Cork County Council did post that some local roads off the main Mallow- Killarney road (the N72), were closed at Spa Glen, Ballylough Cross and Parkadallane. The council was forced to announce road closures at the Killavullen Road on the southern side of Mallow and at Longfields Bridge at Newberry west and upstream of the town due to rising water levels in the Blackwater. Closer to Cork city, the operators of the Cross Ferry from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe, which links Cobh while Passage West and Monkstown, announced the cancellation of sailings this morning due to high winds. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Talaght Stadium will host the Leinster Schools final The Leinster Schools Senior Cup final will move out of Dublin 4 and into Dublin 24 next March, with Tallaght Stadium set to host the marquee game for the first time. The RDS has hosted the final in since Lansdowne Road was redeveloped, but is out of action for the next year due to the redevelopment of the Anglesea Stand. The Aviva Stadium is unavailable, but is also considered to be too big for the size of the crowd expected. With the capacity of Energia Park in Donnybrook capped at 6,000, Leinster have been on the look out for an alternative venue and the home of Shamrock Rovers in Tallaght has emerged as the favourite. South Dublin County Council, which own the 10,716 capacity stadium and lets it to Rovers, are understood to be keen to host the game. Leinster have previously played pre-season matches at the venue, facing Ulster in 2014 and Gloucester in 2016, while Ireland ‘A’ played the Argentina Jaguares there in 2009. The draw for the competition will take place on December 9 and it is understood that it will be confirmed at that time, with Blackrock College defending the title they won at the RDS earlier this year.

Title: In Fiji, defense diplomacy and rain-soaked rugby

U.S. Defense Secretary reviews Fijian troops at Black Rock Camp, Fiji, on Nov. 22, 2024. U.S. Air Force / Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders Stay Connected Bradley Peniston BLACKROCK CAMP, Fiji—Fijian and U.S. officials cemented one defense agreement and opened talks on another—but first, there was roast pig and rugby in the rain. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived on this South Pacific island on Friday, the final stop on a nine-day journey that has taken him to Australia, the Philippines, and Laos. “The goal really here is to not just regularize, but to make more frequent our engagement” with Fiji and the Pacific island region, a senior defense official said ahead of Austin’s arrival. Austin’s visit here is the first by a U.S. defense secretary, but among a handful in recent years by various cabinet-level officials. Fiji is a leader in the region and one of three Pacific-island countries that maintains a standing professional military. It also controls a wide swath of waters and resources in its exclusive economic zone. “People call them ‘small island nations,’ but really should call them ‘large oceanic states,’” one U.S. official said. On Austin’s to-do list: wrap up 10 years of U.S. work on an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, or ACSA, a bilateral pact intended to smooth the way for joint U.S-Fijian military logistics. “From fuel to medical supplies to the use of maintenance facilities,” the senior defense official said. “When things happen, they happen fast. So to be able to say that we're able to do that, to offer that kind of logistical support, it's critical.” More than 120 countries have ACSA agreements with the United States. Some, such as Japan and South Korea, have copied the idea and signed their own ACSA-type deals with others. Such agreements do not commit signatories to military action in any way. Austin also came to launch talks on a status-of-forces agreement, another document that deepens a bilateral defense relationship. SOFAs lay out the legal status of U.S. troops and dependents in a foreign country, including civil and criminal jurisdiction. Basing arrangements, if any, are typically negotiated separately. “The SOFA will enable us to deploy and redeploy forces in support of Fiji and help us train with the Fijians on a very routine basis,” Austin said Saturday at a press conference at a nearby hotel and conference center. “I look for routine rotations, training rotations, where possible, to be conducted,” plus continued work with the Nevada National Guard. Austin said “there is no notion” of permanently basing U.S. troops in Fiji. “We did not have any discussions like that.” If SOFA negotiations are concluded as expected next year, Fiji will join several dozen nations that already have such agreements with the United States. Austin also said the U.S. would soon deliver several rigid-hull inflatable boats and a boat ramp to help Fiji patrol its waters, and announced plans for $4.9 million in foreign military financing, pending congressional approval. The senior defense official said Fiji would put the new funds toward small arms. “Again, building military capacity, right? Professionalization of the military. This will go really straight to what they're asking for, what the needs are,” they said. At the press conference, a local reporter asked Austin what to expect from the incoming administration of Donald Trump. “Fiji has always considered climate change a national-security threat,” the reporter said. “And we have President-elect Trump who considers climate change a hoax and who has also in the past pulled out of the Paris Accord.” What, he asked, should the Pacific expect in the way of U.S. leadership? “I can't tell you what the next administration will do in terms of policy adjustments or things of that nature,” Austin responded. “What I can tell you is that I'm absolutely proud of the work that we've done. We've advanced things in a number of areas and we've strengthened our relationship. “And I truly believe that the strength of those relationships will endure far beyond the transition of administrations. I think the United States enjoys the strongest network of allies and partners in the world. We have the largest network of allies and partners in the world. And our relationship with allies and partners around the globe has enabled us to sustain our efforts and to endure a number of challenges globally. And I'm confident that our strong relationship that we have now will continue to blossom.” Austin’s visit began with an elaborate welcoming ceremony at Blackrock Camp that included drums, dancing, and the presentation of a roast pig so large it took six grass-skirted Fijian troops to lay it before the visiting secretary. The rain-dampened proceedings continued with a 15-minute rugby game between the base’s team and a local village club. At the Saturday press conference, Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka recalled that Austin had played rugby at West Point. “If he’d come when he was younger, we’d have tried to recruit him for our rugby team,” Rabuka said. “You have some pretty good players,” Austin replied.

Commissioner Mark Uyeda defends the creation of regulatory sandboxes, as a CFTC committee advises usage of tokenized funds' shares as collateral for derivatives trading. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Following Donald Trump’s election as the new US President, regulators are pushing for crypto market reforms, from establishing regulatory sandboxes to allowing tokenized funds’ shares as collateral in traditional derivatives trading. During an interview for Fox Business, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said President-elect Donald Trump is right about stopping the war on crypto in the US. He also commented on what could be done to make the country a leader in the global crypto market According to Uyeda: “First off, from a regulatory perspective, we can provide proper clarity. Some crypto is not even a security at all, but we need to make it clear whether or not you would fall within SEC jurisdiction or not.” If a token offering falls under the SEC’s jurisdiction, clear guidelines are necessary so crypto firms can decide the right course of action to comply with the regulator’s rules. Uyeda also defended the creation of “safe harbors,” which are regulatory sandboxes where crypto companies could experiment with different products, allowing “innovation to occur.” The SEC Commissioner also argued that regulators must work with Congress and other federal agencies to create a cohesive approach to crypto. Lastly, considering Gary Gensler will step down as the SEC Chair on Jan. 20, Uyeda was asked if he is interested in filling the role, and he answered that this is a decision for the President. Uyeda’s call for reform comes amid a wider regulatory shift toward crypto and blockchain technology in finance. The CFTC recently recommended using tokenized funds as collateral. Bloomberg News reported on Nov. 22 that the Global Markets Advisory Committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved using tokenized assets, such as money-market fund tokens launched by BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, as collateral for derivatives trading. The committee’s recommendation, which now awaits review by the CFTC, highlights the potential for distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance the efficiency and transparency of collateral management. The advisory panel’s recommendation provides a framework for registered firms to hold and transfer tokenized non-cash collateral using distributed-ledger technology. The framework ensures compliance with existing margin requirements set by the CFTC, other U.S. regulators, and derivatives clearing organizations. Although the recommendations are not binding, the CFTC frequently incorporates advisory input into its policymaking due to the committees’ specialized expertise. However, there is no specific timeline for when or whether the CFTC will adopt these recommendations into formal guidance or rulemaking.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market. Growth Investment Ratio: 112% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) is an upstream semiconductor company that provides the building blocks of chip design to firms such as NVIDIA and AMD. This provides it with a key role in the ongoing rush of artificial intelligence since these building blocks are indispensable for any chip design. However, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)’s shares are up by a modest 14.9% year to date primarily due to the firm’s exposure to the broader semiconductor industry and not just AI chips. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) has missed analyst guidance for several quarters this year, and this led to its shares being down 3.8% prior to the third quarter earnings. However, Q3 was a reversal in fortune, as the stock soared by 12.5% in its aftermath. This was on the back of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) raised its full-year profit per share forecast to $5.90 over the previous $5.87 on the back of AI-related tailwinds. Subsequently, any AI demand materializing or a recovery in the broader chip sector should benefit the firm. Artisan Partners mentioned Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Bottom contributors to performance for the quarter included semiconductor design and simulation company Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS). Cadence declined due to weaker-than-expected guidance, sensitivity to Cadence’s hardware product cycle in the near term, and uncertainty around China exposure.” Overall, CDNS ranks 15th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of CDNS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CDNS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: US spot Bitcoin ETFs hit $30 billion in combined net inflows since January launch

Time Published: 2024-11-22T16:09:44Z
Full Content:
US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took in $1 billion in daily total net inflows yesterday as Bitcoin inched closer to the $100k mark. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw the most inflows, attracting $608.41 million, according to SoSoValue data. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $300.95 million. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF brought in $68 million and Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB attracted $17.18 million. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only one with negative net flows, recording $7.8 million outflows. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs have earned a combined $30.35 billion since launching in January following approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Elevated trade among the spot Bitcoin ETFs followed as Bitcoin climbed to the $100k mark on November 22, continuing its bull run. The inflows also come after BlackRock launched its options contracts earlier this week. During trading on day one, BlackRock’s options brought in nearly $2 billion, helping to push Bitcoin to more than $94,000. Grayscale announced this week that it was also launching Bitcoin ETF options following BlackRock’s impressive debut and a surge in investor interest. As trade continues through spot Bitcoin ETFs, it’s becoming clear that these avenues are one of the main ways for investors to hold Bitcoin. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, US Bitcoin ETFs hit $100 billion in assets, adding on X: “They’re now 97% of [the] way to passing Satoshi as [the] biggest holder and 82% of [the] way to passing gold ETFs.” Speaking of "100" milestones, the US bitcoin ETFs hit $100b in assets (altho more like $104b given the price surge overnight) w/ YTD flows flirting with $30b (double our estimate). They're now 97% of way to passing Satoshi as biggest holder and 82% of way to passing gold ETFs. pic.twitter.com/Y3070yW7Jx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2024 Elsewhere, in the market, Ethereum is up by more than 7% over the past week at $3,285, Solana has seen a nearly 20% increase at $253, and XRP has risen close to 60% to $1.44 in the same time, according to CoinMarketCap.

Title: Deribit Exchange announces integration of Ethena’s USDe as margin collateral
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/deribit-exchange-announces-integration-of-ethenas-usde-as-margin-collateral/
Time Published: 2024-11-22T15:55:48Z
Full Content:
In a groundbreaking move for the cryptocurrency derivatives market, Deribit, one of the world’s largest crypto derivatives exchanges, has revealed plans to integrate Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, into its cross-collateral pool. This integration, set to launch in early January 2025, is contingent upon receiving regulatory approval. Ethena’s USDe, a synthetic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, offers unique decentralized backing through delta-hedging derivatives in perpetual and futures markets. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by physical reserves, USDe’s innovative model enhances decentralization while maintaining stability. The integration with Deribit promises to unlock new possibilities for traders. According to Guy Young, founder of Ethena Labs, this initiative will pave the way for “completely new structured product use cases” that were previously unattainable with conventional stablecoin collateral. Young emphasized the significance of this development, stating that Deribit’s dominant market share—over 85% in the cryptocurrency options space—positions the platform as a pivotal venue for USDe adoption. As part of the integration, users will be able to use USDe as margin collateral and earn rewards, adding to its utility within the trading ecosystem. This announcement marks another milestone for Ethena, as other major exchanges, including Bitget and Gate, have also begun incorporating USDe into their platforms. The integration has already impacted Ethena’s ecosystem, with its governance token, ENA, experiencing a notable price surge. After the announcement, ENA’s value rose by 13% to reach an intraday high of $0.63. Although the token has pulled back to around $0.5896, the token has gained approximately 62% over the past month, reflecting growing confidence in Ethena’s innovative financial products. Ethena Labs, founded in 2023, continues to expand its offerings, including its recently announced stablecoin project, UStb (USTB), developed in collaboration with BlackRock and Securitize. The partnership with Deribit underscores Ethena’s commitment to bridging traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. With Deribit’s backing and increasing market interest, USDe is poised to redefine margin trading dynamics, signalling a significant step forward for both crypto-native and traditional finance participants.

Title: Grindr Inc. (GRND): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grindr-inc-grnd-bull-case-155509680.html
Time Published: 2024-11-22T15:55:09Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Grindr Inc. (GRND) on Value Zoomer’s Substack by Myles Kuah. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRND. Grindr Inc. (GRND)'s share was trading at $14.93 as of Nov 21st. GRND’s trailing P/E was 134.66 according to Yahoo Finance. lazyllama/Shutterstock.com Grindr has emerged as a standout business within the dating app industry, distinguished by its unique market positioning and strong financial performance. Unlike traditional dating apps, Grindr operates as a gay hookup platform, allowing users to connect with others nearby without requiring a mutual match. This innovative design, paired with features like advanced filters, paid subscriptions, and ad-supported free use, creates a compelling user experience that drives engagement and monetization. Its dominance in the LGBTQ+ niche, supported by unmatched brand recognition and network effects, positions Grindr as the clear leader in its segment. Grindr benefits from an expanding target market as 11% of Gen Z men identify as LGBTQ+, compared to 5% of millennials and 3% of Gen X. This demographic also boasts higher disposable incomes due to fewer financial obligations, making it an attractive and profitable customer base. Furthermore, Grindr’s focus on casual connections, rather than relationships, ensures consistent user activity and enhances the value of its paid features. The platform’s ability to cater to the fluid dynamics of gay attraction gives it a competitive edge, particularly for users seeking specific preferences or experiences. From a financial perspective, Grindr is highly efficient, with revenue growing at 35% annually and operating margins of 20%. The company’s return on invested capital hovers near 40%, reflecting its asset-light business model. Recent refinancing efforts have reduced interest expenses, enabling Grindr to allocate more resources toward growth and debt reduction. Although the company carries $300 million in debt, its robust free cash flow generation positions it well to manage and reduce this liability. Valuation remains a critical factor, with Grindr trading at a P/E of nearly 60, factoring in its outstanding warrants. While this valuation underscores its growth potential, it leaves little room for error. Investors remain cautious about management, citing concerns over promotional behavior and the CEO’s involvement in a prior SPAC-backed company that ultimately filed for bankruptcy. Despite these risks, Grindr’s dominant market position, scalable business model, and expanding customer base present significant long-term opportunities. A more attractive entry point could unlock value for investors willing to capitalize on this high-quality business. Grindr Inc. (GRND) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 21 hedge fund portfolios held GRND at the end of the third quarter which was 27 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRND as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GRND but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The dividend yield on the S&P 500 is very low these days. Because of that, you won't generate much passive dividend income by investing in an S&P 500 index fund. While the S&P 500 doesn't pay much these days, plenty of other dividend stocks pay a lot more. Nvidia isn't the only amazing stock performer out there. Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors just scooped up 11 million shares of a semiconductor stock not named Nvidia. The Oracle of Omaha has concentrated Berkshire's investment portfolio in his best ideas. Rather than feeling surprised, you should take advantage of such scenarios to scoop up solid growth stocks on the cheap. Ideally, these businesses should be growing their revenue and profits and generating positive free cash flow. Most importantly, these growth stocks should possess catalysts that help them post sustainable growth in the years ahead. Warren Buffett continued to sell Apple during the third quarter, but that wasn't his most surprising move -- not by a long shot. Dalio is piling into artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired stock Palantir Technologies, and dumped shares of a media company with an impenetrable moat. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the most-watched companies on the planet right now, thanks to its dominance in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant holds an 80% share of the AI chip market, and this has translated into triple-digit revenue growth for its data center business quarter after quarter. This market powerhouse once again surpassed analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share, delivered record revenue, and maintained gross margin of more than 74%. Earnings move stocks in the stock market. Looking at annual growth rates and MarketSurge's earnings lines can help you spot leaders. PepsiCo has increased its dividend annually for over five decades, making it a Dividend King. The company's dividend yield is currently around 3.4%, which is near the highest levels seen over the past 40 years or so. In other words, it looks like a fallen angel, which means it is a good company facing temporary challenges. Sign in to access your portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 14 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. Merely days after Donald Trump won a tightly-contested election for the top office in the US, Elon Musk, one of his most prominent backers, received further good news as xAI, the AI startup he founded in 2023, raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. News publication The Wall Street Journal reported that Valor Equity Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz were part of the raise, while the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar also participated in the funding process. This set of investors had also backed the startup with $6 billion in funding earlier this year. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. xAI has developed Grok, one of the leading AI chatbots in the world. It rivals the performance of chatbots from tech powerhouses with far greater resources. The firm also controls Colossus, one of the most powerful supercomputers globally. The supercomputer will become fully operational by the end of this year and Musk plans on expanding the hardware at the center of this endeavor to 200,000 GPUs. Last year, the startup also released PromptIDE, an integrated development environment designed for prompt engineering and interpretability research.

On November 20, Loop Capital maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $175 price. In an investor note, the advisory noted that there has been increased noise throughout the Gen AI ecosystem of late, but analysis suggests that Nvidia’s anticipated demand trajectory remains intact. The note further detailed that GB200 NVL72 at material volume was really a July-September 2025 event, but it may not matter much as the amount of increased Hopper production may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out. Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Structure Therapeutics Inc. (GPCR): Among the NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks. Potomac Wealth Advisors president Mark Avallone joined CNBC's 'The Exchange' on November 16 to discuss where he sees investing opportunities following Trump's election. He believes investing in the tech sector makes the most sense given the implications of the 2024 election results for the financial markets. He noted that the election has shifted the underlying dynamics affecting businesses, particularly regarding regulation and taxation. The new administration has changed the previous climate of heightened regulation and discussions around increasing capital gains and corporate taxes. Avallone believes that the potential for reduced regulation and lower taxes on corporations could create a more favorable environment for business growth. He emphasized that corporate America’s ability to deliver earnings will be crucial, relying on continued efficiencies and advancements in technology. This perspective supports his thesis that investing in technology remains a sound strategy for investors. When discussing specific stocks, Avallone highlighted major tech companies from the MAG7 as particularly attractive. He expressed confidence that the current administration would foster a more supportive environment for these companies, allowing them to thrive. Avallone also touched on the defense sector, which has historically benefited from global conflicts. He pointed out that defense companies have shown resilience and believes that ongoing global tensions will sustain demand for defense stocks, providing a hedge against market volatility. However, Avallone expressed caution regarding the healthcare sector, which has been lagging due to heavy regulation and political scrutiny. He noted that despite an aging population driving demand for medical equipment, regulatory pressures have hindered growth in this area. Overall, his analysis underscores a cautious optimism about investing in technology and defense while highlighting potential challenges within healthcare as businesses navigate the post-election landscape. Methodology We sifted through Finviz to compile a list of 30 NASDAQ stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 12 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A scientist in a lab coat observing a beaker with colored liquid as it bubbles and hisses. Average Upside Potential as of November 21: 185.26% Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative oral treatments for chronic metabolic and pulmonary conditions with significant unmet medical needs. Its lead product candidate, GPCR-01, is an oral therapy aimed at treating obesity and related metabolic disorders. The company recently announced its third-quarter 2024 financial results and corporate updates. It reported a strong financial position as of September 30, with $915.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This substantial funding is projected to sustain operations and key clinical milestones, including all GSBR-1290 studies necessary for Phase 3 readiness, until at least 2027. It announced positive developments for GSBR-1290. This oral small molecule targets the GLP-1 receptor and holds promise as a treatment for obesity. The company initiated a comprehensive development program for GSBR-1290, which includes two Phase 2 clinical trials: ACCESS and ACCESS II. These studies aim to determine optimal dosing strategies and evaluate the drug's effectiveness in adults with obesity or overweight and weight-related health problems. The first patients have already been enrolled in the ACCESS trial, with the expectation of including higher dosage groups in ACCESS II by year-end. Topline data from both studies is anticipated in late 2025. While Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) has other programs targeting obesity and related conditions, the focus is clearly on GSBR-1290's progress. This suggests it's the company's most promising candidate at this stage. Overall, this progress reveals that it's well-positioned for success in the industry. Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter: “Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GPCR) is a biotechnology company dedicated to making oral small molecule medicines to target the obesity and diabetes market. Recent share weakness has been due to two large pharmaceutical acquisitions in the space: Roche’s purchase of Carmot and AstraZeneca’s in-licensing of Eccogene’s GLP-1 asset. These developments were followed by updates from Structure that implied it had a promising asset, but it might be inferior to Eli Lilly’s first-in-class product. Shares fell as analysts reduced the probability of success surrounding potential peak sales. We think it is too early to reach a final conclusion on the company’s oral small molecule GLP-1, as these data sets are limited in total sample size, and there are compelling arguments for both sides. Given how quickly this space changes and our smaller position sizing due to the aforementioned dynamics, we are monitoring our position and making decisions based on our evolving analysis. Overall GPCR ranks 2nd on our list of the NASDAQ stocks with biggest upside potential according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GPCR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Caelan Doris says Ireland will be fired up to take down Fiji on Saturday. Photo by Seb Daly/Sportsfile Ireland captain Caelan Doris admits the comments from the Fiji camp that Ireland are “vulnerable” adds needle to tomorrow’s Autumn Nations Series game at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm). Fiji have never beaten Ireland in their previous five meetings while Ireland will look to record their second win of this international window. Fiji scrum-half Frank Lomani described Andy Farrell’s team as being “so vulnerable that we as a team and as a group we can counter that”. Fiji come into this game after recording their first ever win on Welsh soil with a 24-19 win in Cardiff two weeksSa ago while they beat Spain 33-19 last Saturday. Doris agrees the “vulnerable” description add a bit more spice to tomorrow’s encounter. “Yeah I think so. I mean we definitely respect them, how they play. The two things you look at are their pace and their skillset, the way they throw the ball around, but also they’re a very powerful team,” Doris said after today’s Captains Run at the Aviva Stadium. “It’s going to be a very physical game. I remember the one a couple of years back for how physical it was. It’s going to be the same tomorrow and looking forward to the challenge of that. “I think they'll probably be confident based off a couple of their results and how they've gone against Wales and Spain last week.” Even though Ireland conceded 13 penalties for the second week in a row last week (as well as two yellow cards in their win over Argentina), Doris says belief is still high in the camp. "If it's off the discipline they're looking at, I'm not sure exactly, but there's a lot of belief within our camp still. We feel we have the right people showing us the way and there's excitement about what we can do. The discipline has obviously been talked about a lot and it's been an area that has been very good for us historically, so we're looking forward to getting back on track there tomorrow.” Doris’ Leinster team-mate Gus McCarthy will make his international debut at hooker while Ulster back-rower Cormac Izuchukwu starts at blindside flanker in his first cap. What’s the message to the new players? “Enjoy it is the big one that we always speak about. The two lads in particular getting their debuts this week, they're pretty calm and confident players and people anyway. They've come in pretty seamlessly,” Doris added. “You look at Gus in particular, who's only 21, and he's a had a pretty steep rise from captaining Blackrock a couple of years ago to 20s to Leinster to Emerging Ireland, so he's had a pretty seamless transition the whole way and he's settled in really well in the group, trained really well and he's got his well-deserved opportunity now. “And Izzy as well has showed his class, he's gone on a bit of a longer journey through the sevens and whatnot and then he's showed his class in Ulster over the last season or so. I feel they're definitely both ready and I'm looking forward to seeing how they go tomorrow.”

Title: Goldman Sachs: eBay Inc. (EBAY) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up view of a customers phone, using the mobile app to buy products. Growth Investment Ratio: 71% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a well-known e-commerce retailer that has been operating since the start of the dotcom era of the 1990s. However, unlike Amazon, the firm’s decision to focus primarily on third-party sellers and not bulk merchants has meant that it has been unable to grow to Amazon’s scale. Yet, like Amazon and other retailers, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) also depends on high volumes to drive margins and earn profit. The firm has undertaken a new strategy to attract high-spenders to its platform by offering them hard-to-find items and then retaining them by offering other products. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is also expanding its consumer-to-consumer business model globally to drive volumes in its marketplace. Subsequently, this strategy is now central to the firm’s hypothesis and should influence the share price. The strategy also tends to perform well in an economy where inflation is slowing. As a result, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) could see tailwinds in the future contingent on successful management execution. During the Q3 2024 earnings call eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s management shared details for its new strategy. Here is what they said: “One of the key building blocks underpinning our return to positive GMV growth has been our geo-specific investment, where we leverage our innovation playbook from focused categories to better serve customer needs at the local level. While many of these product experience changes benefit all sellers and buyers, we are particularly focused on consumer-to-consumer or C2C sellers for several reasons. C2C sellers bring some of the most unique inventory to eBay and are typically less price sensitive than B2C sellers. C2C sellers accelerate e-commerce as roughly 60% of their GMV comes from used and refurbished items compared to 40% for our marketplace overall. Overall, EBAY ranks 33rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of EBAY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EBAY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks. Potomac Wealth Advisors president Mark Avallone joined CNBC's 'The Exchange' on November 16 to discuss where he sees investing opportunities following Trump's election. He believes investing in the tech sector makes the most sense given the implications of the 2024 election results for the financial markets. He noted that the election has shifted the underlying dynamics affecting businesses, particularly regarding regulation and taxation. The new administration has changed the previous climate of heightened regulation and discussions around increasing capital gains and corporate taxes. Avallone believes that the potential for reduced regulation and lower taxes on corporations could create a more favorable environment for business growth. He emphasized that corporate America’s ability to deliver earnings will be crucial, relying on continued efficiencies and advancements in technology. This perspective supports his thesis that investing in technology remains a sound strategy for investors. When discussing specific stocks, Avallone highlighted major tech companies from the MAG7 as particularly attractive. He expressed confidence that the current administration would foster a more supportive environment for these companies, allowing them to thrive. Avallone also touched on the defense sector, which has historically benefited from global conflicts. He pointed out that defense companies have shown resilience and believes that ongoing global tensions will sustain demand for defense stocks, providing a hedge against market volatility. However, Avallone expressed caution regarding the healthcare sector, which has been lagging due to heavy regulation and political scrutiny. He noted that despite an aging population driving demand for medical equipment, regulatory pressures have hindered growth in this area. Overall, his analysis underscores a cautious optimism about investing in technology and defense while highlighting potential challenges within healthcare as businesses navigate the post-election landscape. Methodology We sifted through Finviz to compile a list of 30 NASDAQ stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 12 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: Citadel's Ken Griffin considers selling minority shares whilst handing out political advice to Trump

Happy Friday! If you're doing food shopping for Thanksgiving this weekend, you might notice prices feel better … sort of. The cost of Thanksgiving dinner has fallen for the second year in a row. But it's still 19% more expensive than it was in 2019, according to one survey of grocery store prices. In today's big story, billionaire Ken Griffin has some advice for President-elect Donald Trump, including a suggestion for his Treasury pick. What's on deck: But first, can I give you a tip? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of Wall Street's most powerful people offered advice to the president-elect. Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the $65 billion hedge fund Citadel, called for some restraint from Donald Trump regarding policies implemented around immigration and inflation, write Business Insider's Bradley Saacks and Michelle Abrego. While speaking Thursday at the Economic Club of New York, Griffin said he appreciates the importance of those issues to Americans but said aggressive tactics to address them could make things worse. Griffin is one of the biggest donors to the Republican Party, but declined to publicly endorse either presidential candidate this year. Moderation hasn't been the name of the game for Trump with some of his proposed policies. The president-elect promised mass deportations of immigrants in the US illegally and wide-ranging tariffs of at least 10-20% on all imported goods. Griffin said the US should remain a place for ambitious immigrants to find work and warned cutting taxes poses a risk for a government holding so much debt. At a conference just a few blocks away, Pimco CEO Manny Roman also raised the issue of taking a tough stance on immigration amid a tight labor market. Griffin's advice for Trump didn't stop at his policies. He also made a suggestion for the future president's all-important Treasury secretary pick: Apollo CEO Marc Rowan. "Please take the job," Griffin said of Rowan. Griffin also might be looking for some advice. He said he'd be open to selling a minority stake in his hedge fund to the right partner. While Citadel still operates as a private partnership, Griffin sold a stake worth more than $1 billion in sister company Citadel Securities in 2022 to VC firms Sequoia and Paradigm. The relationship has been a massive success, according to Griffin, with the two firms helping Citadel Securities with "real insights" into managing its rapid growth. Almost a quarter of all US equity market volume is handled by Citadel Securities. Hedge funds selling off stakes of their firm are having a bit of a moment these days. Millennium Management, another multistrategy giant in the hedge fund world, is reportedly in early talks to get an investment from BlackRock.

Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more In The Irish Times tomorrow, there is an interview with award-winning children’s author Martin Waddell, who next week will be inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Irish Book Awards. Reviews are Anthony Roche on Nicholas Grene’s Irish Theatre in the Twenty-First Century; Neil Hegarty on Ulster 1912-22: change, controversy and conflict, co-edited by Brian Walker and Alan Parkinson; Declan O’Driscoll on The City and Its Uncertain Walls by Haruki Murakami; Claire Hennessy on the best new YA fiction; Siobhán Long on Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin: A Life in Music; Donald Clarke on Box Office Poison by Tim Robey; and Adrian Frazier on Derek Mahon: A Retrospective, edited by Nicholas Grene and Tom Walker. This weekend’s Irish Times Eason offer is Think Twice by Harlan Coben, just €5.99, a €6 saving. Waterstones has announced Long Island by Colm Tóibín, the follow-up to Brooklyn, as its Irish Book of the Year. Tóibín is the current Laureate for Irish Fiction and the author of 10 previous novels, three of which were nominated for the Booker Prize, two collections of stories and many works of non-fiction. The author said: “I worked slowly and tentatively on ‘Long Island’. I followed my instinct but I was never sure. So it makes a big difference now that this novel ‘Long Island’ is Waterstone’s Irish Book of the Year. It cheers me up and makes me feel that maybe I did something right.” Lily Keohane, Waterstones Irish commercial manager, said: “We’ve been spoiled for choice after yet another outstanding year of Irish writing, with new novels by Sally Rooney, Kevin Barry and Booker longlisted Colin Barrett’s debut to name only a few. But the true standout of the year has to be Colm Tóibín’s masterpiece, Long Island. This deceptively quiet novel full of longing, reconnection, and the joy of love rediscovered is the work of a writer at the height of his considerable powers. For many this is a return to already beloved characters and for others it’s an opportunity to discover one of Ireland’s finest writers for the first time.” * Question 7 by Richard Flanagan has won the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction 2024. The winner was announced by chair of judges, Isabel Hilton, at a ceremony in London. Flanagan becomes the first author to win both the Booker Prize for Fiction and the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, an achievement that affirms him as one of the most significant and acclaimed writers in the English language. Beginning at a love hotel by Japan’s Inland Sea and ending by a river in Tasmania, Question 7 is about the choices we make about love and the chain reaction that follows. Exploring the value of life, Flanagan tackles far-ranging seemingly disparate personal and historical topics, from H.G. Wells’ affair with Rebecca West, to the atomic bomb and his own near-death experience, expertly documenting life’s chain reaction: from past to present to future. * Tyrone translator Ellen Corbett has made history as the first Irish person to win the Stephen Spender Prize for poetry translation. Corbett’s translation of Laoighseach Ní Choistealbha’s Irish-language poem, Scrúdú (Exam), took the top honour in the Open Category, a significant achievement marking the first Irish-language win since 2012. The prize, awarded by the Stephen Spender Trust, is the leading global prize for poetry translation, and for the second year, is now open to entrants worldwide. Judged by British-Bahraini poet Taher Adel, poet and academic Jennifer Wong, and poet Keith Jarrett, the prize offers entrants the opportunity to translate poetry from any language into English. This year, Corbett’s translation stood out among the 1,000 entries from more than 100 languages, with several of her translations making it to the final stages of the judging process. Reflecting on her win, Corbett shared, “It is a huge honour to have won first place for Laoighseach’s poem. I’m absolutely thrilled and hope this will inspire greater interest in Irish-language poetry, especially in emerging poets.” Corbett, a PhD researcher at Ulster University, has dedicated much of her academic work to modern Irish-language poetry and translation studies, and aims to encourage young translators across Ireland to consider creative translation as a career path. Ní Choistealbha, an Irish-language poet from Co Donegal now living and working in Galway, expressed delight in seeing her work in English for the first time. “Obviously it’s a massive privilege to have one’s work translated at all, it’s also very interesting to have your work translated back into your own native language. Irish is my second language and I primarily write through Irish, but English is my first language. It’s almost like a revelation. The poem has a second life that in some ways resonates even more with your own life.” Both poet and translator look forward to future collaboration, with more translations already in the pipeline. For Corbett, “the Stephen Spender Prize has made me realise that I could have a future as a literary translator alongside my research. It feels as though there are so many opportunities out there for me now, I can’t wait to see where they take me!” The winning translation can be read on the Stephen Spender Trust’s website ( First Prize – Open Category (2024) – Stephen Spender Trust ) and will be published in print in Modern Poetry in Translation magazine. * The 37th annual MS Readathon, running from November 1st to December 15th, encourages children and adults to dive into the joy of reading while raising vital funds for MS Ireland. Launched in 1988 by Roald Dahl, the event has grown into a much-loved initiative, supporting more than 10,000 people living with multiple sclerosis in Ireland. This year’s campaign highlights the benefits of reading, with an MS Ireland survey revealing that 75 per cent of parents noticed enhanced creativity and imagination in children who read regularly. Participants are invited to read as many books as possible, with fundraising made easier through personalised QR codes and online platforms. Funds raised help MS Ireland provide crucial services such as physiotherapy, peer support, and respite care. To join, visit msreadathon.ie. According to author Eoin Colfer: “Reading sparks curiosity and imagination, offering worlds that stay with us forever.” * The launch of (S)worn State(s) - a new poetry book by the inaugural winners of the Markievicz Award: Annemarie Ní Churreáin, Kimberly Campanello and Dimitra Xidous, will take place on December 16th at MOLI, Museum of Literature Dublin. Tickets here. This collaborative book is published by world-renowned letterpress The Salvage Press. (S)worn State(s) draws upon social history, myth, and visionary poetics to remember, challenge, and reimagine ‘worn’ narratives of women’s experiences in the context of shifting historical and cultural landscapes in Ireland in the Irish Decade of Centenaries and beyond. * The Limerick Writers’ Centre launches Head First, From a Height, the debut novel by Cork-based author Freyja Hellebust, winner of the 2024 Gerald Griffin Competition for First Original Adult Fiction, on Wednesday, November 27th at 7pm at Prim’s Bookshop in Kinsale, with writer Niamh Prior performing the official launch. “We are thrilled to recognise Freyja Hellebust’s exceptional talent,” says Dominic Taylor of the Limerick Writers’ Centre. “Her novel showcases the vibrant state of original fiction writing in Ireland today.” Hellebust’s literary journey began at age 14 when she won a short story competition at Listowel Writers’ Week. Her talent continued to flourish through her teenage years, garnering multiple accolades including recognition in the Trinity College Book of Kells competition. In 2023, she was awarded the UCC Eoin Murray Memorial Scholarship for creative writing. The Gerald Griffin Competition, named after the renowned Limerick writer (1803-1840), celebrates emerging talent in Irish literature. Griffin’s own masterpiece, The Collegians, achieved international recognition and inspired numerous adaptations across various media. * The Dublin Literary Award will celebrate 30 years in 2025. Dublin City Council this week announced the members of the judging panel, for this, the world’s largest prize for a single novel published in English. The international panel of judges features Gerbrand Bakker, Dutch author and winner of the Dublin Literary Award (formerly IMPAC Prize) in 2010; Martina Devlin, award-winning Irish author and newspaper columnist; Fiona Sze-Lorrain, writer, poet, translator, musician and editor based in Paris; Prof Leonard Cassuto, professor of American literature at Fordham University, freelance literary journalist, columnist, editor and author; and Nidhi Zak/Aria Eipe, poet and editor based in Dublin. The non-voting chairperson is Prof Chris Morash, the Seamus Heaney Professor of Irish Writing at Trinity College Dublin who has led the judging process since 2019. Uniquely, the award receives its nominations from public libraries around the world and recognises both writers and translators. In 2024, there were 70 books on the 2024 longlist nominated from 80 libraries in 35 countries. This judging panel will choose both the shortlist and ultimate winner of the award. The longlist will be announced on January 14th and the 30th winner of this internationally renowned award will be announced next May as part of International Literature Festival Dublin. * The Bridport Prize international writing competition has announced a new £500 Never Too Late Award to unlock the hidden talent of older writers. Writers in later life often struggle to be seen despite a wealth of experience, creativity and stories to tell. This award is for the highest placed writer in the competition aged 60+ across poetry, short story, novel or flash fiction. The deadline is May 31st, 2025. Championed by bestselling author Kit de Waal (64) and London Literary Agent, AM Heath (in business for over a century), this award aims to recognise success over 60 and a ‘never give up’ resilience that is the mainstay of writers. ‘What a privilege to be associated with this award!’ says Kit de Waal. ‘My first novel was published when I was 56, something I never imagined possible. There again, at 56 I was just getting my second wind (or possibly my third …) and even now at 64 I consider myself mid-career with a lot more to do and say. Thanks to The Bridport Prize and the Never Too Late Award, we can recognise the unique voice and hard work of older writers who are just getting started. Hoorah for us!’ Now in her mid 60s, Kit is a highly acclaimed writer of novel, memoir and TV drama. Her bestselling novel, My Name Is Leon is on the English literature GCSE school curriculum while her latest novel The Best Of Everything is published next April. * Rory Brennan, the former director of Poetry Ireland and a lecturer at DCU, died last Sunday in Blackrock Hospice. He is survived by his wife Fionnuala and daughters Orla and Fiona. Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

The huge inflows come after options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF kicked off on November 19, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of the listing of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs last month. Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted the largest inflows of any fund yesterday, drawing in just over $608 million on November 21, according to data from Farside Investors. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), meanwhile, attracted over $301 million of new funds, while Bitwise’s Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) fund attracted $68 million. Though historically extremely high, yesterday's ETF inflows are still quite a way off those recorded on November 8, amid the immediate run-up to the election of Donald Trump and widespread speculation regarding the impact of the pro-crypto U.S. government. Blackrock’s IBIT pulled in a total of $1.12 billion on November 7, beating out its prior October 30 record of $872 million, according to data from SoSoValue. Trump had promised to protect crypto mining interests, fire regulators like the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Gary Gensler (who subsequently announced he was stepping down), and even establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. The news of record inflows comes as Bitcoin ETFs are increasingly becoming one of the dominant ways in which Bitcoin is held. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted how U.S. bitcoin ETFs hit $100 billion in assets on November 22 in a tweet. Speaking of "100" milestones, the US bitcoin ETFs hit $100b in assets (altho more like $104b given the price surge overnight) w/ YTD flows flirting with $30b (double our estimate). They're now 97% of way to passing Satoshi as biggest holder and 82% of way to passing gold ETFs. pic.twitter.com/Y3070yW7Jx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2024 This means that Bitcoin EFTs now account for a larger proportion of the total Bitcoin held than Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, and represent about 82% of the total value of Gold ETFs. However, it seems Bitcoin ETFs’ rosy investor sentiment hasn't carried over to Ethereum ETFs. Per Farside Investors data, Ethereum ETFs have recorded outflows every day consecutively since November 14, hemorrhaging $7 million on November 21.

Title: Goldman Sachs: The Boeing Company (BA) Is A Top Growth Investor Stock

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Growth Investment Ratio: 292% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is another mega-American firm that has faced a lot of troubles in 2024. While Intel’s troubles are in the semiconductor industry and have not affected downstream players, the firm’s production woes in the aftermath of safety problems with its aircraft have disrupted the travel industry as well. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has faced off with striking unions and regulators, the cumulative effect of which has led to delayed aircraft deliveries. As a result, the road is long and hard for the firm to regain its lost stature; a fact that’s also evident in its 44.9% year-to-date share price drop. Production efficiencies and safety overhaul coupled with satisfied employees are driving The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s hypothesis and have the potential to affect its share price moving forward. In the meantime, multi-billion dollar orders such as a recent $2.6 billion Air Force contract for prototype aircraft should help the firm. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s management commented on its production during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “The quarter ended with approximately 60 737-8s built prior to 2023, the vast majority for customers in China and India, down 30 from last quarter. Additional progress on shutting down the shadow factory has been impacted by the work stoppage, which will now extend into next year. On the -7 and -10, inventory levels remained stable at approximately 35 airplanes and the certification time lines remain unchanged. On the 787 program, we delivered 14 airplanes in the quarter. And as previously noted, we continue to work through production recovery plans on heat exchangers and delivery delays associated with seat certifications. Overall, BA ranks 3rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meet Don Jr.’s New Boss

Full Content:
Hours after ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on a Monday last December, Omeed Malik hosted a party at the Core Club in midtown Manhattan. He suggested I come along. “Just look decent,” he texted me, after I asked about a dress code. It was a relatively small gathering. Skyline views. A few New York Post reporters were making the rounds, as were producers for Tucker Carlson, whose post–Fox News career Malik was funding. It was here that the financier wanted to tell me about his idea for a “parallel economy” — a kind of Brexit for conservatives from corporate America, which he saw tilting inexorably into wokeness. Malik’s answer to DEI, he told me, was his own acronym: EIG, or companies that prioritize entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth. “73 million people voted for Donald Trump, and the Brookings Institute quantifies that as 30 percent of American GDP,” he said — totaling roughly $7 trillion. “That’s the third-largest economy in the world. I’m happy to be the financier of the third-largest economy. I don’t need to go to Vietnam or India. I’m here.” As we were talking, though, I couldn’t stop looking at the orange horse-patterned scarf he wore around his dark suit. “Hermès,” he said. “And so is the tie. I guess that’s not necessarily a man-of-the-people look, but it looks good nonetheless.” (As for me, well, I tried.) Nearly a year has passed, and it looks like Malik’s pitch is meeting its moment. Donald Trump’s second election win comes amid a massive corporate retrenchment: the scaling back of DEI, the lionization of anti-woke crusaders like Vivek Ramaswamy and Robbie Starbuck, and the end of the CEO as culture warrior. Malik was already one of the most quietly influential forces dismantling so-called woke capitalism. And now he’s Donald Trump Jr.’s new boss, after the president-elect’s oldest son — a close friend — joined his venture-capital firm, 1789 Capital, as a partner. Woke capitalism is a messy term, but there’s no doubt that the last few years have been a strange time in corporate America. After the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Wall Street banks stepped into the void left by lawmakers and limited business for gun sellers and manufacturers. Larry Fink, the CEO of private-equity giant BlackRock, wrote a letter that same year saying that corporations should not just look out for their shareholders, but make “a positive contribution to society,” and has sold financial products geared toward lofty environmental, sustainability, and governance (or ESG) goals. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which challenged businesses to hire and promote women and minorities, proliferated. The marriage between capital and social justice was sometimes comically awkward. (See: the same jokes every June about weapons manufacturers rolling out their Pride logos on social media.) But to the conservative side of Wall Street, this wasn’t just harmless posturing; it was a means of cutting off financing from businesses. “We looked at a deal with an apparel company — a big portion of this company’s customers are hunters,” Christopher Buskirk, a 1789 co-founder and chief investment officer, told me. “A fund had a deal to buy this company, but broke the deal because, they said, the fact that some of their customers wore the apparel while hunting violated their ESG agreement.” Malik is quite possibly the poster boy for the post-cancellation conservative glow-up. Born in New Jersey to Iranian and Pakistani immigrants, he was, in his own telling, a “run-of-the-mill” Democrat until a few years ago. He wrote speeches for a Democratic congressman, Donald Payne Jr.; after law school, he went to work for Jon Corzine, the onetime Goldman Sachs partner and New Jersey governor, at commodities trading firm MF Global. (Soon after Malik joined, the company collapsed into bankruptcy.) Within a few years, Malik was running one of Bank of America’s most important businesses, its prime-services desk, a special brokerage service that caters to hedge funds. “He was the hotshot young Wall Street guy, and it was a business that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had had a lock on for 20 or 30 years,” one former client said. “He really put them on the map.” On Wall Street, his vibe was decidedly pre–Great Financial Crisis. “With Omeed, it was back to the future,” said Scott Bessent, founder of the hedge fund Key Group, who is currently in the running to be the next Treasury secretary. “His companies are a modern model, but with an old-fashioned ethos.” He wore mirrored aviators, flaunted nice clothes, partied with beautiful women. He would eventually land a walk-on role on the Showtime series Billions. If you’d come across him at, say, Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT conference for hedge-fund managers, you’d find a man who had no second thoughts about enjoying his success. Then, in 2018, he was fired. Allegations of “unwanted advances” toward a female banker were leaked to business reporters. Malik filed a defamation suit against Bank of America, denying that he had done anything wrong. He also filed a claim against the bank alleging that he was fired in retaliation after complaining that one of his bosses didn’t have the required securities licenses. (A markets watchdog later fined the bank over the issue.) Bank of America soon reportedly settled with him for eight figures, and he used some of that money to start his own investment bank, called Farvahar Partners. (He declined to comment on the settlement.) Other companies would follow: 1789 Capital, a venture-capital firm, would invest directly in companies. Colombier, a blank-check acquisition firm, would take them public through SPAC mergers. Soon he was again connecting companies with money from investors, this time in private, as well as public, markets — a sign that his reputation wasn’t really affected by the news. “He does his work, and he understands the role that he’s meant to play. And if he presents that he can do something, he does it. I haven’t seen him fail when he says he’s going to do something,” one person familiar with his business around this time told me. That night at the Core Club, Malik described to me how the pandemic had become a political breaking point for him. At the time, he was newly married and his wife was pregnant. Even though pregnant women were excluded from clinical COVID-vaccine trials, health officials still recommended they take the shots. He was against the prolonged lockdowns and vaccine mandates to re-enter public life. “That was when I said I’ve had it, and we moved to Florida,” he said. Political-donation records show his break from Democrats started earlier, though. During the first half of 2019, almost all of Malik’s donations went to Democrats, including $2,800 each to Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. By July, he had switched almost entirely to Republicans, including Donald Trump. By April 2020, he was contributing to Carlson’s conservative outlet the Daily Caller, and by August, he had invested in the site. It was around this time that Malik and Don Jr. first co-bylined an op-ed that was critical of China. Malik and Don Jr. have been described as very close by three people familiar with their friendship — often traveling and hanging out together. But Malik, a Mar-a-Lago member, has also been quietly making inroads with some of MAGA world’s most important figures not named Trump. He has backing from Rebekah Mercer, the Republican mega-donor, while Blake Masters, the Peter Thiel protégé who has lost two bids for Congress in Arizona, sits on the board of 1789. He has donated to, and frequently interviewed, Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democrat. Malik was also described by one Trump adviser as part of J.D. Vance’s inner circle. Malik was one of the biggest backers of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raising millions of dollars for his third-party election campaign. But he remained close to the Trump family, according to two people directly familiar with his relationships. “He was day one,” one said. “There’s a group who just kept going after January 6, and he was part of that.” (Malik’s Instagram account on that day shows a video from the Capitol riots with the caption”I don’t care what side someone is on — violence is unacceptable in every situation,” but doesn’t mention Trump.) Two people told me he was involved in getting Kennedy and Gabbard to endorse Trump, and helped them get administration appointments: Gabbard as the director of national intelligence, and Kennedy to lead Health and Human Services. But what good is a parallel economy when you’ve already won? 1789 has invested in companies like Substack, which has been a favorite of the conservative, non-elite media, as well as a pharmaceutical-delivery service that doesn’t seem obviously involved in any culture wars. Malik took the retail company Public Square, a kind of Amazon for conservatives, public last year through a SPAC, and he now sits on the board. Since its debut, however, the stock is down about 90 percent from its peak, and its last quarterly report showed it made $6.5 million in revenue — about what Amazon makes every ten minutes. (Malik holds a roughly 10 percent stake in the company and hasn’t sold any shares. He has been collecting a $60,000-a-month consulting fee from the company, two people familiar with the arrangement told me. One of them said that arrangement ended in November.) Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos has been trying to get in Trump’s good graces, and Amazon’s stock — the real thing, not the anti-woke version — is near all-time highs. With wokeness on the retreat, it’s not clear whether Malik’s old playbook will be as relevant as it once was. But with his fortune and his deep connections to the incoming presidential administration, he probably isn’t too bothered by that. “When you’re the loyal opposition, maybe it’s okay to have ‘anti-’ in front of your name,” Malik said during a November 17 CNBC interview. “But I think we were validated in our thesis a couple of weeks ago.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.

Title: Katriona O'Sullivan: So many children in poverty and Fine Gael's answer is a savings account?

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 22 Nov WHEN POLITICAL PARTIES release their election manifestos, there’s bound to be one or two elements that cause us to roll our eyes. But this week, there was one offering in particular that just stuck in my craw. At a time of increasing deprivation and child poverty, I found myself seriously questioning who is advising Simon Harris, and Fine Gael, in terms of their policy decisions. In their manifesto, admittedly amid some fine ideas, we also had the unveiling of the ‘Acorn’ project, which stopped me in my tracks. The Acorn project promises to deposit €1,000 into a bank account set up for every child born in the state. The account will be in the child’s name, and as a mark of their consideration for the poor unfortunate children from disadvantaged backgrounds, they will allocate an extra €500 to these children. So every child born in Ireland will get a bank account created for them and Fine Gael will deposit €1,000 to most kids, and €1,500 to the poor kids. According to Harris, the aim of this hair-brained scheme is to encourage parents to save for their children’s future. The Fine Gael Manifesto highlights that if a family were to deposit €2,000 annually into the account, the child would potentially have almost €53,000 by the time they turn 18. Harris himself said that Acorn “fosters a culture of saving and financial literacy, and it will help get every child off to the best start in life.” Let’s start with what is good about Acorn — the idea itself isn’t a bad one, wouldn’t we all like to be a bit better at saving, and teach our children the value of saving for the future? However, the idea that we need to be told, or taught, how to save for our children is slightly patronising. What underpins Acorn is the idea that Fine Gael needs to teach us how to be better parents, and how to be financially literate. Advertisement Firstly, this is totally unnecessary when it comes to the middle-income bracket. Most people I know in this position are already financially literate, they are already putting away money for their children’s future — even if it is only the child benefit — many are preparing themselves for college fees or the like. The manifesto comes from a party that prides itself on its financial prudence and on how it pulled us out of austerity, so shouldn’t it be the one to teach us about money? The Acorn promise is especially annoying for me because we are being taught financial literacy by a political party that some may argue isn’t as financially literate as it claims. For one, Fine Gael has overseen years of growing inequality, and hasn’t it been in charge of the biggest overspend on a national hospital in the history of the world? Are we to take financial guidance from a party that has, with its coalition partners, presided over an economy so heavily reliant on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) that it’s now exceptionally vulnerable to global shocks? One of the parties to oversee the most painful and pervasive housing crises in the history of modern Ireland? We have the lowest investment in education per person across the OECD — oh, and we spend 100s of thousands of euros on bike sheds when we have thousands of children on waiting lists for psychological assessments. It perturbs me a little to have this government saying they are going to teach me how to manage my money better, when they clearly have not been able to manage MY money better themselves. Imagine the scenario where a newborn child is born into homeless services or housing insecurity (which is happening right now), and his or her parents have no money to spare — no home, and no capacity to support their child. They may be living in a hotel room — probably buying takeaway food most nights because they have no cooking facilities. But Fine Gael will pop €1,500 into the child’s bank account to encourage the parents to think about the child’s future. A carrot to dangle in front of them, the promise of a bright future they can’t yet see. It is estimated that Acorn will cost the state about €78 million a year; would we not be better off spending that money on housing, health or helping children get the security they need to live a full and free life? I was homeless, I lived in the insecurity of homeless services when I was 16 — me and my child — and I still carry the indelible mark of homelessness with me. I never feel fully safe in my home. I always have a low-level worry that I may lose where I live. The 4,561 children currently living in homeless services in Ireland deserve better than token gestures. The 378 families living in hotels and hostels in Dublin for over two years deserve more. They need support now. Not in 18 years. My final problem with the Acorn project is that potentially it will increase inequality — rather than reduce it. An issue which was also flagged by the Labour leader Ivana Bacik this week. Let’s imagine that Acorn is set up for each child, and the families who can save in it do, and the families who can’t save in it don’t — what do you think is going to happen? We are going to see a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.

What we need is for your party and your political colleagues to press STOP on political gimmicks and revisit the genuine, heartfelt reasons you went into politics. We need you to admit the failings of the last few years, we need you to be honest and earnest in your recognition that things have gone wrong, and most importantly we need a commitment to the children of Ireland that you will do more to reduce inequality and ensure that everyone gets the opportunity to shine — and to feel safe.

Title: Farmers have hoarded land for too long. Inheritance tax will bring new life to rural Britain

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/21/2024 9:53:46 PM PST by Jonty30 One of the baleful dimensions of our times is the way that the conversation about what constitutes the good society is framed by the rich and their interests. A conception of the common good withers; instead it is replaced by the existential importance of private wealth, private interests and private ownership to societal health. Nowhere is this more exposed than in the debate over taxation, and in particular the taxation of inherited wealth – as the debate over the past fortnight has dramatised. Half a million people die every year. Under the reforms to inheritance tax relief on agricultural land proposed in the budget, about 500 individuals who inherit land worth more than £2m (£3m if they were married to the deceased) will join the rest of society and have inheritance tax levied on their bequest – albeit at half the rate, with an enlarged exemption and 10 years to pay it, concessions not made to the rest of us. How fortunate and privileged are they?

BlackRock and Grayscale lead rapid $100 billion Bitcoin ETF milestone. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reached an impressive benchmark, crossing $100 billion in net assets. According to SoSoValue data, this achievement represents 5.4% of Bitcoin’s total market value. The 12 Bitcoin ETFs, launched by prominent issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity, have reached this milestone in just 10 months since their debut in January. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which manages $45.4 billion in assets. Grayscale’s GBTC takes the second spot with $20.6 billion, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) follows in third with $18.4 billion. Other notable contributors include the Ark 21 Shares BTC ETF (ARKB) at $4.6 billion and Bitwise BITB at $4 billion. The rapid growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs makes them one of the most successful fund categories to date.

Title: Russia creates plan for division of Ukraine and may offer it to USA - Media

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/21/2024 6:00:12 PM PST by hardspunned The Russian Ministry of Defense has developed a forecast for the evolution of the global military-political situation until 2045, which includes the elimination of Ukraine and its division into parts. Moscow may transmit this plan to the United States through diplomatic channels, according to the Interfax-Ukraine agency. How Russia’s plan looks The first part, according to the Russian plan, involves the so-called new regions of Russia. This refers to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions, and Crimea with Sevastopol, which are to officially become part of the Russian Federation. This is the focus of Moscow today. The second part, according to agency sources, is the pro-Russian state formation. This concerns the creation of a "state" with pro-Russian authorities in the territories of the city of Kyiv, the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, and Zhytomyr regions. This "state formation" will reject European and Euro-Atlantic integration and will agree to a Russian military presence, following the example of Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The third part involves the disputed territories in western Ukraine. These are the Volhynia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Chernivtsi, and Zakarpattia regions, which the Kremlin plans to divide with neighboring Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

Where are you getting these Russian propaganda talking points? Putin has been trying his best to take Ukrainian territory. The story of Ukraine killing ethnic Russians is pure myth. Ukraine passed the law required by Minsk that would have given autonomy to Donbas and was in the process of conducting the required referendum. It was Russia who violated Minsk by not withdrawing its forces, by not handing over the border to Ukraine, and by blocking Ukraine's referendum, all required by Minsk.All the Ukes had to do was to abide by the negotiated Istanbul peace accords and Ukraine would have gotten everything but Crimea back. There was no negotiated agreement at Istanbul, Russia's demands were too high. Nor had Russia agreed to withdraw from the territory that it occupied.Putin will stop today with what he has and a neutral Ukraine. Putin rejected this proposal by Turkey.

This refers to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions, and Crimea with Sevastopol, which are to officially become part of the Russian Federation. This is the focus of Moscow today. The second part, according to agency sources, is the pro-Russian state formation.

This "state formation" will reject European and Euro-Atlantic integration and will agree to a Russian military presence, following the example of Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The third part involves the disputed territories in western Ukraine. These are the Volhynia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Chernivtsi, and Zakarpattia regions, which the Kremlin plans to divide with neighboring Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

Title: ezmsg-blackrock added to PyPI
URL: https://pypi.org/project/ezmsg-blackrock/
Time Published: 2024-11-22T00:22:35Z
Full Content:
pip install ezmsg-blackrock Copy PIP instructions Released: Nov 22, 2024 Blackrock Cerebus ecosystem interface for ezmsg Interface for Blackrock Cerebus ecosystem (incl. Neuroport) using pycbsdk pip install git+https://github.com/CerebusOSS/ezmsg-blackrock IMPORTANT NOTE: pycbsdk is only compatible with Central Neuroport/Cerebus Suite/NSP Firmware 7.0.5+, built using cbhwlib/hardware library/network protocol 3.11+. Anything older is not supported by pycbsdk. Check this requirement in Central by navigating to Help > About Central Blackrock Neuroport/Cerebus uses UDP multicast traffic to deliver upwards of 30000 packets/sec of data with low latency. There are better ways to do this now, but back when this hardware was made, the engineers were dealing with the limitations of the hardware they had. UDP comes with no packet delivery guarantee, but dropped packets can be catastrophic when interfacing with the Blackrock hardware. As such, do your best to locate the highest quality networking equipment you can find, and have a high tolerance for blaming ethernet adapters and/or your router/switch for errors during troubleshooting. The NSP startup procedure involves blasting several thousand UDP packets from the NSP to the interfacing computer in a few milliseconds. Many low-quality adapters and network switches will simply drop some of these UDP packets, but this will result in errors during startup. This setup describes a setup with a Legacy NSP, a Windows PC (called "Central PC") running Central Suite that can configure the NSP, and a third machine (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) that will be running ezmsg-blackrock, henceforth forward referred to as the "Client PC". The documentation highlights the differences when using Blockrock's newer ("Gemini") NSP and Hubs. Central cannot run on the same PC simultaneously as ezmsg-blackrock because pycbsdk exclusively binds the port that central would use to communicate with the NSP. The NSP has too many settings to implement in ezmsg-blackrock, so in practice, we use Central to configure the NSP then acquire live data thereafter. If you want to, you can use ezmsg-blackrock on the Central PC once you've configured the NSP and closed Central. When you do this, the Central PC and the Client PC are the same PC/IP address. Its assumed that this PC is running windows because Central Suite is only available on Windows. Find the highest quality ethernet (yes, wired) network switch or router that you can. Look for 1+ Gigabit speed ratings (2.5 Gigabit better, 10 Gigabit is best), and features like QoS (Quality of Service) that can guarantee packet delivery. Ensure both the Central PC and the Client PC have high quality ethernet network adapters. Not every ethernet adapter will work, due to packet buffering requirements. High quality ethernet cables are also important; aim for Cat6E or better. It is possible to emulate Blackrock hardware while playing back previously recorded data using a software tool called "nPlayServer". The publicly-available and supported nPlayServer is only available on Windows but unsupported Mac and Linux binaries (x86 or ARM) are available. Open an issue to ask. If your intention is to only test on 'localhost' (i.e., ezmsg-blackrock and nPlayServer on the same machine), then there is nothing more to be done. However, if your intention is for the emulation PC to be a different machine than the client PC, nPlayServer must be configured to work over the network. 0.2.2 Nov 22, 2024 0.2.1 Nov 22, 2024 0.2.0 Nov 22, 2024 0.1.0 Nov 22, 2024 Download the file for your platform.

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Nov 21, 2024 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, War | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. “This is a war that should never have happened,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the beginning of the year. “It’s a war the Russians tried repeatedly to settle on terms that were very very beneficial to Ukraine.” “The big military contractors want to add new countries to NATO all the time,” he said. Why? “Because then that country has to conform its military purchases to NATO weapon specifications which means certain companies … get a trapped market,” he explained. Who Really Profits from the Ukraine War? By Wisdom Land, 2 September 2024 Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business – namely, opportunity. It’s not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine’s vast agricultural lands- among the most fertile in the world – are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (“RFK Jr.”) deftly and clearly explains. [You can find a copy of the video above published by RFK Jr. on YouTube HERE and a write-up published by Indian news outlet Times Now World HERE.] JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country’s reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a “blended finance” approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate, and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock, and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The “fund of reconstruction” proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country’s future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company’s presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey’s lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Trending AI Stocks Making Waves Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other trending AI stocks that are making waves today. Is artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn’t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn’t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House. READ NOW: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now The call for equitable AI development and responsible decision-making underscores the growing global focus on AI's impact, and all the latest developments being made in the AI realm. As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country’s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader. News like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many. According to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren’t trained enough (or at all), there’s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools. This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:PANW) offers AI-driven cybersecurity solutions for all apps, users, and devices. On November 21, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a “Buy” rating on Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and raised the price target to $420.00. Several factors, such as the company’s impressive financial performance, and strategic growth initiatives, have led to the rating. The company’s next-generation security ARR has surged 40% year-over-year, reaching $4.5 billion. Meanwhile, its RPO has grown 20% to $12.6 billion. These metrics demonstrate the high demand for Palo Alto’s products. Moreover, the company’s focus on platformization on a unified AI-driven platform and product innovations, including Cortex and SASE, is driving substantial growth and paving the way for further opportunities. Overall PANW ranks 7th on our list of the trending AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

If you're looking for top dividend stocks to buy, you may be tempted to look at which high-yielding stocks are the safest ones to own. The first is that these businesses prioritize dividend growth (which means your recurring income will rise), and the second is that it usually means their operations are also growing and in strong financial shape. Visa (NYSE: V), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) have all increased their dividend payments by more than 90% in just five years. Devon Energy's (NYSE: DVN) stock price has fallen nearly 30% from its 52-week highs.

Title: Do Redditors Think That Altimmune Inc. (ALT) Has a Big Upside Potential?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Reddit Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) stands against the other Redditor-approved stocks. Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, together with Dana D'Auria, Envestnet co-chief Investment Officer, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell: Overtime' on November 12 to discuss the market's reaction to the election results and earnings. Paul Hickey believes that the AI bull market is likely to continue now. This recent conversation centered around the key forces to watch in the current political and economic landscape, particularly in light of potential energy impacts from Ukraine, shifts in Middle Eastern policies, and possible market effects from trade policies with China. Hickey thinks that as President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet begins to take shape, it will provide clearer insights into future expectations. He emphasized that while election results can lower barriers to the market and reduce speed bumps, their impact is often overstated. He notes that over the past 16 years, the market has shown strong performance under different administrations, with annualized returns of 16.3% during both Barack Obama’s and Donald Trump’s first terms, and 14% under Joe Biden. This consistency, according to Hickey, suggests that market returns have remained relatively stable despite varying political landscapes. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing AI bull market, which has been broadening since the summer and is expected to continue. The S&P 500 recently closed above 6,000, reflecting positive momentum in the markets, including gains in the NASDAQ. There was a discussion about how a sweeping victory for one party could have been perceived as detrimental to equities; however, Republicans achieved this outcome and equities responded positively. To maintain this momentum, D'Auria suggested that Republicans might need to exercise more fiscal responsibility. The implication is that a single party cannot implement all its plans without consideration of fiscal implications. D'Auria thinks that as tax cuts from 2017 are likely to be extended under Republican leadership, inflation concerns may arise due to higher tariffs and increased government spending. The Republican stance thus far has been viewed as pro-business, which is reflected in current market performance. However, a potential challenge lies ahead; she is of the idea that stocks are now being priced with expectations of a low regulatory environment. This regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining market growth moving forward. As the market continues to react positively to political developments and the ongoing AI bull market, investors should consider focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Methodology We sifted through threads to compile a list of 30 trending stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 11 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A researcher in a lab coat examining a petri dish of a biopharmaceutical drug. Average Upside Potential as of November 11: 167.76% Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops peptide-based therapeutics for obesity and liver diseases. Its lead drug, Pemvidutide, targets obesity and liver inflammation. They are also developing HepTcell, an immunotherapy for chronic hepatitis B. The company reported positive developments for its drug candidate Pemvidutide, a novel GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist in its obesity program, designed to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It finished enrolling patients in its Phase 2b IMPACT trial (~190 people). This trial assesses Pemvidutide's effectiveness and safety in treating MASH. Top-line data on the drug's success is expected in the second quarter of 2025. If successful, Pemvidutide could become the first MASH treatment to achieve both reduced liver fat and significant weight loss within 24 weeks. Overall, it has finalized the design of four pivotal Phase 3 trials with the FDA to assess the impact on obesity-related comorbidities. Additionally, data from a Phase 2 study highlighted its ability to reduce body fat by 21.9% while preserving lean muscle mass, especially in older adults. To expand Pemvidutide's potential, the company plans to submit IND applications for up to three additional indications by the end of 2024, with the first trial anticipated to start in H1 2025. Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is confident that 2025 will be a significant year for Pemvidutide and the company based on the progress made and upcoming milestones. Overall ALT ranks 2nd on our list of the Redditor-approved stocks with biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ALT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ALT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (This Nov. 21 story has been corrected to fix the Nov. 12, 2024 entry to remove reference to cryptocurrency market value hitting $3 trillion 'for the first time') Bitcoin neared $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president fuelled expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled from this year's low of $38,505 and is up about 45 per cent in the two weeks since Trump's sweeping election win. Here are key events in bitcoin's journey towards $100,000: 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the cryptocurrency's presumed developer, introduces the concept of bitcoin 2010: The first retail transaction takes place when a user pays 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's pizzas 2013: As bitcoin's popularity grows, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, file their first application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments launches the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended private bitcoin trust. 2016: The Winklevoss brothers adjust their application numerous times, such as the exchange on which the product would be traded. They also file amendments naming State Street as administrator. Grayscale files with the SEC to convert its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2017: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss application on the grounds bitcoin markets were not mature enough. Grayscale withdraws its first attempt to convert its trust into an ETF, saying the regulatory environment was not developed enough. 2018: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss twins' second application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, saying cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the necessary controls to prevent manipulation. 2020: Grayscale transforms its trust into an SEC-reporting entity, and its shares begin trading on the pink sheets, for stocks that trade over the counter. Although not an ETF, it is the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S. 2021: The first spot bitcoin ETF launches in Canada. Gary Gensler replaces Jay Clayton as SEC chair in April. In October, the SEC approves the ProShares Bitcoin Trust listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting the CME has a satisfactory mechanism for surveilling abuse in the futures market. It is the first U.S.-listed futures-based bitcoin ETF, accumulating $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading - faster than any other ETF. Also in October, Grayscale again submits an application to the SEC to convert its trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC rejects several applications from would-be spot bitcoin ETF issuers, including SkyBridge, Fidelity and Bitwise. The SEC also rejects Grayscale's application, prompting the company to sue the agency. Amid crashing crypto prices, multiple crypto companies file for bankruptcy, including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is also charged with fraud. 2023: May: Cathie Woods' ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets file for a spot bitcoin ETF, giving the SEC a maximum of 240 days to approve or reject the application. June: BlackRock files a spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, raising industry hopes the agency may approve the product and sending the price of bitcoin to a one-year high. A flurry of other issuers and exchanges, including Fidelity and Invesco, file bitcoin ETF applications in the subsequent weeks and months. August: A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. rules in favor of Grayscale, saying the SEC did not justify why it had rejected its proposal. Europe's first spot bitcoin ETF begins trading on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. October: The SEC opts not to appeal the court's ruling in the Grayscale case and is required to reexamine the application. 2024: Jan. 10: The SEC approves 11 proposals from issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, among others, to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. February: Net inflows into the 10 largest ETFs hit $4 billion in the first month, according to LSEG data. March: Bitcoin tops $70,000 for the first time to hit a record high, having doubled in value in the five months. June: Trump pitches himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser. July: Trump tells a bitcoin conference that, if elected, he will create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and will ensure the United States is the "crypto capital of the planet." October: The SEC grants "accelerated approval" to U.S. exchanges to list and trade options tied to 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Nov 6: Trump is declared winner of the presidential election, sparking a huge rally in a range of assets, with bitcoin being the standout gainer. Nov 12: Total crypto market cap tops $3 trillion. Year-to-date ETF net inflows hit $25.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Nov 21: Bitcoin nears $100,000 for the first time in history, driven by a swell of buying from investors in anticipation of Trump dismantling a lot of the regulation around crypto investment. The price has risen by around 40 per cent since the election.

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. VOTERS IN DUBLIN Mid-West might think they’re seeing double when they open their ballot paper on 29 November. Two candidates with the same name – and similar taste in snazzy spectacles – are standing in the five-seat constituency. There’s Sinn Féin’s high profile housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin – and there’s Independent-turned-Social Democrats councillor for Clondalkin Eoin Ó Broin. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin, on his second canvas of the day at teatime on Tuesday in freezing conditions, is taking no chances: every prospective Sinn Féin voter is warned about the Other Eoin. “Don’t forget, there will be a second Eoin Ó Broin on the ballot,” he explains to one older voter in an estate on the outskirts of Clondalkin village. “Is he with…?” the woman trails off, seemingly confused. “He’s with the Social Democrats. The way it will be on the ballot, my name will be first with my face and the logo. Just follow the face and the logo.” The Eoin Ó Broins of Dublin Mid-West, of Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats respectively. Alamy / TheJournal Alamy / TheJournal / TheJournal The two men know each other. They both live in this area – they’ve even received each other’s post. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin first became aware of his fellow Eoin 20 years ago when, at a conference in Canada, the person introducing him included details in his potted biography seemingly found online in relation to another Eoin Ó Broin, then president of the University of Limerick students’ union. The two met a couple of years later, when Ó Broin (of Sinn Féin) joined a Shell to Sea protest, alighting a bus in Ballinaboy to see “this fella looking at me”. “And I’m look at him, and I’m going: ‘Are you Eoin Ó Broin?’ And he goes: ‘Are you Eoin Ó Broin’? So we had a big chat.” The Social Democrats’ Eoin is a fluent Irish speaker, having attended Irish-medium schools in Clondalkin; there is a large Irish-speaking community in the area, associated with the longstanding Áras Chrónáin cultural centre. Sinn Féin’s Eoin doesn’t speak Irish, but the Irish language surname is on his birth cert; his father attended a Gaelscoil. A few streets away, earlier that day, the Soc Dems’ Eoin Ó Broin doesn’t let the freezing rain stop him from going door to door. Like his fellow Eoin, he’s out twice a day as the election approaches. His biggest pitch to voters, apart from his own track record as a councillor (he got the council to fix a footpath in this particular estate), is his party’s commitment to Sláintecare – the plan to reform healthcare to end the current two-tier system, a policy with which Social Democrats founder Róisín Shortall has been particularly associated. He believes small parties need to be strategic, and the Social Democrats can position themselves as authoritatively on universal access to healthcare as his namesake has managed to do on housing. He adds that he believes Sláintecare would be “transformative” not only for healthcare but for citizens’ relationship with society and the state in Ireland. “I’ve seen a one-tier health system in Sweden, when I lived there. I didn’t need health insurance, and a trip to the doctor was a tenner,” the Soc Dems’ Ó Broin says. “It gives everybody a sense that they’re getting something back. They don’t have this unfortunate bitterness which exists [among] those who are above thresholds.” He believes the Irish system of means-tested thresholds for medical cards is a “Victorian charity” approach, whereas universal access would be “a game changer we need in Ireland for people to feel that we’re all in this together.” Advertisement The Soc Dems’ Ó Broin completed a PhD in energy systems modelling in Sweden, before undertaking postdoctoral research in France. With his background in environmental science, he was a member of the Green movement when he lived in Sweden, but he believes the Green Party do not sufficiently prioritise housing and workers’ rights. In the estate he’s canvassing today, he meets some voters who say he’ll get their number one, and a few undecideds. Do people bring up the name much? “Yeah. Some people say, ‘this will be fun’. Some people say, ‘that’s confusing, you should change your name’.” He is not impressed by this suggestion. “You know, you don’t just change your name. I grew up in Clondalkin, I went to the all-Irish school here, so because I grew up here and it is my name, why should I change?” the Soc Dems candidate says. (Although Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin has been living in Clondalkin for many years with his partner, Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan, he is originally from Cabinteely and went to school in Blackrock. A blow-in Ó Broin, if you will.) Election posters in Clondalkin for Eoin Ó Broin and Eoin Ó Broin. The Journal The Journal Housing, waiting times for healthcare and access to supports for those with disabilities and additional needs are among the top issues that come up on the doorsteps in Clondalkin. Access to school places is also a big issue in this area, where public services do not seem to have kept pace with population growth. Both Eoin Ó Broins say the heat has somewhat gone out of the issue of immigration, relative to the local elections in June; this mirrors what The Journal heard from other constituencies. However, immigration is definitely still on the agenda, and it’s raised a few times with Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin. He pushes back hard against the idea that immigrants are being prioritised on the housing list, as one Sinn Féin voter alleges, telling the man that that “every single one of those families” waited on the list for the same length of time as Irish families. “The only people who get council houses are people who have a legal right to reside and work with the state,” he says. However at another house (also voting Sinn Féin) he criticises the government for not consulting with the local community on a nearby accommodation centre for people seeking international protection. He tells a couple who say they’re concerned about the safety of women in the area that “a lot of concerns that you have, which are genuine concerns, can be addressed” through immigration being “properly managed”. “It’s the fear of not knowing what’s going on in your own community, and that’s why, for me, community engagement and consultation is key, right? People are gonna come, right? You can’t stop people coming, but what you have to make sure is when people arrive to claim international protection, there’s a proper process,” Ó Broin tells them. It is understood there have not been any incidents affecting the safety of local residents involving residents of this accommodation centre. Sinn Féin’s immigration manifesto, launched last week, promises to take the provision of accommodation for international protection applicants into complete state control, and pledges that new purpose built centres will not be located in deprived communities. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin explains that to protect “community cohesion”, good quality accommodation has to provided in communities that “have capacity”, not in those that have been marginalised, and which are struggling already with a lack of basic infrastructure. He says these areas are identifiable using the deprivation index produced by Pobal, the state’s social inclusion agency. By that metric, would areas in this constituency be suitable for new centres – in, say, Lucan, much of which is classified as “affluent” or “very affluent” by Pobal? Ó Broin seems to accept this could indeed by the case, telling The Journal that “the definition of ‘deprived’ is objective, and it has to be”, and adding that “large parts of Dublin city” would be deemed suitable for new centres under Sinn Féin’s plan. However, he adds that Sinn Féin would additionally require audits of local services to check whether there are enough school places and GP places before new accommodation for international protection applicants is approved. Related Reads Soc Dems pledge to spend €5.5 billion on disability legislation reform if in Government 'We want to go into government': SocDems says 50,000 affordable homes is red line issue It sounds like you could rule out almost every area of Dublin with those additional criteria? “No, I don’t believe that,” Ó Broin says, reiteriating that he “absolutely” believes there are areas of Dublin that would right now be suitable for new asylum accommodation. He adds that while he advocates for more community consultation, he does not believe anyone should get a “veto” in the same way that nobody gets to veto Irish people moving into their area. “It’s about respect. It’s about engagement. It’s about talking to people, letting people know what the plan is,” he says. Sinn Féin wants to lead Ireland’s first left-wing government after the election, so if it gets enough seats there’s no doubt Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns will be getting a call from her counterpart, Mary Lou McDonald. For her part, Cairns has indicated she hasn’t ruled out taking that call and talking to Sinn Féin. What do the two Eoin Ó Broins think are the biggest points of difference between their parties? Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin says: “Sinn Fein is the only political party that can lead an alternative government of change. So if people want a change of government, they really need to think wisely as to where they give that vote.” He adds that there are “significant policy differences” between the two parties; the examples he gives are USC (Sinn Féin wants to reduce this tax and the Social Democrats don’t) and the fact that a united Ireland is a “key part of [Sinn Féin's] agenda”. He acknowledges that on healthcare and childcare the two parties’ policies “chime”, but claims Sinn Féin’s housing and other policies are more comprehensive. The other Eoin Ó Broin says the Social Democrats are a “coherent, centre-left party in an international left-wing tradition, whereas Sinn Féin struggle to define where they are politically”. “Migration is a good example,” he says, instancing Sinn Féin’s election literature ahead of the June local elections, which stated that the party was opposed to open borders. “That’s rhetoric borrowed from the United States. The EU has open borders by default. There’s an open border with Northern Ireland that they fought very hard to keep. So it’s that kind of inconsistency, I would say, which differentiates us,” the Social Democrats’ Ó Broin says. He adds that he believes it to be “disingenuous to people” for Sinn Féin “put it out there that we can have a society without property taxes or carbon taxes”. “We’re solid that we want healthcare, education, childcare, elderly care, to be available free at the point of use and paid for by tax, and we’re strong on the environment as well,” he adds. Dublin Mid-West gains an extra seat in this election, so Sinn Féin will be hoping it can once again return two TDs, Ó Broin and Mark Ward. Fine Gael TD Emer Higgins will also try to bring in a running mate, while Fianna Fáil, which lost its seat in 2020, is also running two candidates. People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny is running again. The Social Democrats aren’t the only party to have poached an Independent councillor – Labour has nabbed Clondalkin’s longstanding council poll-topper, Francis Timmons. Independent councillor and former Green Party TD Paul Gogarty, who topped the poll in the June elections in Lucan, could benefit from the fact that the incumbent TDs skew to the Clondalkin end of the constituency, while Independent Ireland councillor Linda de Courcey is running on an immigration platform. There are also candidates from the Greens and Aontú, as well as the anti-EU Irish Freedom Party and anti-immigration Irish People Party, along with other Independents.

Title: Bitcoin Barrels Close To $98,000—Is The $100K Barrier Next?

Bitcoin continues its price explosion this Thursday, hitting a new all-time high and breaking the $97,000 barrier during intra-day trading. The crypto asset’s price then spiked 5.7%, reaching $97,811 on Bitstamp, boosting its market cap to $1.93 trillion. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value is not just a market trend, but a reflection of the growing optimism surrounding incoming US President Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies and his pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief. This optimism has led to a 3% increase in the cumulative cryptocurrency market cap, now standing at $3.37 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume on Thursday saw a 5% increase, reaching $ 190 billion. The obvious sign of the optimistic trend in the bitcoin market: its price has more than doubled this year. The whole industry has joined the upward surge, contributing an amazing $900 billion to the total crypto market capitalization. Given that Bitcoin is barely $3,000 short of the $100,000 milestone, the sector is bursting with hope about what the next few weeks can bring for the digital asset. According to Edu Patel, CEO of Mudrex, Bitcoin’s price last year was $30,000. Today, the asset’s price surged to more than $97,000, reflecting a growth of over 300%. Patel said several factors are pushing Bitcoin’s price, including Trump’s election and optimism over his pick as chairman of the SEC, and his friendly crypto policies. In addition, he also acknowledged the growing institutional participation in Bitcoin options and ETFs. The recent price surge of Bitcoin underscores the growing importance of the asset and cryptocurrency to the economy. The Trump administration has also signaled the possibility of creating a specific office to oversee the administration’s cryptocurrency policies. According to some sources, the president’s team is currently considering this office, and many crypto execs are jockeying for an audience with the president. 1/ MicroStrategy just convinced investors to pay $520,234 per Bitcoin That’s the biggest Bitcoin play I’ve ever seen: pic.twitter.com/yeZfGlcm6j — ELI5 of TLDR (@explain_briefly) November 20, 2024 Some experts also attribute Bitcoin’s recent run to MicroStrategy’s bold “Bitcoin-first” policy. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy has doubled down on this approach and purchased additional BTC to boost its portfolio. Other companies have followed suit and are planning to add the asset to their inventories. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs also helps, and the market currently benefits from the introduction of options trading. According to multiple sources, more than $4 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs since the November elections. Also, this week, Reuters reports that BlackRock is off to an exciting start with its BTC ETFs with call options.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Do Redditors Think That Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Has a Big Upside Potential?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Reddit Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) stands against the other Redditor-approved stocks. Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, together with Dana D'Auria, Envestnet co-chief Investment Officer, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell: Overtime' on November 12 to discuss the market's reaction to the election results and earnings. Paul Hickey believes that the AI bull market is likely to continue now. This recent conversation centered around the key forces to watch in the current political and economic landscape, particularly in light of potential energy impacts from Ukraine, shifts in Middle Eastern policies, and possible market effects from trade policies with China. Hickey thinks that as President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet begins to take shape, it will provide clearer insights into future expectations. He emphasized that while election results can lower barriers to the market and reduce speed bumps, their impact is often overstated. He notes that over the past 16 years, the market has shown strong performance under different administrations, with annualized returns of 16.3% during both Barack Obama’s and Donald Trump’s first terms, and 14% under Joe Biden. This consistency, according to Hickey, suggests that market returns have remained relatively stable despite varying political landscapes. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing AI bull market, which has been broadening since the summer and is expected to continue. The S&P 500 recently closed above 6,000, reflecting positive momentum in the markets, including gains in the NASDAQ. There was a discussion about how a sweeping victory for one party could have been perceived as detrimental to equities; however, Republicans achieved this outcome and equities responded positively. To maintain this momentum, D'Auria suggested that Republicans might need to exercise more fiscal responsibility. The implication is that a single party cannot implement all its plans without consideration of fiscal implications. D'Auria thinks that as tax cuts from 2017 are likely to be extended under Republican leadership, inflation concerns may arise due to higher tariffs and increased government spending. The Republican stance thus far has been viewed as pro-business, which is reflected in current market performance. However, a potential challenge lies ahead; she is of the idea that stocks are now being priced with expectations of a low regulatory environment. This regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining market growth moving forward. As the market continues to react positively to political developments and the ongoing AI bull market, investors should consider focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. In that context, we're here with a list of the 11 Reddit stocks with biggest upside potential to help you diversify your portfolio. Methodology We sifted through Reddit threads to compile a list of 30 trending stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 11 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential.

This company's IQ microinverters are expanding into new markets, including Japan, where the company is targeting a 1.3 gigawatt market. The IQ8P commercial microinverter is gaining traction in the US, with over 380 sites installed. It is also developing the IQ9 microinverter, powered by Gallium Nitride technology, which will offer higher power output and support elevated AC grid voltages. The company reported a 30.89% year-over-year revenue decline in Q3, reaching $380.87 million. Despite this, Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) saw a 13% sequential growth, shipping 1.73 million microinverters and 172.9 megawatt-hours of IQ batteries. It is poised to capitalize on international markets, especially in Brazil, India, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Currently, the main driver for its growth remains the US market, where revenue increased 43% sequentially. While the company has faced challenges due to the declining solar demand and rising interest rates, its long-term growth prospects remain promising. Overall ENPH ranks 11th on our list of the Reddit stocks with biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ENPH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trump’s Crypto Advisory Council to setup promised Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Report

Time Published: 2024-11-21T20:13:59Z

Major U.S.-based crypto companies are seeking a seat at the council, which will advise on crypto policy and work with Congress on legislation. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Crypto Advisory Council” is expected to establish his promised “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” Reuters reported on Nov. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. While presidential advisory councils are not new, a dedicated crypto council would be unprecedented, reflecting the sector’s rapid evolution since Bitcoin’s inception in 2008. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith emphasized the urgency of the council’s formation, stating it is “something Trump could do very quickly.” According to the report, the council will also advise on crypto policy and work with Congress on crypto legislation. It added that the council may be housed under the White House’s National Economic Council or operate independently. According to industry insiders, major US-based companies, including Coinbase, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, a16z, Ripple, Kraken, and Circle, are seeking a seat on the council. Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, a key organizer behind Trump’s July appearance at a Nashville Bitcoin Conference, said: “It’s being fleshed out, but I anticipate the leading executives from America’s Bitcoin and crypto firms to be represented.” Excitement over Trump’s pro-crypto stance has already buoyed Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which touched a new all-time high of $99,100 on Nov. 21. Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter is discussing introducing legislation in Texas on a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” The Texas movement is Porter’s latest effort to introduce a dedicated Bitcoin reserve to a US state. On Nov. 14, Pennsylvania, through Representative Mike Cabell, introduced a bill to create a BTC reserve using the state’s $7 billion fund. The proposal suggests an initial allocation of up to 10% in Bitcoin but also acknowledges that a smaller exposure of 1% to 5% could be a more suitable starting point. After Pennsylvania’s proposal, Porter stated that up to 10 more US states will likely follow suit this year, with Texas potentially being the first. Additionally, he previously told CryptoSlate that state governments are rushing to pass legislation establishing their own BTC Reserves, as President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is considering an executive order to formalize this matter. The idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gained traction following Trump’s election. During his presidential campaign, he displayed a pro-crypto stance, and one of his promises was to create a BTC reserve in the U.S. Treasury. This idea was quickly backed by pro-crypto politicians, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, who introduced legislation for such reserve called “The Bitcoin Act” and believes Trump could approve it in his first 100 days at the White House. The council will likely coordinate with regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury, to craft crypto policy and streamline enforcement efforts. Trump’s team is also reportedly considering creating a “crypto czar” role to lead the council, with candidates such as former CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert, ex-Commissioner Brian Quintenz, and former SEC chief Christopher Giancarlo under consideration. The move comes as Trump promises to reverse President Joe Biden’s stringent enforcement actions. The administration is expected to prioritize executive orders that ensure crypto companies’ access to banking services, halt enforcement actions, and position the industry as a strategic economic asset. Critics, including consumer advocacy groups, caution against allowing the crypto industry to heavily influence policymaking, warning of potential conflicts of interest. Some ethics considerations may delay appointments, though industry leaders argue that experienced voices are essential for crafting effective regulations. Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley stated: “It’s absolutely the wise choice to put together a council of people who… understand how both the industry ought to be regulated and how to situate the industry to be a strategic asset.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). AJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade. Specializing in financial journalism, he now focuses on crypto reporting. Daily digest of top crypto stories and market insights. Never miss out. The Blockchain Association has outlined several issues that need to addressed by Trump with the first 100 days of his administration to support the crypto industry.

Title: Citadel founder Ken Griffin said he would be 'open' to selling a stake in his $65 billion hedge fund

BlackRock's potential investment into Izzy Englander's Millennium might have Citadel founder Ken Griffin thinking. At the Economic Club of New York Thursday, Griffin complimented BlackRock founder Larry Fink for being a "legend in asset management" and said that if the tie-up eventually does go through, "it's a very interesting" one. The early-stage talks between BlackRock and multistrategy rival Millennium were reported by the Financial Times earlier this month. Asked if he would consider such a move, the billionaire said he'd "be open to selling a minority stake," which Citadel, the $65 billion hedge fund that's become the most profitable firm in the industry's history, has never done. "We take great pride in being a private partnership," he said, and believes the structure has helped the firm run smoothly for the more than 30 years it's been in existence. Nearly every hedge fund is still owned by its founders and a select group of partners, even the older industry giants like Citadel, though Griffin may be looking to sell a stake at the peak. He said in a Bloomberg interview on Tuesday that the extreme growth that has added billions of assets to his fund and his peers' is not likely to continue. In New York Thursday, he pointed out the benefits of selling a stake in his market maker Citadel Securities in 2022 to venture capital firms Sequoia and Paradigm for more than $1 billion. The investment valued the firm at $22 billion. He said Sequoia in particular brought "real insights" into how to manage a rapidly growing company, noting the firm's past investments into Apple and Nvidia before the two companies were public. Griffin said Sequoia has pushed Citadel Securities' leadership in the boardroom, making them a better company. As for who he'd want as a minority stakeholder of Citadel, Griffin clearly has a type. "We'd look for a partner that feels like Sequoia," he said. Jump to

By Carolina Mandl NEW YORK (Reuters) -Citadel's founder Ken Griffin said on Thursday that he would be open to selling a small stake in his hedge fund at some point in the future. Griffin, at an event hosted by the Economic Club of New York, said it made sense for him to sell a minority stake in his market maker Citadel Securities to Sequoia and Paradigm in 2022, in a deal that valued the firm at $22 billion. His comments come days after reports about BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) in talks with Citadel's competitor Millennium for a potential tie-up, involving the acquisition of a minority stake in the hedge fund by the world's largest asset manager. "We take great pride in being in a private partnership. It has served us well for 30 years," he said when asked about a potential consolidation in the hedge fund industry. Still, he said he "would be open to the possibility of selling a minority stake in Citadel at some point in the future." When asked about what kind of partner he would engage with, he said venture capital firm Sequoia would be an example. "We would look for a partner that feels like Sequoia, that's going to push us to be better at what we do." Griffin said the focus on Citadel Securities now is on the growth of the business and that an initial public offering should not happen "in the foreseeable future." Griffin, a Republican supporter, criticized in a wide-ranging interview President-elect Donald Trump's plans for deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, tax cuts and tariffs implementation, saying some of his policies could increase the U.S. deficit and make domestic companies less competitive and productive. "We've got to put the fiscal house to order," he said.

Title: Can Bitcoin Solve The Sovereign Debt Crisis?

Time Published: 2024-11-21T18:12:07Z

Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images The United States is facing a fiscal crisis of historic proportions. Ballooning deficits, runaway debt service costs, and the risk of a bond market meltdown are pushing the nation toward uncharted territory. Traditional solutions, whether austerity, tax hikes, or controlled inflation, are inadequate. Could a radically different approach, leveraging bitcoin, chart a path forward? A thoughtful post by @stackhodler on X entertained the idea that bitcoin could play a role in addressing a sovereign debt crisis. This thought experiment requires an understanding of how money systems evolve during times of upheaval, plus a little imagination. From the collapse of the Roman denarius to the end of the Bretton Woods gold standard, monetary resets are not new. How might bitcoin kick off the next chapter in global money? The problem starts with unsustainable debt. In the wake of trillions in COVID-era spending, the U.S. has grown dependent on short-term Treasury bills, leaving its finances vulnerable to rising interest rates. Government spending is totally out of control, and the number of people who are partially or wholly dependent on government transfer payments has mushroomed. For all the consternation among conservatives about Democratic policies moving the U.S. in the direction of socialism, there is surprisingly little attention paid to the reality that it is already here. As outlined in our earlier analysis, there is a danger that rising interest rates could lead to a debt spiral in Trump’s second term. Higher borrowing costs would beget more borrowing, which would fuel yet higher costs. This would apply inflationary pressure to the dollar that would be difficult to counteract, even with the radical spending cuts promised by the DOGE initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This feedback loop is hard to escape in the fiat system. Tax hikes slow growth, spending cuts invite backlash, and inflation – though politically expedient in the short term – would destroy the purchasing power of the voting public. The result is a dollar teetering on collapse, where global competitors like China use its weakness to siphon soft power away from the United States. The question is: how could bitcoin fit into a solution for sovereign debt? Don your tinfoil hat and get ready to entertain a fascinating, if speculative, scenario. As U.S. policymakers recognize the inevitability of a monetary reset, the first move would be strategic devaluation of the dollar. By flooding global markets with dollars, the U.S. would trigger inflation across rival economies, destabilizing their currencies while counterintuitively protecting the dollar’s status as the premiere global reserve currency. Sound familiar? The inflationary result of the COVID and post-COVID debt bonanza was predictable, leaving one to speculate about why the powers-that-be allowed it to transpire. The explanation need not require a grand conspiracy. The Cantillion Effect is reason enough. On an individual level, powerful politicians and financiers store their wealth in assets, not cash. Printing money does not put them at risk, since more dollars chasing the same number of scarce assets simply raises the prices of the assets they already own. And because they can use their privileged position to acquire assets with the newly printed money faster than the broader market can, they are even able to increase their wealth by snapping up more before inflation causes prices to rise. Combine that with the power to route newly printed dollars to institutions (and stakeholders within them), and you have strong incentive alignment among elites to spend as much money as quickly as they can. If they agreed in aggregate that the dollar’s demise is inevitable, you would expect to see them racing to print dollars and scoop up assets, while using their political power to bestow money (and the assets it can buy) upon those in their trust networks to strengthen their positions in the social hierarchy. This logic is sound, if perverse, and it would explain why the U.S. government spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily under the guise of COVID spending after the crisis was long over. If you’re in a car careening at high speed towards a chasm, and your brakes don’t work, you press down on the accelerator and hope that by increasing your speed you might make the jump to the other side. The other side is bitcoin – not because bitcoin is perfect or desirable, but simply because there is no alternative. For over a decade, the U.S. government has battled bitcoin – from the unjust withholding of approval to sell financial products that touch it, to the frontal attack on bitcoin-friendly banks by the Biden-Harris administration. However, in 2024, the tune suddenly changed. The ultimate Big Finance insider, BlackRock, began selling and promoting bitcoin. Pension funds, family offices, and individual investors now have easy access to bitcoin exposure, with no need of technical knowledge. Now that capital markets are open to large-scale adoption of bitcoin, the U.S. is free to pivot to endorse it as a reserve asset. Whether or not it is yet happening, it’s now indisputably possible for the masses to use bitcoin as a hedge against the declining dollar. If the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve comes to fruition and the U.S. Department of the Treasury begins purchasing and holding bitcoin, other nations would need to compete by doing the same. Some would sell assets – including U.S. Treasury bonds. Others would print their currencies to purchase it. The result would be further acceleration of capital exiting the fiat system and entering the bitcoin ledger. Suppose the U.S. Treasury acquires significant bitcoin reserves while simultaneously allowing the dollar to slide into oblivion. As bitcoin appreciates – potentially into multi-million-dollar territory – it could offset the national debt in nominal terms. A hyperinflating dollar paired with appreciating bitcoin reserves would invert the current debt dynamic, allowing liabilities to shrink relative to assets. Perhaps this is what President Trump was gesturing at when he suggested that the U.S. could pay off its $35 trillion debt with bitcoin. Much derided at the time, could this have been another example of Trump’s intuition being correct, if not clearly expressed? Transitioning from the dollar to bitcoin wouldn’t come without pain. Dollar hyperinflation would create chaos and dislocation across the entire planet. But bitcoin would provide the foundation on which to rebuild. And, those holding bitcoin – governments, financial institutions, and individuals – would have their wealth preserved through the upheaval. Now that Americans have clearly marked exits from fiat to bitcoin, the U.S. economy could emerge in the 21st century strongly positioned to continue its dominance, while late adopters scramble to adjust. If bitcoin were to become a global reserve asset, it would kick off a new era of fiscal discipline. Unlike fiat, bitcoin’s fixed supply imposes natural constraints on government spending, forcing policymakers to operate within the bounds of solvency. Reckless deficit spending, forever wars, and currency debasement would become relics of the fiat past. A bitcoin-based financial system wouldn’t just rein in excess, it would also encourage investment in ultra-long-term, ambitious projects. Bitcoin would be used to underwrite energy resource development, infrastructure revitalization, and most importantly, interplanetary expansion. Freed from the distortions of fiat monetary policy, markets could allocate capital efficiently, fostering an explosion of productive growth. This scenario is not as far-fetched as it may first seem. By historical standards, the dollar is past its sell-by date, and the postwar “rules-based international order” is clearly under renegotiation. World reserve currency periods.
