We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 11 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) stands against other best NASDAQ penny stocks to buy right now. The NASDAQ Stock Market is home to some of the world’s largest companies in the world and also hosts several hundred penny stocks. These companies must meet certain requirements to remain listed on the NASDAQ exchange, including the $1 per share minimum share price thresholds, revenue standards, and market capitalization thresholds. If a company fails to meet these requirements, it may receive noncompliance notifications and eventually be delisted. According to a report by Bloomberg, this year’s market rally has boosted many of the struggling stocks, helping some companies regain compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirements. On December 3, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller, while addressing a conference in Washington, indicated that he is inclined to vote for a rate cut at the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on December 17-18. However, Waller emphasized that his decision will depend on the economic data released before the meeting, particularly if it shows an unexpected uptick in inflation. According to Bloomberg, New York Fed President John Williams in a speech in New York said that the economy is continuing to look strong and inflation is likely moving down toward the Fed’s target. However, he emphasized that the path for monetary policy will be contingent upon incoming economic data. He underscored the uncertainty of the economic outlook, noting, “If we’ve learned anything over the past five years, it’s that the outlook remains highly uncertain.” READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. In an interview with CNBC on November 15, Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research, discussed his views on the US stocks and the potential of small caps. Colas recalled how U.S. stocks outperformed global markets during the first Trump administration. Colas acknowledged that current multiples are high, but he is optimistic and believes that multiples can hold or even rise, given the high level of confidence in the US market. Regarding small caps, Colas suggested that they are a great trade for the year-end. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap performance, has been flat and lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the past three years, and presents an amazing opportunity, given that it typically sees a 20% increase. This underperformance makes small caps reasonable holds for the longer term, as they are due for a rebound. While the broader market is showing signs of overvaluation, small-cap, and penny stocks have lagged significantly behind over the past few years, creating a compelling opportunity for investors.

We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period.

According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AVGO), a technology company, offers custom chip offerings and networking assets that has helped it establish a strong position in the AI space. On December 9, JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained an Overweight rating on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $210. With the technology company set to report its earnings on Thursday, the firm remains bullish on the stock on the back of a strong demand profile for AI products, continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets, and unlocked VMWare revenue synergy. Sur affirmed that software renewals from major corporate customers will lead to strong growth in the VMWare business, a cloud computing technology company that Broadcom acquired in November 2023. Overall, the analyst projects revenue and EPS upside for the full year, continued strong demand for AI products, and a coordinated end market recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets for fiscal year 2025. With a $30 billion pipeline of AI revenue opportunities per AI customer over the next 4-5 years, and strong VMWare momentum, Sur projects strong dividend growth and sustained AI leadership for the company. “Broadcom is set to report October quarter (F4Q24) earnings Thursday, and we continued to see a strong demand profile for its AI products combined with continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets (e.g., enterprise, server/storage) and VMWare revenue synergy unlock.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of AI news that broke the internet.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) stands against the other quantum computing stocks. Quantum computing stocks are once again in focus after yesterday's major breakthrough announcement by one of the biggest players in this field. Investors have had high expectations from quantum computing firms for many years, but the technology has consistently failed to deliver on the promise. However, a deeper understanding of the tech behind quantum computing is required to fully understand the complexity of the issue. Quantum computers were theorized in the 1980s, but their development has been fraught with challenges due to the fragility of qubits. Unlike traditional computers that use binary bits, like ones and zeroes, quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Qubit fragility typically leads to higher error rates for quantum computers. Companies have tried to address qubit fragility through innovations — ranging from light particles to trapped ions, but few have been successful. However, latest breakthroughs in this field herald the arrival of quantum supremacy - a term used to explain the processing power of quantum computers compared to traditional ones. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Since the latest breakthroughs showcase that quantum computers can accomplish tasks in minutes that would otherwise take ten septillion years - exceeding the age of the universe - it would be reasonable to assume that quantum computers can now move on from accomplishing mundane tasks like generating random numbers or solving specific mathematical problems, towards practical applications in drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and cryptography. This has huge implications for investors who are increasingly frustrated by the plateauing advancement in the field of AI and are actively exploring for emerging opportunities in the tech field that offer explosive growth potential along the same lines. Sylvia Jablonski, the CEO of Defiance ETFs, appeared on news platform CNBC earlier this year to highlight this. “The way I see markets today is the absolute fervor and interest in all things A.I. and A.I. is the tide that rises all boats. I think quantum is the next generation of A.I. You need it to process data and make changes in all of the sectors we have been talking about that A.I. has been impacting with drug discovery and curing diseases. Just as AI is powering progress in not just the computer industry, but in fields that adopt the use of AI, quantum computing will be used in processing data for sectors already being transformed by AI, such as drug discovery and curing diseases.” Read more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected quantum computing stocks by sifting through the holdings of popular quantum computing ETFs. The stocks listed below are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17 IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) engages in the development of general-purpose quantum computing systems in the United States. The surging investor interest in quantum computing has helped push the shares up by close to 200% year-to-date. It is one of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds as it offers pure exposure to the quantum industry and has demonstrated stronger commercial traction. For example, in the third quarter, the company posted a revenue of $12.4 million, up more than 102% year-on-year. This performance was driven by over $63 million in new bookings by the quantum computing firm, including a $54 million contract with the US Air Force Research Lab to develop networked quantum systems. The quantum computers marketed by the firm make use of trapped ion quantum computing technology. This offers high stability and connectivity between qubits. Unlike traditional computers, which use binary units to process data, qubits process the zeroes and ones of binary units simultaneously. This speeds up processing times. To put this into context, the latest Forte Enterprise system marketed by IonQ can process 34 billion scenarios simultaneously. IonQ has also been expanding partnerships with major companies to gain mainstream recognition. For example, the firm recently announced that it would partner with pharma giant AstraZeneca to develop quantum applications for drug discovery and development. Earlier, it had also announced a deal with software firm Ansys to bring quantum applications to computer-aided engineering. Most recently, the quantum computing company revealed that it would be purchasing Qubitekk, a firm that designs, builds and integrates the hardware and software for quantum networks. Overall IONQ ranks 6th on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of IONQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IONQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A data analyst pouring over a chart, the intricacies of its lines being revealed. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2 Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) is an integrated photonics company that offers accessible and affordable quantum machines. Even though the firm is small, with a market capitalization of around $880 million, it is one of the best quantum computing stocks according to hedge funds. One of the reasons for this is the significant momentum behind the stock, with shares rallying close to 750% so far this year, as investors bet big on the company to deliver on the promises of quantum technologies and products under development. In late November, the firm announced that it had secured two orders for the thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip foundry. TFLN is a cutting edge material used in high-powered computers. This material operates with an extremely high bandwidth and with lower insertion losses, and is likely to be a key enabler of the 1.6 and 3.2 terabit optical switches and interconnects used by hyperscalers in their AI data centers. TFLN is presently only sourced in small quantities from China. However, Quantum Computing plans to open a fully commissioned TFLN fabrication facility in Arizona by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The firm stated in a policy paper published earlier this year that once the facility is functional, it would become the only company in the United States capable of processing 150 mm wafers. TFLN chips can be used for a variety of purposes, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, high-frequency modulators, and LiDAR. Overall QUBT ranks 10th on our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Title: West Palm Beach Sees Retail Real Estate Boom Thanks to Influx of New Residents
URL: http://wwd.com/business-news/real-estate/west-palm-beach-retail-real-estate-boom-new-residents-1236753965/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily COVID-19 drove a surge in newcomers to the area, and real estate companies are rapidly developing new residences, office buildings and hospitality and retail properties. Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates the island of Palm Beach from the city of West Palm Beach on the mainland, once cut a clear demarcation between the haves and have-nots. But their metaphorical distance creeps closer each year with the island’s geographic limitations and West Palm Beach’s transformation into a happening, waterfront destination for millionaires, and perhaps even billionaires, to live, work and play. “It started before COVID[-19], but then COVID[-19] turbocharged everything,” said Jordan Bargas, senior vice president of development for West Palm Beach, Fla.-based Related Ross, regarding the rampant development of luxury residences; office buildings, especially for wealth management firms, and upscale restaurants and retail, often imported from New York and Miami that cater to the nascent “Wall Street South” crowd, among a tidal wave of multigenerational newcomers. Related Articles Architecture Italian Luxury Furniture-maker Natuzzi Forays Into Private Residential With Dubai Residence Real Estate Tanger Posts Solid Q3 Results, Raises 2024 Guidance Again “South Flagler House, our property under construction that’s designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects with units averaging $15 million, is the perfect example of people who live on the island and are purchasing in West Palm Beach now. Previously, they wouldn’t have been caught dead here,” he added. You May Also Like Workers at the city’s new and slated financial tenants including Goldman Sachs, Elliott, JPMorgan Chase, Millennium, BlackRock and Point72 also desire homes in planned, high-end projects here, from Mr. C Residences to The Ritz-Carlton Residences. Economic research firm TPX projects Vanderbilt University’s pending downtown satellite campus will add another 35,000 local jobs within a quarter century. The school’s staff, along with its nearly 1,000 graduate program students, will need housing too. The shift toward more discerning residents means apartment rentals like Related Ross’ The Laurel are expected to deliver premier amenities on par with condominiums, whether resort-style pools or golf simulators. Onsite brands sweeten the deal. Equinox leased 35,000 square feet above The Laurel’s ground-level retailers Alo and Crate & Barrel. RH, whose rooftop restaurant draws society page names from Palm Beach, jumpstarted CityPlace’s needle-mover migration in 2017. “It was a huge signal of confidence in the market,” said Bargas, of fresh commitments, from Eataly’s second Florida location launching in a former church to home decor e-tailer Perigold’s foray into brick-and-mortar. “Eataly will be a big anchor that brings pedestrian traffic. We’re setting up this place for the next 20 years.” Walkability, activations and art also drive the success of CityPlace and the overall neighborhood. Related Ross commissioned Fred Eversley’s largest public installation Portals for its One Flagler luxury office tower with an Estiatorio Milos restaurant due. Among CityPlace’s 500 annual events, last month’s holiday lights kickoff drew 5,000 people; New Wave Art Wknd organized public art tours and conversation panels in December, and fitness and wellness festival District Fit returns in March. Space doesn’t sit idle for long. While awaiting construction to begin, vacant lots and high-profile corners host makeshift experiences; current pop-ups include Bal Harbour Shops Access, SoulCycle and CityPickle. Related Ross’s total square footage of 6.6 million square feet breaks down into 3.25 million square feet for offices, 1.9 million square feet for residential and 700,000 square feet each for hotels and retail/restaurants. Asked whether fashion remains a viable component (The Laurel was once home to Macy’s), Bargas said, “Clothing is still important, and we’re about to sign a fashion company that appeals to women in their 20s to 40s.” If CityPlace and the Flagler waterfront mirror New York’s SoHo and uptown environs, the Nora District is West Palm Beach’s answer to New York’s downtown scene. An abbreviation of North Railroad Avenue, the trackside enclave where 19th-century developer Henry Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railroad sped up South Florida’s real estate boom, combines historic warehouses and new buildings throughout 40 acres and 2.5 million square feet. The public-private partnership between the city of West Palm Beach and development firms NDT Development, Place Projects and Wheelock Street Capital created a master plan from 2019 to 2022, with initial phases premiering over the next two years. Infrastructure improvements call for new water and sewer lines, storm drainage and widened sidewalks as well as burying power lines. Miami-based ArquitectonicaGEO has been commissioned for streetscapes, landscaping and outdoor seating; a new, old-fashioned cobblestone street creates a sense of place, and green spaces feature pockets parks and a sculpture garden combined with a play area. Joe Furst, founder and managing principal for Place Projects in Miami, said compelling infrastructure, like installing an underground grease trap system, attracted hospitality businesses. “We’re taking that cost away from restaurateurs. All [retail] buildings can be used for food and beverage, which is why those leases did well in advance,” he said, of confirmed tenants such as New York’s Pastis, Juliana’s Pizza, Van Leeuwen Ice Cream and H&H Bagels; Boston’s Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar; Naples, Fla.’s Del Mar Mediterranean; Madison, N.J.’s Sunday Motor Co., and locally born Celis Juice Bar & Café. In getting ahead of growth, Furst implements lessons learned from developing Miami’s Wynwood District as Goldman Properties’ managing director for a decade. He said their early-stage strategies are nothing alike. “We aren’t just slapping paint on buildings like Wynwood but delivering Class-A retail from the start for sophisticated operators with more than one concept,” said Furst, who also eschewed Wynwood’s signature graffitied façades for different art mediums like artist Carolyn Salas’ aluminum wall sculpture. “Rather than giving away space to get people to come in and having tenant turnover and displacement as rents increase, tenants are signing 10- to -20-year leases here.” Anchored by the 201-room Nora Hotel from New York hoteliers Richard Born, Ira Drukier and Sean MacPherson with nods to Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner, the lifestyle mix features IGK salon, Solidcore Pilates, Sana Skin Studio, The Spot Barbershop, Long Island-based womenswear specialty chain Mint, and ZenHippo’s first flagship for its family programs in Palm Beach County. Apartments, condominiums and office buildings will also add density. Bargas feels West Palm Beach’s retail options, including downtown’s Clematis Street, complement each other and are necessary for the city to evolve to the next level. “Businesses aren’t coming to these different areas because they can get a deal. It’s more about where is my brand best reflected and where will it have the most success.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Why Is APi Group Corp. (APG) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. Our Methodology For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers surveying a construction site in preparation for a new underground infrastructure. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $848.9 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) is a leading safety services provider specializing in end-to-end integrated occupancy systems, including fire protection, HVAC, and entry systems. Its offerings span design, installation, inspection, and maintenance services, catering to customers across the energy, industrial, and commercial sectors. On November 24, Baird raised its price target for APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) stock from $39 to $40, maintaining an Outperform rating. This revision followed analysts’ site visits and assessments of APG’s recent acquisition and its implications for growth. During these visits, Baird analysts engaged with APG field management and customers, marking the first investor-focused visit to Elevated, the company’s newly acquired elevator maintenance division. Baird highlighted that this acquisition significantly broadens APG’s service portfolio and establishes a promising platform for future mergers and acquisitions. APi Group Corp. (NYSE:APG) also reported solid growth during its Q3 2024 earnings call. Revenue increased by 2.4% year-over-year to $1.83 billion, driven by organic growth within the Safety Services segment. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.4%, with the company reaffirming its commitment to achieving a 13% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025. Despite project delays impacting revenues by approximately $150 million, APG remains optimistic about sustained growth and margin improvement. The company also reported an adjusted gross margin rise to 31% and a 9% year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS, reaching $0.51. Overall APG ranks 10th on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of APG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stands against the other AI stocks. Wall Street's major indexes closed lower on Monday, December 9th, dragged down by a decline in Nvidia. The plunge pressured the broader technology sector, with investors also turning their attention to an important inflation report due this week. READ NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Investors expect the consumer price index (CPI) data set to be released on Wednesday, while the producer price index (PPI) is anticipated on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18. The plunge, however, seems only temporary, and technology stocks are poised to gain in the future. BlackRock anticipates that infrastructure and cybersecurity investments will "shine" in 2025. Jay Jacobs, the firm’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, considers the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. Jacobs said that AI companies need to build out their data centers and that keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the New Year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable. We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” Jacobs further stated that even though technology may seem tangible, it is also heavily reliant on physical infrastructure such as energy, materials like copper, and even real estate. These real-world components are essential for supporting the systems that are used every day. He further went on to say that it’s not just the mega-cap tech names that are winning, other semiconductor companies and other data center companies are benefiting from the rise of this theme. In this regard, AI ETFs can play a significant role in helping investors gain targeted exposure while mitigating some of the risks associated with investing in individual AI stocks. They are a smart way for investors to invest in a theme for seeking longer-term gains. “Identifying future winners can be very difficult – it’s not always the obvious names that make it in the long-term”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Jay Jacobs, the firm’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, considers the artificial intelligence boom as a major catalyst. Jacobs said that AI companies need to build out their data centers and that keeping that data safe is also a sound investment play for the New Year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable. We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” Jacobs further stated that even though technology may seem tangible, it is also heavily reliant on physical infrastructure such as energy, materials like copper, and even real estate. These real-world components are essential for supporting the systems that are used every day. He further went on to say that it’s not just the mega-cap tech names that are winning, other semiconductor companies and other data center companies are benefiting from the rise of this theme. In this regard, AI ETFs can play a significant role in helping investors gain targeted exposure while mitigating some of the risks associated with investing in individual AI stocks. They are a smart way for investors to invest in a theme for seeking longer-term gains. “Identifying future winners can be very difficult – it’s not always the obvious names that make it in the long-term”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A team of IT professionals meticulously crafting a large-scale enterprise performance management system. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91 Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a database management and cloud service provider hosting immense data that AI applications need to process. On December 9, the company posted its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results with slight revenue and profit miss due to tough competition among database and cloud services providers. The company earned an adjusted $1.47 per share, with revenues rising 8.6% year-over-year to reach $14.1B. Meanwhile, analysts expected the company to earn an adjusted $1.48 per share on $14.12B in revenue. Cloud revenue, including infrastructure and applications, totaled $5.9 billion, slightly under the $6 billion estimate. Meanwhile, infrastructure revenue surged by 52% year-over-year, reaching $2.4 billion, and application revenue increased by 10% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. "Record level AI demand drove Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue up 52% in Q2, a much higher growth rate than any of our hyperscale cloud infrastructure competitors. Growth in the AI segment of our Infrastructure business was extraordinary—GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter—and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI SuperComputer scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs. With our remaining performance obligation up 50% to $97 billion, we believe our already impressive growth rates will continue to climb even higher. This fiscal year, total Oracle Cloud revenue should top $25 billion." Overall ORCL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How is it we know more about Luigi Mangione than we do about Thomas Crooks?
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2024/12/how_is_it_we_know_more_about_luigi_mangione_than_we_do_about_thomas_crooks.html
Time Published: 2024-12-11T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Within hours of his apprehension in Pennsylvania in connection with the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, scads of information rolled out about the life and times of suspect Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man who has been accused of the killing, and in a very short period of time, the Internet being a fast medium. We've seen pictures of his family, and heard their statements of shock and regret at the news. We learned he grew up wealthy, the son of the owner of two resorts near Baltimore. We learned he once worked in a nursing home owned by his family. We learned where he went to school, even high school where he was a valedictorian, and that he was quite accomplished in the difficult subjects of computer science and engineering at an Ivy League university. We've heard from his friends, who say he was normal and outgoing, with some even seeing leadership qualities in him. We learned he was athletic and outdoorsy, enjoying hiking and surfing. We learned he was well traveled, living as a digital nomad in Hawaii, traveling to Japan, living in San Francisco, as well as Pennsylvania and Maryland in his life earlier. We learned about his online presence through his many social media accounts, posting pictures of his ripped physique, liking the Unabomber, disliking Jordan Peterson, getting into deep philosophical discussions with others. We learned about his surfing accident which led to back surgery, leaving him with four pins in his back, apparent pictures of which he posted on his social media bannerheads. We even learned that, according to a friend, that the surgery made it too painful for him to have sexual relations ever again, which he resented. We learned of his obsessive dislike for the health insurance industry -- and can only recall that involuntary eunuchs have been known to take revenge on their tormentors. We learned about his manifesto which was picked up by the cops when they apprehended him, and it seems to have been leaked already into the Internet, railing against the health care industry. So there's quite a lot of information out there, and this synopsis is far from complete. That, in addition to the details of the murder and the details of the apprehension, presents a pretty comprehensive picture. It's in striking contrast to the last high-profile killer who came to our attention last July, Thomas Crooks, another young man with a similar background who got his name in the news for attempting to kill President Trump amid a sea of Secret Service incompetence, but did manage to murder an innocent firefighter who was nearby, and injure two others in addition to President Trump, before he was shot dead by a cop. His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack. We know nothing about the strange ad he made for Blackrock, or the 18 burner phones in his backpack. We don't know who he was talking to on the phone, seen in a video, before he launched into his assassination bid. If he had a manifesto, we haven't seen it. And his social media accounts were quickly scrubbed and shut down. Now, some of this can be explained away by Mangione having an internet presence and being a non-misfit socially, which made more information available generally. But that doesn't explain all of it. Where are the classmates who knew him? Why is his family so silent? Why has his social media presence been suppressed? And why is the Secret Service seemingly going out of its way to obstruct Congress? There have been quite a few shouting matches at this point. Even less information is available about a second apparent wannabe-assassin of Trump in Florida a few weeks later, accused gunman Ryan Routh.We know he was a loser of some kind, having no money and living in a shambling house in Hawaii (as Mangione did). We don't know how he got a lot of money to travel around trailing Trump from North Carolina to Florida. There is some information about his inchoate political views, which like everything else about him, is fragmented. The guess one can make for this assymetrical distribution of information is that the press and the government investigating the assassination attempts hates Trump, and may even be implicated in the assasination attempts, as if in a coverup. By contrast, most people are pretty appalled about the cold-blooded murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York. That may explain why so little information about the attempts on Trump are out there in contrast to Mangione. They'd rather sweep it under the rug. It's hard to say with certainly what this is about, but it's just strange that some information gets out more readily about major events than others. Funny how it's the information we want most.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best American Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) stands against the other American dividend stocks. The US economy expanded by 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, as reported in the Advance GDP release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the ninth straight quarter of growth in real GDP. While the third-quarter increase was robust, it slightly lagged behind the 3% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated a 3.1% rise. Regardless of market conditions, investors frequently seek to minimize risk in their portfolios, and investing in dividend stocks is a reliable approach to achieve this. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the growing significance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over time, dividend income has steadily risen, increasing from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, interest income has seen a decline, dropping from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by over 10% since the start of 2024, underperforming the market. Although dividend stocks may not have been hitting it out of the park this year, US companies have remained dedicated to rewarding shareholders by consistently paying dividends. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones, for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, US common dividend increases totaled $74.7 billion, marking a 16.9% rise from the $63.9 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier, ending in September 2023. The report also mentioned that in the third quarter of 2024, there were 480 dividend increases reported, marking a 7.1% rise compared to the 448 increases in the same period in 2023. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $14.1 billion for the quarter. WisdomTree offers an interesting perspective on global dividends in its report. According to their findings, the global equity market currently distributes around $1.6 trillion in dividends, an increase from approximately $1.5 trillion last year. Notably, 55% of these dividends come from outside the US, which is about 15% more than the non-US share in market cap-weighted indexes. On the other hand, US companies account for 44% of global dividends, which is considerably less than their 63% share of global market capitalization. This suggests that non-US markets are more heavily weighted in dividend-focused indexes, while US exposure is relatively lower. For instance, European countries make up about a quarter of global dividend payments, which is 10% more than their share of the global market cap. That said, the start of dividend payments by several major US tech companies contributed an additional 1.1 percentage points to the global growth rate in Q2, as reported by Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index report. The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A home improvement store overflowing with a variety of products and supplies. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is an American multinational home improvement retail company that sells appliances, tools, construction equipment, and related products. The company faced challenges this year due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty, which dampened overall consumer demand and led to reduced spending on home improvement projects. In its latest quarter, it reported a 1.3% decline in same-store sales compared to the previous year—an unfavorable outcome for any retail-focused business. Management anticipates this downward trend will persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. That said, the stock has surged by over 22.4% since the start of 2024. This was also highlighted by Carillon Tower Advisers in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “While Home Depot, Inc.’s (NYSE:HD) recent reported earnings were somewhat tepid, the market seems to be pricing in an inversion of the company’s sales, driven by lower interest rates. Home Depot reported its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, giving back substantial gains that it enjoyed during the pandemic. High mortgage rates have also put a damper on existing home sales. People typically spend the most on home repairs and improvements in years when they buy or sell houses, often conducting both transactions in the same year.” In the third quarter of 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) reported revenue of $40.22 billion, which showed a 6.6% growth from the same period last year. The company's operating income came in at $5.4 billion and its operating margin was 13.5%. It experienced improved customer interest in seasonal products and various outdoor projects, along with additional sales driven by demand related to hurricane activity. In the first nine months of the year, The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) generated over $15 billion in operating cash flow. The company's strong cash position makes it a generous dividend payer. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $2.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.13%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has raised its payouts for 14 consecutive years. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 82 hedge funds owned stakes in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), down from 86 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $7.6 billion in total. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company. Overall HD ranks 3rd on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for HD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:PFE) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotech company. Its recent success, driven by its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment pill, has left some investors viewing it as a stock past its prime. With demand for the vaccine declining sharply, concerns have emerged about possible shifts in vaccine policy under the incoming Trump administration, adding to investor apprehensions. Since the start of 2024, the stock has fallen by over 13%. That said, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported strong earnings in the most recent quarter. The company posted revenue of $17.7 billion, which showed a significant 32% growth from the same period last year. It sustained remarkable growth in its Oncology portfolio, with significant revenue contributions from products such as Padcev, Xtandi, Lorbrena, and Braftovi/Mektovi. Additionally, it successfully met increased demand for Paxlovid during the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. In the first nine months of 2024, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) returned $7.1 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company's quarterly dividend comes in at $0.42 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 6.51%, as of December 10. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for 14 consecutive years. Parnassus Investments highlighted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “During the quarter, we added new positions in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), NICE and Charter Communications. We purchased Pfizer to capture the potential upside from any turnaround following the COVID-induced boom-bust cycle of the last few years. Pfizer’s stock price sank by more than 40% in 2023 as COVID-19 vaccine revenues rolled off, providing an attractive entry point for us.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best American Dividend Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other American dividend stocks. The US economy expanded by 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, as reported in the Advance GDP release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the ninth straight quarter of growth in real GDP. While the third-quarter increase was robust, it slightly lagged behind the 3% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Economists polled by Dow Jones had anticipated a 3.1% rise. Regardless of market conditions, investors frequently seek to minimize risk in their portfolios, and investing in dividend stocks is a reliable approach to achieve this. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the growing significance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over time, dividend income has steadily risen, increasing from 2.68% in the fourth quarter of 1980 to 7.88% in the second quarter of 2024. In contrast, interest income has seen a decline, dropping from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by over 10% since the start of 2024, underperforming the market. Although dividend stocks may not have been hitting it out of the park this year, US companies have remained dedicated to rewarding shareholders by consistently paying dividends. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones, for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, US common dividend increases totaled $74.7 billion, marking a 16.9% rise from the $63.9 billion recorded in the same period a year earlier, ending in September 2023. The report also mentioned that in the third quarter of 2024, there were 480 dividend increases reported, marking a 7.1% rise compared to the 448 increases in the same period in 2023. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $14.1 billion for the quarter. WisdomTree offers an interesting perspective on global dividends in its report. According to their findings, the global equity market currently distributes around $1.6 trillion in dividends, an increase from approximately $1.5 trillion last year. Notably, 55% of these dividends come from outside the US, which is about 15% more than the non-US share in market cap-weighted indexes. On the other hand, US companies account for 44% of global dividends, which is considerably less than their 63% share of global market capitalization. This suggests that non-US markets are more heavily weighted in dividend-focused indexes, while US exposure is relatively lower. For instance, European countries make up about a quarter of global dividend payments, which is 10% more than their share of the global market cap. That said, the start of dividend payments by several major US tech companies contributed an additional 1.1 percentage points to the global growth rate in Q2, as reported by Janus Henderson’s Global Dividend Index report. The report also mentioned that the contribution from these new dividend payers will persist throughout the remainder of the year, ensuring that US payout growth remains ahead of the global average. In view of this, let’s take a look at some of the best American dividend stocks. Our Methodology: We created this list by scanning Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database for US companies that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 10 years and are traded on American stock exchanges. Then, we chose stocks with dividend yields above 2% as of December 10. Finally, we selected the top 8 companies with the most hedge fund investors in Q3 2024 from the refined dataset. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American multinational telecommunications company that offers a wide range of related services and products to its consumers. The stock is down by over 11% since the start of 2024. The company's performance has been lackluster, as investors have found little motivation to invest in it this year. Despite reporting solid earnings in the latest quarter, the results failed to captivate investors, as they were viewed as merely a temporary improvement rather than a long-term growth indicator. In the third quarter of 2024, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported revenue of $32.07 billion, which grew by 7% from the same period last year. The company's performance highlighted its strength, with broadband ARPU rising by 3.6%. Its connectivity business also grew by 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for Connectivity & Platforms reached 40.9%. Additionally, the company successfully delivered the Paris Summer Olympics, driving double-digit growth in Peacock revenue and paid subscribers, while also securing NBC's position as the top network for the 2023-2024 season. From a dividend point of view, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) held a steady cash position. In the most recent quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow and its free cash flow came in at more than $3.4 billion. In addition, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, which makes CMCSA one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.20%, as of December 10. The company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 16 years. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) jumped to 72 in Q3 2024, from 61 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of more than $5.44 billion. With over 31.8 million shares, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall CMCSA ranks 8th on our list of the best American dividend stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential for CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Among the Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stands against the other cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks. In the face of economic uncertainty, consumer preferences in the beauty industry are changing. A Bloomberg Intelligence poll conducted in June 2024 with 650 participants found that 40% of respondents gave beauty and personal care purchases more importance than other products. Nonetheless, this represents the lowest result since the survey's launch two years ago, a 10-percentage-point drop from January. Despite the continued success of premium cosmetic products, there is less demand for mainstream, reasonably priced products, which make up the majority of the market. Leonard Lauder's "Lipstick Index" theory, which associates economic slowdowns with increased spending on self-care, seems less sound these days. Although the beauty industry has grown significantly over the last five years, Andrea Felsted, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, observes that customer interests are beginning to shift. This drop in affordable beauty purchases raises questions about how well the industry can withstand economic downturns. The results point to changing customer behavior, with high-end products performing better and less expensive markets being squeezed during difficult economic conditions. Amidst this shift, according to Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell, younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are more willing to spend money on beauty than previous generations, especially on skincare or as a way to express themselves. He also mentioned that a growing percentage of Americans are Hispanic consumers, who are more likely to be active in the area. Here are some comments from Kimbell: “While we anticipate that some of these headwinds will persist in the near term, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and set ourselves up for long-term growth.” Meanwhile, the market for medical aesthetics, or procedures meant to enhance patients' physical attractiveness, is expected to grow in the future. According to research by senior partner Olivier Leclerc and colleagues, the CAGR for neuromodulators like Botox is anticipated to reach 11.9 percent in the US and Canada by 2025. By 2025, the compound annual growth rate for injectable dermal fillers, such as biostimulators and hyaluronic acid fillers, may reach 3.8 percent. Moreover, as per McKinsey's research report, through 2025, the medical aesthetics industry is expected to continue growing at a rate close to double digits. In one of the recent developments, finance solutions like "buy-now, pay-later" loans are being given to make cosmetic procedures more affordable because of the rising demand for these procedures in the United States, as reported by Bloomberg. While the demand spike from the pandemic has subsided, rates of aesthetic procedures are still substantially higher than they were before COVID, with a 2023 increase over 2024, according to a June 2024 study from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Financing programs that divide expenses ranging from $200 to $10,000 into smaller installments over three to sixty months are now advantageous for facial procedures and other treatments. These choices are especially appealing to younger consumers because they frequently include interest-free terms and low credit requirements. According to Bloomberg, sales of asset-backed securities in the United States have increased by almost 20% year over year, reflecting this trend in the larger financial market. This highlights the connection between high customer demand and innovative financial solutions. In this article, we first used a stock screener, to list down all Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks (as of the writing of this article) with the highest institutional ownership. From the resultant dataset, we chose 11 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here) A smiling baby with an array of baby care products in the foreground. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81 The multinational healthcare firm Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), through its subsidiary MENTOR, specializes in breast reconstruction and aesthetics. For use in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery treatments, the company offers breast implants, tissue expanders, and other surgical materials. Mentor's Breast Implant Simulator app allows users to submit images or use real-time video to model implant sizes. It uses augmented reality to display breast augmentation outcomes. It also provides educational content, connects users to nearby surgeons, and makes it easier to share discoveries for feedback. Revenue increased by 5.25% YoY to $22.47 billion in the third quarter of 2024, with Innovative Medicine leading the way with a 4.9% YoY growth to $14.58 billion. Moreover, the MedTech division, which encompasses aesthetics, reported a 6.4% increase in operational sales in the third quarter of 2024. Acquisitions such as Abiomed had a favorable effect on this division. The firm produced $14 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of this year, compared to $11.9 billion in the same period last year. For the past 62 years, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has consistently increased its dividends. The current quarterly dividend paid by the firm is $1.62 per share. An analyst at Wolfe Research named Alexandria Hammond began covering Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a $190 price target and an Outperform rating. Beyond Mounjaro/Zepbound from Lilly (LLY), the firm anticipates growth names and/or "dream the dream" names to win in 2025. J&J's Pharma growth drivers, including JNJ-2113, Tremfya, nipocalimab, Carvykti, and Drazalex Faspro, are viewed as "best-in-class" by the firm. Moreover, Wolfe predicts that J&J's revenue would increase by at least 3% despite Stelara's loss of exclusivity challenges. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns 7,560,199 shares worth $1.23 billion as of Q3. Overall JNJ ranks 1st on our list of the best cosmetic surgery and aesthetics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential for JNJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bitcoin LTHs cash out at 326% gains: Can new demand keep BTC stable?

Long-term Bitcoin holders are cashing out amid a rally, while new investors help absorb supply. As Bitcoin’s [BTC] price continues its impressive rally, long-term holders are seizing the opportunity to cash out, realizing gains of approximately 326% on their investments with an average entry price of $23.4K. This surge in profit-taking has added selling pressure to the market, yet BTC has demonstrated remarkable resilience, absorbing the increased supply. But what’s driving these LTHs to sell now? And how are new investors stepping in to sustain the market’s upward momentum? Long-term BTC holders are capitalizing on the current rally, realizing an average 326% profit with an entry cost of $23.4K. This behavior aligns with historical patterns where significant price surges often trigger profit-taking. However, this wave of selling appears more strategic than reactive. With BTC trading well above the LTH cost basis, many are opting to de-risk amidst macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential interest rate shifts and market liquidity concerns. Source: X Additionally, the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s halving events may play a role, with some LTHs anticipating a plateau or temporary downturn. Despite this selling pressure, Bitcoin’s resilience – buoyed by strong demand from newer market entrants – shows a robust redistribution phase rather than an alarming sell-off. This shift in market dynamics could redefine BTC’s near-term trajectory. The recent surge in BTC’s price reflects a shift where demand, rather than just supply constraints, is driving its growth. New investors, particularly those leveraging institutional-grade financial instruments like Bitcoin ETFs, have played a pivotal role in absorbing the available supply. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock amassed $10 billion in assets under management within seven weeks, accounting for over 40% of spot ETF volumes. This rapid adoption has spurred projections that Bitcoin ETFs might surpass gold ETFs in total assets in the near future. With ETFs now channeling 75% of new Bitcoin investments, their influence could grow even further, especially as the halving event heightened scarcity. Anticipation of reduced supply coupled with increasing demand positions new investors as key drivers of Bitcoin’s price momentum​. As Bitcoin navigates heightened selling pressure from long-term holders, the road ahead appears shaped by crucial developments. The halving event has tightened BTC supply, boosting scarcity premiums. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Institutional interest, especially through spot Bitcoin ETFs, may stabilize demand and promote adoption. However, regulatory clarity remains crucial for BTC’s mainstream recognition. Bitcoin’s growing link to macroeconomic trends and traditional assets positions it as both speculative and maturing. Its ability to sustain growth or navigate volatility depends on balancing innovation, adoption, and the ongoing tension between scarcity and liquidity.

The product range includes both in-house and third-party brands, covering three key categories -- apparel, general merchandise, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Report by KS Badri Narayanan of businessline | Read here Leader with strong moats in a growing industry - Emkay Global Research Vishal Mega Mart (VMML) caters to a large and fast-growing TAM (USD430bn; ~10% CAGR), by affordably addressing aspirations of the middle-/lower-income India. Variety and Affordability are key moats, as VMML is a one-stop-shop for Apparel/FMCG/General Merchandise categories, and offers the best affordability with high share of own brands (~72%). VMML aspires to continue delivering strong double-digit growth, mainly helped by low-teen SSG trends and partly via store additions. VMML expects to see retail space CAGR of ~10%, as it currently caters to ~400 cities vs a huge potential of ~1,300 cities (with population above 50K). VMML also has potential to go deeper in existing cities. High store-throughput and lower WC needs ensure best-in-class payback (18-20 months) and generate sufficient cash-flows for pursuing growth. IPO of Rs80bn is entirely OFS, with post-IPO market cap of Rs352bn. Key risks: Supply overhang on big PE ownership and potential ESOP dilution (4-5%). Vishal Mega Mart is all set to launch its ₹8,000 crore IPO today for public at a price band of ₹74-78. The IPO will close on December 13 and the market lot is 190 shares.

Title: Is AppLovin Corporation (APP) Among the Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applovin-corporation-app-among-best-024932001.html
Time Published: 2024-12-11T02:49:32Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks. For a large portion of investors who put money in the market, growth is the primary objective. The stocks that these investors prefer are also stocks that are either currently exhibiting strong revenue growth or have product strengths or other competitive advantages that can ensure that they will dominate their markets and grow in the future. Broadly speaking, it is possible to identify such stocks by looking at which industries are expected to grow strongly. A few years ago, semiconductor design and fabrication was one such sector. Back then, the world's largest integrated chip manufacturer known for its Core processor lineup had started to struggle. The nature of the semiconductor industry which requires years of research expertise and billions of dollars in capital expenditure meant that the market was not only open to new players but also that this opening favored incumbents that already had the necessary investments and expertise in place. This gap led to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the firm which ranked 3rd on our list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket to touch astronomically high levels as soon as the firm started to turn a profit. As an illustration, consider the P/E ratio of this stock at Q1 2018's close. The ratio back then was 111, while the integrated chip manufacturer was trading at 19 and the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer which ranks 2nd on our list of 10 Best Tech Stocks For Long-Term Investment traded at 16.11. During the same period, Wall Street's favorite AI GPU stock whose shares have gained 700%+ since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT was trading at a P/E ratio of 37. Naturally, this indicated that investors were betting heavily on the firm to grow. Since 2018's first quarter, its shares have gained a whopping 1,204% while the GPU company has gained 2,175% and the integrated chip manufacturer is down by 57.6%. Between its fiscal years 2017 to the latest trailing-twelve-month revenue, the growth stock that traded at a P/E ratio of 111 in 2018 has grown revenue by 358%, so it's safe to say that in this case, growth investors were right, and their investments if dearly held since then have outpaced the firm's revenue in growth terms. Therein lies the magic of growth stocks, which can generate substantial returns for investors. However, as is the case with all things in life, this promise also comes with a dark side. Research from the University of Michigan shows that growth stocks are punished harder than value stocks in case of negative earnings surprises. For their research, the researchers analyzed consensus earnings forecasts, quarterly share prices, stock prices, P/E ratios, and other variables for 13 years to determine the returns of growth and value stocks that missed or beat analyst earnings estimates. By bifurcating their results across five categories starting from Low Growth and ending at High Growth, they demonstrate a clear difference between the post-earnings stock returns of growth and non-growth stocks. For the Low Growth stocks, a negative earnings surprise led to -3.57% in share price returns starting two days following the report and ending before the next report. The High Growth stocks led the Low Growth stocks by 3.75 percentage points in negative returns as they lost 7.32% over the same period after posting a negative earnings surprise. The 3.75 percentage point differential is key when we analyze these two categories' stock price performance after positive earnings surprises. This is because while the Low Growth stocks gained 5.44% after the earnings surprise, the High Growth stocks led them by only 0.88 percentage points by gaining 6.32%. Similarly, not only are growth stocks punished harder if they miss investor expectations, but the share price drops can make earlier optimism regarding their fortunes appear misplaced as well. The best example of this fact is the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. SaaS firms were the pinnacle of growth investing because of their business model which allows them to earn recurring revenue through sizable contracts while keeping costs low. Investor optimism surrounding SaaS stock touched a feverish pitch in Q1 2021 when their median EV/Revenue multiple sat at 14.1x. This meant that the firms' market capitalization and debt minus cash and other assets were valued 14 times their sales. But, by Q4 2022 this had dropped to 4.6x as a combination of factors such as higher rates leading to tighter business spending and the pivot towards artificial intelligence soured sentiment. SaaS firms were particularly hurt since AI enables businesses to self-develop software which reduces the need for SaaS products and services. So, with the landscape surrounding growth stocks being as dynamic as their share prices, we decided to look at some aggressive growth stocks with high revenue growth and significant hedge fund interest. Our Methodology To compile our list of the best aggressive growth stocks, we first sifted out 12 stocks with annual latest quarter revenue growth greater than 35% from multiple growth ETFs. The stocks were then ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a mobile device, showing an advertiser reaching out to a consumer via a software-based platform. Revenue Growth: 38.6% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 51 AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company that works with video game companies to enable them to run advertisements, analytics, and other associated operations. It is one of the best-performing stocks of 2024 as the shares are up an unbelievable 935% year-to-date. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is also a diversified company as it owns and runs more than 200 video games in a market where the internet and digital entertainment mediums reign supreme. The firm benefited from a blowout third-quarter earnings report in November which sent its shares surging by a stunning 33% in aftermarket trading. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP)'s $1.2 billion in revenue marked a 38.6% annual growth and beat analyst estimates of $1.12 billion. Its median guidance of $1.25 billion for fourth-quarter revenue also beat analyst estimates of $1.17 billion by a comfortable $800 million. Looking ahead, AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) could benefit from expanding into tertiary markets such as connected televisions to add more juice to its stock. SaltLight Capital mentioned AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “This quarter, our notable contributors included AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP). We start with the current state of the “hit” title-driven market. These dynamics are not new, so many studios have transitioned to free-to-play games (FTP). We then talk about AppLovin, which is at the nexus of making this traditional market successful. Overall APP ranks 4th on our list of the aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He Likes Adobe Inc. (ADBE) ‘Very Much’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-likes-adobe-003235319.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the rise of Bitcoin and expressed his admiration for the digital currency’s growth. However, he was careful to emphasize that Bitcoin should not replace traditional investments, particularly stocks, but rather should complement them in a diversified portfolio. “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really I do, not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not bury it.” Cramer recalled the moment when President-elect Donald Trump began giving importance to cryptocurrency during his administration. On July 27, Trump declared that the U.S. government would fully embrace Bitcoin if he won the election. At the time, Bitcoin was valued just under $70,000. Cramer also noted Trump’s promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and make America the global leader in cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted Trump’s statement, “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Regardless of whether one agrees with the policy, Cramer remarked, Trump’s words were a clear signal of how beneficial the growing popularity of cryptocurrency could be for its owners. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan This Week: 10 Stocks to Watch Cramer then shared insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold. He went on to say: “I've always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world's lunacy. But for years now, I've also been saying Bitcoin's a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don't want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer also acknowledged that some people might have gone all-in on Bitcoin and praised their decision. However, he recommended balancing Bitcoin investments with stocks. For instance, if Trump were to make a move to encourage buying Tesla, Cramer commented, having both stocks and crypto would give investors an edge. “While we could become the bitcoin network, especially since President-elect Trump christened us as the bitcoin nation, I actually think there’s more to investing than just owning cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin's part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history. Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 29 stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired over the last 2 weeks. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of December 9. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of engineers and scientists collaborating at a workstation surrounded by their applications and solutions. Average Price Target Upside: 13.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 123 Cramer commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) before it reports its Q4 and FY2024 earnings on December 11, saying: “As I mentioned earlier, the enterprise software stocks have been roaring, reacting very positively to pretty much everything these days. So maybe we should start thinking about buying the stock of Adobe, which has some of the very best software to help businesses with marketing and web design. I like this company very much, but it's been stuck in enterprise software purgatory. Not anymore. Maybe it has a real run by just delivering good numbers.” Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a prominent software company known for offering a wide range of products and services, particularly in digital media creation and document management. Recently, the company has made significant strides in integrating AI into its products. During its third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted how the integration of AI, particularly in generative features, into its core products has led to higher customer retention, as users tend to stick with the tools that incorporate these advanced capabilities. The company projects its total revenue for the fourth quarter to fall between $5.50 billion and $5.55 billion. It expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.63 to $4.68.

Title: Why Marvell Technology (MRVL) Is Winning Big in the AI and Cloud Revolution

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An assembly line in a semiconductor factory, with workers at their stations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor firm with a significant focus on data centers. The company was awarded a “Buy” rating on December 4 by DBS analyst Fang Boon Foo, having reiterated its bullish stance on the stock. Marvell Technology has been thriving in the data center market, with revenues surpassing expectations that are driven by a strong demand for its AI technologies. The company makes custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google, Amazon and Microsoft. The company’s leadership in communications and connectivity, reinforced by key growth areas such as data infrastructure, cloud, and 5G, underpins its market advantage. Moreover, its shift from consumer products achieved through strategic acquisitions like Innovium, Inphi, and Aquantia, demonstrates its commitment towards stable enterprise solutions. Lastly, expected growth in return on equity and a recovery in non-AI segments support a positive outlook despite past challenges. Overall, MRVL ranks 5th on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRVL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Goldstein pointed to particular opportunities in AI. "In this world of artificial intelligence, I think there's a lot more you can do with regard to not only data, but importantly automating a lot of processes," Goldstein said. BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, which struck nearly $30 billion in acquisitions this year.

Title: BlackRock sees investor shift from cash after even 'modest' rate cuts
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/blackrock-sees-investor-shift-from-cash-after-even-modest-rate-cuts-3765150
Time Published: 2024-12-10T23:28:56Z

By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are expected to increase their allocations to stocks and bonds from cash after even "modest" Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief financial officer said on Tuesday. Expectations earlier this year that the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates aggressively after hiking them to fight inflation have moderated in recent months as the U.S. economy continues to show momentum despite high borrowing costs. "I think even modest rate cuts are going to fuel a very healthy amount of investor re-risking," said BlackRock CFO Martin Small, speaking at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services conference on Tuesday. Lower interest rates are expected to eventually pull yields in money markets down from well above 4%, which is where cash-like instruments like T-bills currently stand. So far, however, there has been little evidence that investors are abandoning cash. Assets in U.S. money markets stood at $6.77 trillion as of last week, data from the Investment Company Institute showed, up from $6.3 trillion in early September. "There's still enough political and economic uncertainty in the world that cash is an attractive safe haven for clients," Small said. "Market expectations for rate cuts ... are shallower and fewer," he said, adding that these and other factors had made money market fund balances stickier. The U.S. central bank started cutting interest rates in September by 50 basis points. That was followed by another 25 basis point cut last month, with investors now betting on an additional quarter of a percentage point cut later this month. After that, further easing is largely expected to depend on economic data as well as the path of inflation. Investors now expect interest rates of about 3.7% by the end of next year, which would be about 90 basis points higher than what was priced in September. Still, Small said investors that favor cash were underperforming traditional investment portfolios that blended equities and bonds. "That fear of missing out ... is contributing meaningfully to re-risking," he said. BlackRock's fixed-income products such as bond exchange-traded funds had seen strong inflows this year, he added. "It's not the floodgates ... but we've definitely seen more normalized allocations legging into fixed income," he said.

He Lifeng is one of China's four vice premiers, and heads the ruling Chinese Communist Party's economic and finance committee. He met with BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink in Beijing on Dec. 5, and Goldman Sachs President and COO John E. Waldron on Dec. 4, according to state media. That followed a meeting with Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser on Nov. 21, state media said. "The Chinese are seeking all possible avenues to access those now ascending to power in Washington. The Trump Team," said Peter Alexander, founder of Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. "Back channeling is how China operates, even prefers, when building lines of communications." Goldman Sachs said it was aware of the reports. The two other financial firms did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. Trump has filled his Cabinet picks with at least 10 reported billionaires, including two with a finance-heavy background: hedge fund manager Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for Commerce secretary. "I do think the Wall Street folks that are coming into commerce and treasury will serve a moderating role on the trade protectionist side," said Clark Packard, research fellow at the Cato Institute. "It's all relative because I do think there's going to be something protectionist on the trade side. Those voices will be the voices that work to mitigate some of that." "Especially at Treasury they're pretty worried about market reaction," Packard said. "The one thing that can truly maybe scare Trump away from a really aggressive [policy] would be the market reaction." U.S. stocks are on track for a relatively rare second straight year of more than 20% gains. After tumbling early this year, Chinese stocks rebounded after Beijing signaled a shift toward stimulus in late September. Chinese authorities on Monday affirmed that supportive stance in a high-level meeting. With actions such as hosting Wall Street executives and imposing export controls on critical minerals, Beijing is keeping its options open, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, who is Maurice R. Greenberg senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "They are preparing for the worst-case scenario." But she cautioned that it's unlikely that financial institutions can do much to mitigate tariffs and tensions with the U.S. "Business transactions and Wall Street executives, one way or another, they would not give up opportunities in any market as long as it fits into their profile," Liu said. Chinese financial media summarized He Lifeng's meetings with the U.S. executives as sending a signal on Beijing's willingness to open up the financial sector and attract long-term, foreign institutional investment. Foreign capital inflows are often cast by Chinese state media as a symbol of support for the domestic market. The Chinese vice premier also met with Invesco President and CEO Andrew Schlossberg in Beijing on Nov. 12, and HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker on Nov. 14, according to state media. HSBC said it had nothing to add to the report. Invesco did not respond to a request for comment. U.S.-China capital markets have been "arguably the most dynamic and inter-connected aspect" of the bilateral relationship in the last two decades, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. "When the cross-border finance relationship is constructive and cooperative, it could lead to MAP, i.e. mutual assured [prosperity]; otherwise it will be MAD, mutual assured destruction," Ma said, referring to a Cold War deterrence principle.

Title: Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Declining Again Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares continued to slide on Tuesday, falling more than 3% after a Chinese regulator announced that it was investigating the chipmaker for possible violations of the country’s antimonopoly law. On Monday, December 9, the Chinese government announced that The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) had initiated an investigation concerning Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox and some agreements made during the acquisition. Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020 required approval from Chinese antitrust regulators given their substantial operations in China. The country’s competition authority approved the $7 billion acquisition on the condition that competitors be informed of any new Mellanox products within 90 days of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) gaining access to them. The current investigation aims to highlight whether Nvidia complied with this requirement or failed to do so. South China Morning Post reveals that (AI) chip giant Nvidia could face a fine of up to US$1 billion under Beijing’s antitrust probe. The move, considered retaliation against Washington’s chip restrictions, marks the first time that China’s market regulator has opened the books on a closed deal. As per China’s antitrust law, companies violating antitrust regulations could face fines ranging from 1 to 10 percent of their annual sales from the previous year. However, it does not specify whether this applies to global or China sales. China, including Hong Kong, is Nvidia’s third-largest market by revenue, with sales reaching US$10.3 billion for the financial year ended January 24 (nearly 17 percent of its total revenue). However, it is too early to determine the exact amount of the fine Nvidia could be facing. “Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them. We work hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honour our commitments everywhere we do business. We are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”- Nvidia said in a statement issued in response to the probe. The leading AI chipmaker slid despite a key sales boost from supplier TSMC. While TSMC's strong sales highlight robust demand for Nvidia's GPUs and AI chips, investor sentiment was likely overshadowed by the ongoing antitrust probe. Nvidia’s continued slide today may also have been due to traders opting to sell an “earlier pop”. Historically, December hasn’t been kind to Nvidia either. According to Benzinga, the semiconductor giant often comes into a temporary bearish phase following its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's performance through November is typically strong, creating a favorable environment for year-end profit-taking. This move to secure profits before year-end creates a downward pressure. Nevertheless, December declines like these are likely to be temporary, with the stock likely to rebound in the first quarter, as it has done so previously. Our research director shared his views on NVDA’s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on Coterra Energy Inc. (CTRA): ‘Shrewdest Operators In The Industry’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed the rise of Bitcoin and expressed his admiration for the digital currency’s growth. However, he was careful to emphasize that Bitcoin should not replace traditional investments, particularly stocks, but rather should complement them in a diversified portfolio. “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really I do, not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not bury it.” Cramer recalled the moment when President-elect Donald Trump began giving importance to cryptocurrency during his administration. On July 27, Trump declared that the U.S. government would fully embrace Bitcoin if he won the election. At the time, Bitcoin was valued just under $70,000. Cramer also noted Trump’s promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and make America the global leader in cryptocurrency. Cramer highlighted Trump’s statement, “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA.” Regardless of whether one agrees with the policy, Cramer remarked, Trump’s words were a clear signal of how beneficial the growing popularity of cryptocurrency could be for its owners. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan This Week: 10 Stocks to Watch Cramer then shared insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that many investors see Bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold. He went on to say: “I've always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world's lunacy. But for years now, I've also been saying Bitcoin's a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don't want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer also acknowledged that some people might have gone all-in on Bitcoin and praised their decision. However, he recommended balancing Bitcoin investments with stocks. For instance, if Trump were to make a move to encourage buying Tesla, Cramer commented, having both stocks and crypto would give investors an edge. “While we could become the bitcoin network, especially since President-elect Trump christened us as the bitcoin nation, I actually think there’s more to investing than just owning cryptocurrencies… Bitcoin's part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history. Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 29 stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired over the last 2 weeks. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of December 9. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig pumping under the open sky of the Permian Basin. Average Price Target Upside: 31.26% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Cramer called Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) the “shrewdest operators in the industry” and said: “I still very much like Coterra Energy, currently the only energy holding in my Charitable Trust… This is another exploration production play, although it’s more balanced between oil and gas. In fact, after a pair of acquisitions announced earlier this month, Coterra’s revenue mix will tip a bit more in favor of oil. Next year, we like to say it’s more oily, less gassy. It does happen to have the lowest cost natural gas of any company in our country and that’s because of the legacy of the old Cabot Oil & Gas which created Coterra when it merged with Cimarex and rebranded the combined company. Coterra (NYSE:CTRA) is an independent oil and gas company involved in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. On December 5, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram raised the stock's price target to $31 from $29 and maintained an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm anticipates that natural gas producers will benefit from "three key secular demand trends" in 2025: the expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity, growing power demand due to electrification, and the shift from coal to gas. JPMorgan also updated its exploration and production models through 2030, supporting its view of long-term gas prices remaining above $3.50 per MMBtu. The firm believes prices must rise to encourage additional supply growth from the Haynesville and other higher-cost gas basins. Furthermore, JPMorgan expects the oil market to transition from balanced in 2024 to a surplus in 2025 due to increased supply, prompting a shift to a "more defensive stance." In Q3, Coterra (NYSE:CTRA) secured three long-term natural gas sales agreements, starting in 2027-2028, boosting its strategy with exposure to international LNG markets. In November, the company also announced $3.95 billion in acquisitions from Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources, expanding its presence in New Mexico and the Permian Basin. These acquisitions are expected to add 60,000 to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2025, with the deals closing in Q1 2025. Overall CTRA ranks 1st on our list of the best Jim Cramer stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CTRA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CTRA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The Texas Stock Exchange is getting ready to plant its flag in the Dallas real estate market. The upstart bourse backed by investors including BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities will open a temporary headquarters this spring at the Weir’s Plaza building, just north of downtown Dallas. The search is on for a permanent home, to be called the Texas Market Center, the company said in an emailed statement. Once built, the headquarters will house executive offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell as the the TXSE seeks to take on established markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A museum meant to showcase the history of modern business in Texas will also sit in the market center. The Dallas-Fort Worth area now has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York, as companies from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Charles Schwab Corp. expand operations. The TXSE is aiming to build on the state’s reputation for low taxes and a lighter regulatory touch, saying that companies that list on the market won’t need to meet environmental, social and governance thresholds beyond standard regulatory requirements. “The Texas Market Center will add to the vibrancy of Dallas’ thriving business community, and we believe it will drive further investment and corporate interest in the city and surrounding region,” James Lee, chief executive officer and founder of TXSE Group Inc., said in the statement. Texas has also increasingly lured corporations and financial firms from blue states such as New York and California. Texas is also developing a business-court system with an eye to handling more of the complex corporate litigation that Delaware is known for. The TXSE said earlier this year that it expects to handle its first trades in 2025 and host its first listing in 2026. The Texas venture is trying to muscle in on a business that consists of about 16 equities exchanges with widely varying trading volumes. Elsewhere in Dallas, the exchange plans to operate a data center to go with facilities in New Jersey and Chicago. Earlier this year, it hired executives from Charles Schwab, Nasdaq and the NYSE.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER) stands against other stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the outlook for the stock market following a year of strong gains, cautioning that investors’ overly optimistic expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead to trouble. As the year draws to a close, brokerages are releasing their official market predictions for 2025, and so far, they are almost universally positive. He said that this optimism is understandable given the strong earnings season and the significant stock market rally following the election. Cramer noted that many investors are betting that a business-friendly administration will continue to drive better returns. “See, after all these gains, you gotta get a little squeamish, don’t you? Unless something drastic happens in the next few weeks, we’re in line for our second straight year of 20% plus returns for the S&P 500. First time that’s happened since 1999, ooh, not the best precedent. Plus, the market’s gotten really expensive by historical standards.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch Cramer said that his main worry is that Wall Street may have gotten ahead of itself, with too many investors expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than are realistically likely. He highlighted the unusual situation that has unfolded since the Fed’s surprise double rate cut in September. While short-term interest rates have come down, long-term rates set by the bond market have actually risen, creating a stark contrast. He remarked: “The market’s betting on a December rate cut. Anything that derails that will be bad news for the averages.” When looking ahead to 2025, Cramer noted a significant lack of consensus about future rate cuts. He pointed to Fed funds futures for December 2025, which show a wide range of predicted outcomes. Investors are betting on anywhere from zero to eight rate cuts by then, with the most likely scenario being three cuts by the end of 2025. Cramer explained that while he thinks three rate cuts sound reasonable, it also suggests that roughly 41% of the market is anticipating too many cuts over the next year, a scenario that could disappoint many money managers. “So here’s the bottom line: Given all the success we’ve had in this market, we need to guard against complacency and that’s why I’m flagging my biggest worry that the market might be getting too aggressive with its expectations for rate cuts over the next year.” For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A scientist working in a modern lab, examining small-molecule and protein therapeutics. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8 During the lightning round, when a viewer asked Cramer about Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ:OMER), he said that it is possibly time to take some profit. “Well, it finally seems to have its day, but this weekend, there’s some big presentations at the thing called ASH… They’re going to make presentations, a lot of other companies, and it better be good after that run and I can’t be assured that it is good. Maybe it’s a little profit-taking time.” Omeros (NASDAQ:OMER) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for immunologic diseases, cancers, and addictive disorders, with key products in trials for various conditions. It should be noted that over the first nine months of 2024, the company’s net loss amounted to $125.5 million, or $2.15 per share, which is a deeper loss compared to the net loss of $108.8 million, or $1.73 per share, for the same period in the previous year. As of September 30, 2024, the company had $123.2 million in cash and short-term investments, marking a decrease of $48.7 million from the end of 2023. These funds are being used for ongoing operations and debt obligations. The company recently reported some good news as it made a significant announcement regarding its investigational drug zaltenibart (OMS906. It has received a rare pediatric disease designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This designation is for the drug’s potential use in treating complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a rare and serious kidney disorder that primarily affects children and young adults. Additionally, Omeros’ (NASDAQ:OMER) zaltenibart is being developed for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), another rare disease, for which it has already received orphan drug designation from the FDA. The market for PNH treatments is anticipated to grow substantially, from $3.9 billion in 2023 to $10.1 billion by 2032, reflecting the increasing demand for effective therapies for these complex conditions. Overall, OMER ranks 11th on our list of stocks under Jim Cramer's lightning rounds' spotlight. While we acknowledge the potential of OMER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OMER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Cramer noted that many investors are betting that a business-friendly administration will continue to drive better returns. “See, after all these gains, you gotta get a little squeamish, don’t you? Unless something drastic happens in the next few weeks, we’re in line for our second straight year of 20% plus returns for the S&P 500. First time that’s happened since 1999, ooh, not the best precedent. Plus, the market’s gotten really expensive by historical standards.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch Cramer said that his main worry is that Wall Street may have gotten ahead of itself, with too many investors expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than are realistically likely. He highlighted the unusual situation that has unfolded since the Fed’s surprise double rate cut in September. While short-term interest rates have come down, long-term rates set by the bond market have actually risen, creating a stark contrast. He remarked: “The market’s betting on a December rate cut. Anything that derails that will be bad news for the averages.” When looking ahead to 2025, Cramer noted a significant lack of consensus about future rate cuts. He pointed to Fed funds futures for December 2025, which show a wide range of predicted outcomes. Investors are betting on anywhere from zero to eight rate cuts by then, with the most likely scenario being three cuts by the end of 2025. Cramer explained that while he thinks three rate cuts sound reasonable, it also suggests that roughly 41% of the market is anticipating too many cuts over the next year, a scenario that could disappoint many money managers. “So here’s the bottom line: Given all the success we’ve had in this market, we need to guard against complacency and that’s why I’m flagging my biggest worry that the market might be getting too aggressive with its expectations for rate cuts over the next year.” For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A busy airport terminal, highlighting the company's strong transportation arm. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 When asked about Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL), Cramer said: “This stock’s up 120%. Now I will tell you, Sterling infrastructure… It is living off, I think, a lot of the federal money that’s been spent. So, I don’t want to get greedy… Take some off the table and let the rest run.” Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) provides a range of services, including site development for e-commerce, data centers, and power generation, infrastructure projects for transportation systems, and concrete foundations and plumbing services for residential and commercial buildings. It works with federal, state, and municipal governments, particularly state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other regional authorities overseeing airports, ports, water systems, and railroads. Four state DOTs accounted for half of the segment’s revenue in 2023, a slight increase from 44% in 2022 and 42% in 2021. In the third-quarter earnings call, management highlighted that the company is currently in the second half of the federal funding cycle for transportation projects. They mentioned that the company has built up a backlog of over two years and continues to see strong activity in the sector. Management believes that the company is positioned in a market environment that supports sustained growth above historical levels, assuming margins hold steady or improve. In addition to its transportation work, Sterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) continues to benefit from the growing demand for hyperscale data center development. Earlier this year, its subsidiary, Plateau Excavation, was awarded a data center project in the southeastern U.S., valued at approximately $100 million. The project includes 280 acres of site work, with 125,000 linear feet of underground infrastructure installation.
