(NASDAQ:VTRS), an American global pharmaceutical and healthcare company, registered a 2.82-percent drop in its share prices on Wednesday to end at $11.39 per share as investors sold off positions following analyst remarks that the company already entered the oversold territory. The news further dampened investor sentiment. Viatris’ (VTRS) shares dropped by 4.92 percent in the past week alone, by 9.10 percent during the past month, by 3.06 percent over the past year, and by a whopping 47.41 percent in the past five years alone.

Title: Is Tokenization The Future Of Index And Exchange-Traded Funds?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/15/is-tokenization-the-future-of-index-and-exchange-traded-funds/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T03:52:51Z

Index and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the landscape of investing over the past few decades. They have opened the markets to millions of investors, offering accessible investment solutions. In the past decades, technological and financial innovations have been greatly interlinked, and it seems that the next step in financial innovation is the tokenization of these funds. Based on research, policy papers, and initiatives from leading international organizations and financial institutions, such as the World Economic Forum, Franklin Templeton, or Deutsche Börse, it is highly plausible that tokenization will be the next major development in the financial world, as Larry Fink (and other) envisioned. “ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets. Step two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.” – Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock In this article, we will explore the evolution of ETFs from their origins as index funds, analyze the factors contributing to their widespread popularity among investors, and discuss the potential advantages of transitioning ETFs into tokenized formats. SUQIAN, CHINA - MAY 1, 2024 - Illustration ETF, Suqian, Jiangsu province, China, July 1, 2024. ... [+] (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) The rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is closely connected with the history of index investing. Index investing allows investors to diversify and ultimately apply well-known portfolio investing strategies, minimizing their risks. Back in the 1970s, the idea of index investing came around. Influential works like Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) argued that most investors would be better off with a low-cost, diversified portfolio that tracked a broad market index rather than attempting to beat the market. This concept laid the foundation for what would become a major shift in investment strategy. Shortly after the book came out, in 1973, Wells Fargo and American National Bank launched the first index mutual funds for institutional customers. Just a few years later, Vanguard, led by John Bogle, introduced the First Index Investment Trust, a fund that tracked the S&P 500. Initially starting with only $11 million, this fund was met with skepticism and mockingly dubbed "Bogle's folly." However, the fund's long-term success, now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, proved its critics wrong and remains one of the largest and most successful mutual funds in history. This marked the beginning of a shift toward passive investing—investing in a portfolio that tracks market indices rather than actively trying to outperform them. Innovation often finds its roots in financial crises, as seen with the emergence of Bitcoin following the 2007–2008 financial meltdown, the same was the case for the birth of ETFs after the 1987 stock market crash. During the 1987 crash, institutional investors identified a critical need to trade large stock volumes quickly and on an intraday basis. In response, a Los Angeles-based firm, Leland, O'Brien, and Rubinstein, proposed a novel idea in 1990: grouping stocks into a “basket” and placing it on an exchange to trade it as a single unit. This concept materialized as the SuperTrust fund. Despite its innovation, SuperTrust struggled due to high minimum investment requirements and fizzled out after a few years. When ETFs were officially introduced in 1993, they debuted quietly, drawing little attention from average investors. For nearly a decade, trading activity remained minimal, with ETFs only surpassing 1% of fund trading volume by 2000, despite their growing recognition among major investors. Today, ETFs are among the most popular investments for institutional and individual investors, usually accounting for between 26% to 30% of the daily trading volume in the U.S. in recent years. With further DLT innovation, we see more and more affinity towards the tokenization of financial assets and, potentially, of ETFs. Tokenization of ETFs is not the same thing as the Crypto ETFs In 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs and ETPs and approved the sale of spot ETFs in the United States. The SEC combined proposals from the Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE exchanges, which requested changes to existing rules to allow the trading of Ethereum Exchange-Rraded Products (ETPs) and ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are financial instruments tracking Bitcoin’s price by holding the actual cryptocurrency in reserve and backing each share of the ETF with real Bitcoin. These ETFs allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without the need to buy, store, or manage Bitcoin themselves in a specific crypto wallet. They function similarly to traditional ETFs but focus specifically on BTC as the underlying asset. As of December 2024, there were twelve spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the United States. Within nine months of launch, these products accumulated over $49 billion in assets across the top providers, demonstrating strong market demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. The SEC's approval of options trading for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust in September 2024 further legitimized this new asset class within traditional financial frameworks. However, the tokenization of classical ETFs is different from Bitcoin ETFs. Tokenization of ETFs changes not the underlying financial asset but the underlying technology. It promises to enhance their value by transforming them into decentralized digital assets that can be created more swiftly and cost-effectively. Decentralizing enables instant trading without the need for traditional intermediaries, thereby reducing or eliminating associated institutional fees. Such advancements increase accessibility, improve liquidity, and streamline transactions for investors, but might be concerning from the perspective of investors’ protection and sufficient oversight and control over the trading. The financial industry is experiencing a transformative moment as it navigates the intersection between traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain technology. According to Franklin Templeton's survey conducted in November 2024, financial institutions face significant challenges in their efforts to tokenize traditional assets such as equities, bonds, and funds. The existing technological infrastructure and deeply entrenched systems have proven resistant to wholesale replacement, requiring a more gradual approach to transformation. Rather than attempting an immediate transition to fully tokenized assets, the industry is adopting a staged evolution toward a digital financial ecosystem. The initial phase of this transformation, commonly referred to as "ETF-ization," is already gaining momentum across the financial sector. ETFs have emerged as the ideal vehicle to bridge traditional and digital finance, primarily due to their inherent flexibility and well-established regulatory framework. This strategic approach offers several significant advantages for the industry's digital transformation. ETFs excel at facilitating the efficient “bundling” of diverse assets, allowing for seamless integration of both traditional and alternative investments within a single instrument. This capability has proven particularly valuable as institutions seek ways to incorporate non-traditional assets into conventional portfolio structures. Furthermore, ETFs provide an excellent testing ground for new technological infrastructure, allowing financial institutions to experiment with digital innovations while operating within familiar regulatory boundaries. The transition toward tokenized ETFs presents complex technical challenges that require careful consideration and innovative solutions. The industry must develop robust systems that can reliably track ownership and maintain secure custody of assets across both traditional and digital platforms. A fundamental requirement for tokenized ETFs is the implementation of sophisticated ownership tracking systems that can seamlessly integrate with both traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain networks, which is not an easy ask. These systems must maintain accurate asset ownership records while ensuring secure custody arrangements that meet regulatory requirements. Financial institutions are developing new security protocols to protect against emerging threats unique to the digital asset space. One such threat is "dusting" attacks, where malicious actors send minimal amounts of cryptocurrency to wallet addresses in attempts to deanonymize their owners. Understanding and mitigating these new forms of security risks is crucial for the industry's evolution. The success of tokenized ETFs depends heavily on achieving seamless interoperability between traditional financial systems and blockchain networks. This requires the development of standardized data formats and communication protocols that can facilitate efficient information exchange across different platforms. Smart contract capabilities must be integrated thoughtfully to ensure automated processes maintain the same level of security and reliability as traditional methods. The expansion of tokenized ETFs introduces several significant challenges, as outlined in the recent OECD Policy Paper on Tokenisation of Assets and DLT in Financial Markets, which must be carefully managed to ensure market stability and investor protection. The introduction of tokenized ETFs could alter existing market-making models. Traditional market makers may need to adapt their strategies and systems to accommodate tokenized assets, which may temporarily affect market liquidity and price discovery mechanisms. A particular concern is the potential fragmentation of liquidity between traditional and tokenized markets. When the same asset trades in both tokenized and traditional forms, there's a risk of creating separate liquidity pools that could operate with different pricing dynamics. This bifurcation could be particularly pronounced during periods of market stress, potentially leading to pricing discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities. Price discovery mechanisms may also evolve as tokenized ETFs gain prominence. While DLT offers enhanced transparency for transaction data and asset characteristics, the potential for trading across multiple platforms—both on-chain and off-chain—could create challenges for efficient price discovery. This is especially relevant for "real-world assets" that maintain both traditional and tokenized representations. Financial institutions must develop robust cybersecurity frameworks specifically designed for tokenized assets. These frameworks need to address not only traditional security concerns but also blockchain-specific vulnerabilities. Regular security audits and updates will be crucial to maintaining system integrity. Regulatory compliance presents another significant challenge, particularly given the global nature of digital assets. Institutions must navigate varying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions while ensuring their tokenized ETF offerings maintain compliance with all applicable rules. This may require sophisticated compliance monitoring systems and regular engagement with regulatory authorities, While the Financial Stability Board's 2024 analysis indicates that tokenization currently poses minimal systemic risk, the growing adoption of tokenized ETFs could introduce new considerations for financial stability. The success of this transformation will largely depend on several key factors: Market acceptance and adoption will ultimately determine the success of tokenized ETFs. The suggested pathway to full asset tokenization through ETFs represents a measured and pragmatic approach to modernizing financial markets. By starting with familiar investment vehicles like ETFs, the industry can build experience and confidence with tokenization while maintaining market stability and security. As market participants gain expertise with tokenized ETFs, they will establish the foundation for broader asset tokenization initiatives, potentially revolutionizing how financial assets are traded and managed in the future.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street equities finished lower Thursday following a mixed US retail sales report, while European luxury stocks pushed higher following strong results from Cartier owner Richemont. Major US indices spent part of the day in positive territory but were unable to extend Wednesday's rally in a session Briefing.com described as "lackluster." US retail sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December, a slower pace than in November but still a solid increase. In a separate report, the National Retail Federation estimated the growth in US holiday sales at four percent for 2024, topping estimates. The retail figures came on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index figures, which eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high. After major indices gained around two percent Wednesday, all three finished lower on Thursday. But bourses in Europe and Asia pushed higher. The Paris stock market surged more than two percent after Cartier owner Richemont reported record quarterly sales. The Swiss luxury firm ended the day more than 16 percent higher. Sales in Richemont's Asia-Pacific region fell seven percent in the third quarter, dragged down by an 18 percent drop in China, Hong Kong and Macau. But the company enjoyed double-digit increases in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. "It seems that despite the challenging situation in China and in watches, Richemont has never been stronger," said Jean-Philippe Bertschy, analyst at investment firm Vontobel. In Paris, shares of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci owner Kering rose, while Burberry forged higher in London. London rose more than one percent even as data showed the UK economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in November. "It is a sea of green in the European equity space..." noted Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group. "There are threats to inflation down the road, but they are concerns for another day. "For now, stocks are playing catch up, bonds remain stable and the weakening in the dollar in recent days has helped to boost risk sentiment." Still, there remains a certain amount of caution ahead of Donald Trump returning to the White House on Monday. The Republican has promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations, something that many fear could reignite inflation. - Key figures around 2130 GMT - New York - Dow: DOWN 0.2 percent at 43,153.13 (close) New York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.2 percent at 5,937.34 (close) New York - Nasdaq Composite: DOWN 0.9 percent at 19,338.29 (close) London - FTSE 100: UP 1.1 percent at 8,391.90 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 2.1 percent at 7,634.74 (close) Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.4 percent at 20,655.39 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 38,572.60 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.2 percent at 19,522.89 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 3,236.03 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0306 from $1.0289 on Wednesday Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2237 from $1.2242 Dollar/yen: DOWN at 155.17 yen from 156.47 yen Euro/pound: UP at 84.18 pence from 84.04 pence West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.7 percent at $78.68 per barrel Brent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.9 percent at $81.29 per barrel burs-jmb/dw Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Aligned Data Centers gets $12B to expand its AI compute capacity

Time Published: 2025-01-16T01:06:25Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 20:06 EST / JANUARY 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley Data center operator Aligned Data Centers LLC said today it has raised a massive $12 billion in funding in order to accelerate the buildout of its artificial intelligence-focused infrastructure. The money came from two sources: $5 billion in primary equity from funds managed by Macquarie Asset Management and $7 billion in new debt commitments. Aligned, which is based in Plano, Texas, said it will use the money to construct more than 5 gigawatts of future AI computing capacity across North America and Latin America in order to meet skyrocketing demand from its customers. Aligned Chief Executive Andrew Schaap said his company is uniquely positioned to meet the growing demand for AI compute capacity, as it has more than a decade of experience in deploying the innovative cooling solutions required for the graphics processing units that power most AI workloads. “This investment will fuel our continued growth, enabling us to deliver cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving demands of our customers today and in the future,” he said. Aligned operates a number of colocation data centers that rent capacity to customers, and it also builds data center facilities for hyperscale and enterprise firms. It currently operates data centers in Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Northern Virginia, and its building additional sites in Illinois, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia. In addition, it has a massive operation in Latin America, having acquired a company called OData in May 2023, which has facilities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. It’s also an investor in the Canadian data center operator QScale SEC, which gives it a foothold in that country as well. The rapid growth of AI over the last couple of years, driven by the popularity of large language models and chatbots like ChatGPT, has led to rising demand for high-capacity data centers that can cluster thousands of GPUs together in order to run those workloads. Aligned’s business has grown tremendously as a result of this demand. Big tech firms such as Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC are also spending billions of dollars to build out their AI compute capacity. Last week, Microsoft revealed that it’s planning to invest as much as $80 billion into its data center building program in fiscal 2025 as it strives to maintain its leadership in AI innovation. That came after it revealed in September that it’s collaborating with BlackRock Inc. to create a $100 billion fund that will fuel the development of new data centers and energy projects. Energy is just as important as the data centers themselves, which explains why Microsoft, Google and Amazon.com Inc. have all expressed an interest in nuclear power sources recently. There are many specialist firms operating in this industry too. For instance, Crusoe Energy Systems LLC, which is focused on providing clean energy for data centers, last month closed on a $600 million funding round.

Title: Trump Considers Suspending TikTok Ban Enforcement For 60 To 90 Days: Report

TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported President-elect Donald Trump, whose term begins a day after a ban would start, is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of a shutdown for 60 to 90 days. The newspaper did not say how Trump could legally do so. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, except that the law also bars U.S. companies starting Sunday from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it. The Trump transition team did not have an immediate comment. Trump has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue. "TikTok itself is a fantastic platform," Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Wednesday. "We're going to find a way to preserve it but protect people's data." A White House official told Reuters Wednesday President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the Supreme Court fails to act and added Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. U.S. Senator Ed Markey on Wednesday sought unanimous consent to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok by 270 days but Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked the proposal. If it is banned, TikTok plans that users attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. "We go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down," TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court last week. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, the sources said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Shutting down TikTok in the U.S. could make it unavailable for users in many other countries, the company said in a court filing last month, because hundreds of service providers in the U.S. help make the platform available to TikTok users around the world - and could no longer do so starting Sunday. TikTok said in the court filing an order was needed to "avoid interruption of services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States." TikTok had said that the prohibitions would eventually make the app unusable, noting in the filing that "data centers would almost certainly conclude that they can no longer store" TikTok code, content, or data. The sources said the shutdown aims to protect TikTok service providers from legal liability and make it easier to resume operations if President-elect Donald Trump opted to roll back any ban. Shutting down such services does not require longer planning, one of the sources said, noting that most operations have been continuing as usual as of this week. If the ban gets reversed later, TikTok would be able to restore service for U.S. users in a relatively short time, sources said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. U.S. tech publication The Information first reported the news late on Tuesday. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden last April signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in the court filing last month it estimated one-third of its 170 million American users would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasted a month.

At the outset, RWA tokenization represents real-world assets such as bonds, real estate, or private credit as digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling these traditionally illiquid assets to be traded and managed more efficiently. In effect, tokenization allows traditional financial institutions to fractionalize ownership, automate compliance, and access markets around the clock. “RWA tokenization has made significant strides recently. The real question for 2025: How many assets will integrate into this system, and how quickly will global adoption unfold?” Moataz Elsayed, co-founder of non-custodial wallet Okse, told Decrypt. Total value locked in tokenized assets reached over $176 billion in 2024, marking a 32% increase year-to-date, with non-stablecoin assets growing by 53%, a 2024 report from the Tokenized Asset Coalition (TAC) shows. RWA tokenization is “transforming finance” with BlackRock “driving adoption” through stablecoins and other permissioned services, Neal Wen, head of global business development at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. “Real estate, treasuries, and other assets are becoming liquid on the blockchain, unlocking over $18 billion in market value with significant growth potential on the horizon.” BlackRock launched its tokenized fund in March last year, followed by other institutions such as Franklin Templeton launching on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer-2 network. Major institutions such as McKinsey claim that tokenization presents financial institutions with a "strategic advantage" while cautioning them about "pessimistic and optimistic scenarios" that could range between $1 trillion to $4 trillion valuations for the sector by 2030. Major financial institutions entering the space further evidenced the sector's growth. Standard Chartered projected $30 trillion in tokenized assets by 2034, while Boston Consulting Group estimated $16 trillion in tokenized illiquid assets by 2030. Decentralized credit marketplace Clearpool shared with Decrypt that Ozean, the RWA-focused protocol it is building, has onboarded over 368,000 unique accounts for its Poseidon testnet. “While tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate RWA use cases, the future promises growing traction in real estate, private credit, and other asset classes like commodities,” Clearpool CEO and co-founder Jakob Kronbichler told Decrypt in an interview. Clearpool claimed in its Q4 report that it had processed over $650 million in total loans originated for Q4 2024 alone, achieving a 51% increase in total value locked. “BlackRock's credibility in the RWA movement is paving the way for other institutions to follow suit,” Kronbichler told Decrypt. Private credit has proven particularly hot, with Clearpool Prime garnering $124 million in loans since launching in December 2023. The surge mirrors a broader trend of traditional financial institutions warming up to tokenized markets, according to research from DeFi liquidity protocol Tren Finance. Executives across broader sectors are paying attention, too. Some 86% of Fortune 500 executives now see the benefits of tokenization, with 35% already cooking up tokenization projects, the TAC report shows. “Tokenization offers numerous advantages, solving a variety of problems in TradFi,” Kronbichler explained, citing use cases for liquidity, fractional ownership, automation, transparency, and programmability. Innovation in treasury products hasn't slowed either. Platforms are rolling out features that institutional investors have been craving, like round-the-clock redemptions and peer-to-peer transfers—making blockchain-based finance look increasingly attractive to the suit-and-tie crowd. Kronbichler also points to recent political shifts in the U.S. that he recognizes as catalysts that could push traditional finance “to engage with RWAs.” In December last year, President-elect Donald Trump named Paul Atkins to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Kronbichler noted that this appointment is crucial because Atkins “brings expertise that could drive regulatory transparency and accelerate institutional adoption.” Atkins is a member of the advisory board at Securitize, a Clearpool partner specializing in tokenization and collaborating with BlackRock.

Title: Chip Roy Warns That Republicans Will Break Migration Promises if Voters Stay Silent
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/01/15/chip-roy-warn-gop-will-break-migration-promises-voters-stay-silent/
Time Published: 2025-01-15T23:25:07Z
Full Content:
Citizens must pressure Republicans politicians to fulfill their campaign promises on migration, or the legislators will submit to donors and lobbyists, Texas Rep. Chip Roy (R) told a D.C. meeting on January 14. “Here’s my big bet [for 2025] … Republicans are going to kowtow to big corporate America, K Street lobbyists for cheaper labor, and for tax cuts while the American worker gets screwed — that’s what’s going to happen if people don’t stand up and try to change that,” Roy told a meeting hosted by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Roy has worked on Capitol Hill since 2003, first as a Senate staffer. In 2019, he took his seat in the House and has since played a leading role in migration politics. Those two decades have given him an inside view of money-driven politics in the federal government. “We have utterly failed to address the problem,” Roy said. “If we set out to reverse the damage that’s been done over the next, say, four years of the Trump administration, what are the odds that we do that?” he asked the audience, adding: What are the odds that we actually remove all of the people that people are saying we’re going to remove? I have great faith in Tom Homan — he’s a good and dear friend. I’ve great faith in Stephen Miller. I have great faith in the president [who has] the motives, the desires to undo the damage of the Biden administration. But is anybody going to Vegas and bet up or down on whether we remove half of the people that have come here? Twenty percent? Would you go bet your life savings that we will remove even 20 percent of the people who have come here illegally? “I will be very surprised that the willpower of the average Republican is strong enough to do that,” he said after the event. Watch: The reality of hardball politics, Roy said, is that “big corporate interests want cheap labor at the expense of American labor, while the culture of our country is getting twisted around.” He continued: Open borders are being ignored, and while Republicans go out and campaign on securing them, [they] never fully secure them, and never undo the damage of the fact that they were unsecured in the first place. That’s the truth. How do I know this? Well, in 2006 and [200]7, when I was in the [Senate] judiciary committee dealing with all of those amnesty bills — that’s what they were — and working through those problems. Then fast forward to 2012 and [20]13 during the “Gang of Eight” [amnesty bill] … then fast forward to 2017 with Goodlatte, we have utterly failed to ever address the problem. And here’s the issue, right? We talk about all of the illegal numbers, yet we let in something like 3 million people a year into our country legally — a million-ish green cards, a million-ish guest workers, a million-ish foreign students each year. Three million! we’ve let in more people than every country in the world combined. The annual legal inflow — not counting illegals — adds up to almost one permanent or temporary migrant for each of the roughly 3.6 million Americans that are born each year. That annual inflow includes roughly 800,000 foreign graduates for white-collar jobs sought by American graduates. For example, the federal government allows companies and their foreign hiring managers to import roughly 120,000 H-1B contract workers for jobs that would otherwise go to better-paid and more innovative Americans. Companies favor those workers, in part, because they are being paid by the government’s offer of green cards. In contrast, American professionals must be paid in cash, which reduces the companies’ stock values and executive bonuses. This hidden non-dollar economy helps to explain why investors — such as Elon Musk — are determined to protect the H-1B program from popular reforms implemented by Trump in 2020. The reforms were killed by President Joe Biden’s deputies, who have sharply increased the white-collar inflow. That huge inflow is blocking many young Americans from jobs. On January 15, the Wall Street Journal reported: Landing a professional job in the U.S. has become so tough that even Harvard Business School says its M.B.A.s can’t solely rely on the university’s name to open doors anymore. Twenty-three percent of job-seeking Harvard M.B.A.s who graduated last spring were still looking for work three months after leaving campus. That share is up from 20% the prior year, during a cooling white-collar labor market; the figure was 10% in 2022, according to the school. “We should freeze all inflow, probably with some notable exceptions,” Roy said after the CIS event, and continued: [A freeze] would put a whole hell of a lot of pressure on making sure Americans are given opportunities to work … If you look at the numbers, we are crushing the average American worker, and we’re subsidizing corporations to bring in cheaper labor at the expense of American workers … if wages go up on the average American worker, I’d say that’s probably a good thing. But GOP legislators, he said, “pretty much, what they do is the bidding of whoever’s in there yelling out the loudest saying, ‘I want cheap labor.'” For example, Republicans are not focused on the alternative economic strategy of raising Americans’ wealth-generating productivity with automation and training, he said. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink oversees an investment portfolio of $10 trillion as he tries to stay ahead of China’s low-migration, high-tech manufacturing sector: That [less-migration strategy] is something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In the United States, “75 percent of college graduates who majored in a STEM field are not employed in a STEM occupation,” he told the meeting. “For the last 50 years, we have jammed our foot on the accelerator through both legal and illegal immigration — anybody on K Street [or] anybody in corporate America, who tells you otherwise is lying,” he added. “I think the average American family who’s out there working hard, are being stepped on by a government that is more interested in corporate bottom lines than boosting them,” Roy said. “Hopefully the Trump administration will do something about that.” However, Trump has periodically slammed Roy over federal spending, which Roy prefers to reduce.

In addition, the hiring of Maddox, the former chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts, also brought to the surface rumors that Authentic may once again consider going public, a plan it set in motion in 2021 but pulled back after CVC Capital and HPS Investment Partners, along with its other shareholders, which include BlackRock, Simon Property Group, Leonard Green & Partners and others purchased significant equity in Authentic. Reviving those plans or finding new investors are both on the table, sources said, citing a recent report by Bloomberg that the investor group is in talks to buy BlackRock’s equity stake, which is valued at $3 billion or more. BlackRock’s Long-Term Private Capital Fund paid $875 million for the stake in 2019 but that fund is being closed.

Title: XRP Hits 7-Year High Above $3 as Large Holders Accumulate $3.8B of Tokens
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/15/xrp-hits-7-year-high-above-3-as-large-holders-accumulate-3-8-b-of-tokens

XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger network closely related to Ripple, surged to a six-year high on Wednesday as bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $100,000, with traders encouraged by this morning's highly-anticipated U.S. CPI inflation data report. The token briefly topped $3 during early U.S. trading session for the first time since early 2018 January, before slightly paring gains. Recently changing hands at $2.95, it was 11% over the past 24 hours, outperforming bitcoin's (BTC) 3.6% and the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's 6.7% advances during the same period. XRP has been among the best-performing tokens, with a 488% gain since Donald Trump's election victory. It has now become the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind BTC and Ethereum's ether (ETH), reclaiming its third ranking from Tether's USDT stablecoin. At $170 billion of market value, the token is now larger than the market capitalization of asset management giant BlackRock (BLK).The gain was fueled by anticipation of crypto-friendly policies and an overhaul of digital asset regulation in the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple have been in a legal battle for years over XRP token sales. "This surge is driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF," Diego Cardenas, OTC trader and at digital asset platform Abra, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Ripple President Monica Long said in an interview last week that she expects a spot ETF to be approved "very soon" as approvals with the incoming administration will accelerate. XRP also broke out of the consolidation pattern started in early December that CoinDesk markets analyst Omkar Godbole noted last week, paving the way for the next leg in the token's rally. Another 15% rise from current prices would mean fresh all-time highs above the 2018 January top of $3.4. Still, adjusting for inflation over the years, XRP has to surpass $4.24 for a new high, Galaxy head of research Alex Thorn said in an X post. Large investors' accumulating XRP tokens over the past two months could also fuel the rally towards new records. Analytics firm Santiment noted that addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens increased their holdings by 1.4 billion coins — worth roughly $3.8 billion — since November 12, continuing the accumulation while prices consolidated following early December highs.Read more: XRP Interest Jumps as Brad Garlinghouse Meets With Trump Krisztian Sandor recently graduated from NYU's business and economic reporter program as a Fulbright fellow and worked with Reuters and Forbes previously.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Bolt’s $450 Million Raise Is Locked In Legal Battle. But This Investor Is Cashing Out
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/01/15/bolts-450-million-raise-is-locked-in-legal-battle-but-this-investor-is-cashing-out/
Time Published: 2025-01-15T19:00:41Z
Full Content:
Bolt founder Ryan Breslow’s long-running dispute with shareholder Activant has ended but the fate of his plan to raise a $450 million for the struggling payments startup remains on ice. A Delaware court has given the greenlight for payments startup Bolt to settle with investor Activant over a dispute involving a $30 million loan to founder Ryan Breslow. In August, Ryan Breslow stunned investors with his plan to return to the helm of payments startup Bolt. But that shock quickly turned to anger when investors like Blackrock and Hedosophia realized Breslow aimed to effectively wipe out shareholders who didn’t buy into the $450 million raise. Blackrock and Hedosophia sued to block the round a month later. Six months later, the deal is still on ice. But one Bolt shareholder has managed to escape the turmoil. Delaware’s Court of the Chancery ruled in a December 16 hearing that Bolt investor Activant Capital could sell $37 million of its shares back to the startup. That ruling ends a legal battle that began in July 2023, when Activant sued Breslow, accusing him of saddling the startup with $30 million of debt to repay a personal loan after he defaulted on it. Breslow had used his shares as collateral to take out the loan but instead of allowing them to be cancelled to settle the debt, he repaid the loan using money from the company’s bank accounts, and then fired Activant founder Steve Sarracino and other Bolt board members who opposed the plan. At the time, Breslow’s lawyer said in a dismissal motion it was his “unfettered right” to remove Bolt’s directors, and called Activant’s suit “nothing more than sour grapes.” Bolt and Activant had struck a deal for the lawsuit to be settled back in May 2024 but this was blocked by an objection from a trio of Bolt’s largest backers — BlackRock, Hedosophia and Untitled Investments. Now the courts have allowed the settlement to move ahead. That means Bolt will pay Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s Bolt shares will be cancelled. "For the avoidance of doubt, to borrow a phrase from Activant, nobody is getting a 'gold star' here,” said Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook of Delaware’s Court of the Chancery in the ruling. “Far from it, particularly given the long sequence of events that got us here.” Activant declined to comment. Bolt declined to comment. The ruling is a win for the Connecticut-based venture fund that had sought to rein in Breslow, and to cash out its investment in Bolt, after leading its Series C round in 2019. By January 2022, Breslow had lined up a $355 million investment from Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock, valuing Bolt at over $11 billion, and his own stake made him one of the world’s youngest billionaires. Weeks later he resigned as CEO after a Twitter tirade directed at Stripe, Y Combinator and Sequoia. Then came lawsuits from customers like Authentic Brands Group, claims of inflated metrics and an SEC investigation (which the agency later dropped). He returned in August with a plan to raise $450 million to turn Bolt into a WeChat-style super app. Investors balked over the terms of the deal, which valued Bolt at over $14 billion but returned Breslow as chief executive with a bumper salary and expenses package; entangled the startup with Breslow’s other project, the health marketplace Love; and gave investors just days to commit or see 70% of shares effectively wiped out. To top it all off, Forbes reported that the lead investor named in the round had never heard of Bolt, while at least $250 million of the round came in the form of “marketing credits” from an obscure fund. “They put forward extremely unusual press reports that, to say the least, seemed to contradict and undermine highly material assertions in the company's communications to investors,” noted Vice Chancellor Cook in the ruling. Breslow, Bolt and its remaining shareholders remain stuck in legal limbo, with the BlackRock lawsuit stalled. Bolt’s board has formed a special committee to find a fix for the conflict with its shareholders. But the committee is made up of just one person: Bolt director and video games developer Michael Carter, who is a close friend of Breslow’s. Investors have claimed that Carter is conflicted and pushed for new independent directors to be appointed to Bolt’s board and the special committee reviewing the deal, to no avail. Got a tip for us? Contact reporters Sarah Emerson at semerson@forbes.com or 510-473-8820 on Signal, and Iain Martin at iain.martin@forbes.com. Carter joined the Bolt board in 2023, after Breslow forced out a series of directors from Activant, Tribe Capital and WestCap in March 2023. They were replaced by three of Breslow’s friends: music producer Larrance Dopson, journalist Esther Wojcicki (mother to Susan Wojcicki and “Godmother of Silicon Valley”) and The Mighty Ducks child actor and crypto investor Brock Pierce. Carter and Dobson remain on the Bolt board with property developer Joel Schreiber, who faces contempt of court charges in his ongoing legal dispute with Starwood Property Trust over a $130 million debt. Schreiber did not respond to a comment request. Back in August, Breslow had billed the $450 million fundraise as essential to relaunch Bolt as he warned that the business was losing market share. That sense of urgency seems to have evaporated as Bolt struggles to answer questions about the strange deal. For investors who committed over $1 billion of capital to the one-time rising fintech startup, there was some good news on its financial health from the court hearing. Despite Bolt reportedly losing $310 million on just $27 million of revenue in 2023, Vice Chancellor Cooked noted: “the Company is now in a much better cash position and on better financial footing,” based on numbers revealed in disclosure hearings but not made public. This story has been updated to clarify Breslow’s response to Activant’s lawsuit.

Title: AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS): Analysts Recommend This 52-Week High Stocks Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) stands against the other stocks. After two years of substantial gains to record highs, exhaustion in the US equity markets is slowly kicking in. Pullbacks in various sectors have come into play amid growing concerns about overstretched valuations. Likewise, the pullbacks have come on bond yields surging to levels not seen in two months, triggering a selloff in growth-oriented stocks. The 10-year yield touching highs of 4.79% has once again triggered demand for bonds at the expense of stocks, given the yields on offer. Additionally, the surge in bond yields comes on stronger-than-expected jobs reports that cast doubt on further interest rate cuts. The stock market rallied to record highs last year amid expectations that the Fed will embark on an aggressive easing push that involves interest rate cuts. A spike in inflation levels amid a resilient US job market has once again averted the prospects of the Fed aggressively cutting interest rates. Consequently, the global rise in bond yields around the globe is being driven by expectations of fewer than expected interest rate cuts. READ ALSO: 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for 2025 and Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. “With the 10-year yield potentially getting to 5%, I think it’s going to be very hard for the equity market to really gain any meaningful traction here until there’s — at minimum — stability in interest rates,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. The sentiments echo serious concerns about stocks trading at 52-week highs after blockbuster moves last year. Given that valuations at 52-week highs often appear overstretched, there are growing concerns that some of the stocks could be the subject of significant pullbacks. Amid the concerns, Turnquist does not see the prospect of the market edging into bear territory even though the market appears to be in a correction phase. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the equity market's outlook and believe there is not enough reason to back away from investing. Additionally, the analysts don’t expect 2025 to be a problematic year for equity investments. “Valuations are not a good timing signal. ... There’s no clear relationship between your starting valuation and the returns one year later,” Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation for the group, said Goldman Sachs analysts expect the US economy to grow faster than Europe in 2025. A resilient US economy amid high interest rates should fuel stellar financial results characterized by revenue and earnings growth. “We do think that the earnings advantage that the U.S. has will continue,” said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for the Goldman unit. The prospect of the US economy staying clear of recession even with the Fed leaving interest rates at current levels should offer much-needed support to stocks trading at all-time highs. Analysts also expect friendly regulations and deregulation from the upcoming Republican administration to act as a tailwind to fuel further gains in the equity markets. Our Methodology To make the list of best 52-week high stocks to buy according to analysts, we scanned various screeners focusing on stocks trading close to their 52-week highs. We then settled on stocks trading close to 52-week highs (0-10% below high), which analysts believe boast of 25% or more upside potential as of January 14, owing to their solid underlying fundamentals. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A businessperson in a high-rise office building, demonstrating the protection of professional lines. 52 Week Range: $53.97 - $94.89 Current Share Price: $87.82 Stock Upside Potential: 25.62% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) is a financial services company that provides various specialty insurance and reinsurance products. It offers professional insurance products that cover officers' liability, errors and omissions, employment practices, medical malpractice, and other financial insurance. The company outperformed its peers significantly in 2024, delivering a 62% return, affirming why it is one of the best 52-week highs stocks to buy, according to analysts. Throughout 2024, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) has proactively improved its primary casualty portfolio, anticipating stronger growth in 2025. This growth is supported by strategic changes and a consistent rise in casualty rates despite slower growth in the property segment. Additionally, AXIS Capital focuses on growth areas like lower middle markets and wholesale insurance to become a top specialty underwriter with a diverse portfolio, leadership roles, and expansion prospects positioning its insurance segment for success. Strategic initiatives have been driving improvement in its operating earnings over the past few years. Reaching a general and administrative ratio of less than 11% by 2026 should be possible with the help of streamlining the operating structure, delivering efficiencies, and leveraging productivity gains. AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) has a strong dividend history. It has increased its dividend for 18 years in a row and now yields 1.9%. Overall AXS ranks 13th on our list of the best 52-week high stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AXS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AXS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: This Week in AI: Will Biden's AI actions survive the Trump era? | TechCrunch

If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. This week was something of a swan song for the Biden administration. On Monday, the White House announced sweeping new restrictions on exporting AI chips — restrictions that tech giants, including Nvidia, loudly criticized. (Nvidia’s business would be seriously affected by the restrictions, should they go into effect as proposed.) Then on Tuesday, the administration issued an executive order that opened up federal land to AI data centers. But the obvious question is, will the moves have a lasting impact? Will Trump, who takes office on January 20, simply roll back Biden’s enactments? So far, Trump hasn’t signaled his intentions either way. But he certainly has the power to undo Biden’s last AI acts. Biden’s export rules are scheduled to take effect after a 120-day comment period. The Trump administration will have broad leeway over how the measures are implemented — and whether to change them in any way. As for the executive order pertaining to federal land use, Trump could repeal it. Former PayPal COO David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar,” recently committed to revoking another AI-related Biden executive order that set standards for AI safety and security. However, there’s reason to believe the incoming administration may not rock the boat too much. Along the lines of Biden’s move to free up federal resources for data centers, Trump recently promised expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. He also picked Lee Zeldin, who has vowed to cut regulations he sees as burdensome to businesses, to lead the EPA. Aspects of Biden’s export rules could stand as well. Some of the regulations target China, and Trump has made no secret that he sees China as the U.S.’ biggest rival in AI. One piece in question is Israel’s inclusion in the list of countries subjected to AI hardware trade caps. As recently as October, Trump described himself as a “protector” of Israel and has signaled that he’s likely to be more permissive toward Israel’s military actions in the region. In any event, we’ll have a clearer picture within the week. ChatGPT, remind me to…: Paying users of OpenAI’s ChatGPT can now ask the AI assistant to schedule reminders or recurring requests. The new beta feature, called Tasks, will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. Meta versus OpenAI: Executives and researchers leading Meta’s AI efforts obsessed over beating OpenAI’s GPT-4 model while developing Meta’s own Llama 3 family of models, according to messages unsealed by a court on Tuesday. OpenAI’s board grows: OpenAI has appointed to its board of directors Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi, an executive at investment firm BlackRock. The company’s current board bears little resemblance to OpenAI’s board in late 2023, the members of which fired CEO Sam Altman only to reinstate him days later. Blaize goes public: Blaize is set to become the first AI chip startup to go public in 2025. Founded by former Intel engineers in 2011, the company has raised $335 million from investors, including Samsung for its chips for cameras, drones, and other edge devices. A “reasoning” model that thinks in Chinese: OpenAI’s o1 AI reasoning model “thinks” in languages such as Chinese, French, Hindi, and Thai sometimes, even when asked a question in English — and no one really knows why. A recent study co-authored by Dan Hendrycks, an adviser to billionaire Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, suggests that many safety benchmarks for AI correlate with AI systems’ capabilities. That is to say, as a system’s general performance improves, it “scores better” on benchmarks — making it appear as though the model is “safer.” “Our analysis reveals that many AI safety benchmarks — around half — often inadvertently capture latent factors closely tied to general capabilities and raw training compute,” the researchers behind the study write. “Overall, it is hard to avoid measuring upstream model capabilities in AI safety benchmarks.” In the study, the researchers propose what they describe as an empirical foundation for developing “more meaningful” safety metrics, which they hope will “[advance] the science” of safety evaluations in AI. In a technical paper published Tuesday, Japanese AI company Sakana AI detailed Transformer² (“Transformer-squared”), an AI system that dynamically adjusts to new tasks. Transformer² first analyzes a task — for example, writing code — to understand its requirements. Then it applies “task-specific adaptations” and optimizations to tune to that task. Sakana says the methods behind Transformer² can be applied to open models such as Meta’s Llama and that they offer “a glimpse into a future where AI models are no longer static.” A small team of developers has released an open alternative to AI-powered search engines like Perplexity and OpenAI’s SearchGPT. Called PrAIvateSearch, the project is available on GitHub under an MIT license, meaning that it can be used largely without restriction. It’s powered by openly available AI models and services, including Alibaba’s Qwen family of models and the search engine DuckDuckGo. The PrAIvateSearch team says that its goal is to “implement similar features to SearchGPT,” but in an “open source, local, and private way.” For tips to get it up and running, check out the team’s latest blog post.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc (META): ‘I Find It To Be Little More Prurient’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks. In one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, "Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming." He shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. "House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter," Cramer remarked. He added "What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough." Another news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could "be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal." One person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. "I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top," believes Cramer. He added "We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state." On the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months "Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership," he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes "you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow." Finally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared "I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified." Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated "I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The technology-focused nature of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg proved to be a boon for the stock in 2024. Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s shares ended the year 69% higher as investors were optimistic about its ability to monetize AI by selling features to advertisers. The firm also enjoys a strong moat in the AI sector as it has developed a foundational AI model. In 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s been in the news for scrapping fact-checking in the US and for Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Here's what Cramer said: "I know Meta AI is supposed to be the most exciting. I find it to be little more prurient. When it comes to the metaverse I thought that Ralph Lauren was supposed to have a mall right next to, I don't know, Macy's. Hasn't really turned out that way but at the same time the dialogue has switched mostly to Taekwondo and rifles. And David, you better start shooting pigs [referring to Zuckerberg's hobby of hunting boars] if you want to be on board here. Overall META ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed sharply higher Wednesday as cooling inflation and strong quarterly earnings from Wall Street banks stoked bullish sentiment on stocks. At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 703 points, or 1.7%, the S&P 500 index added 1.8%, and the NASDAQ Composite climbed 2.5%. Sentiment has been boosted Wednesday after data showed the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI gained 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. However, the surprise came with the so-called “core” figure, which strips out volatile components like fuel and food. This rose 0.2% on a monthly basis and 3.2% year-on-year, below expectations for 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively. Still, some on Wall Street continue to see risks for inflation and reiterate expectations for just one cut this year. "Our baseline remains for just one further 25 bps cut from the FOMC, with the most likely timing being March or May. Risks remain skewed to a later date," Macquarie said in a note. Heading into the report, concerns had been swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. Markets are positioning for a much slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2025, with the Federal Reserve forecasting just two rate cuts - a trend that could bode poorly for risk-driven assets. There had been fears before this release that the Fed may actually be forced by sticky inflation to raise rates this year. In the corporate sector, a number of major banks impressed with their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, offering a boost to the waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2% after the investment banking giant posted record annual profit as its dealmakers and traders reaped a windfall from rebounding markets in the fourth quarter. The Wall Street bank also touted increased share buybacks. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock soared 6% after the investment bank’s profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter, driven by strong reading results. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock gained nearly 7% after the lender reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter, buoyed by stronger investment banking earnings. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, climbed 5% after reporting a beat on both the top and bottom lines as its assets hit a record high in Q4. Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (NASDAQ:BECN) rose more than 7% after the building products distributor said QXO had made an deal worth $11 billion to buy the company. President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday that Israel and Hamas reached ceasefire and hostage deal to end 15 months of war on the Gaza strip. (Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)

Goldman Sachs Group has created a Capital Solutions Group that will bring together its financing, origination, structuring and risk management solutions in its Global Banking & Markets business. The global financial institution will also expand the alternatives investment team in its Asset & Wealth Management business, according to a Monday (Jan. 13) press release. Both moves are meant to enhance Goldman Sachs Group’s ability to serve corporate and investor clients and grow its business in private credit, private equity and other asset classes, per the release. “Our strategy and core franchise strengths position Goldman Sachs to operate at the fulcrum of one of the most important structural trends taking place in finance: the emergence and growth of private credit and other asset classes that can be privately deployed,” Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO David Solomon said in the release. The new Capital Service Group is designed to better coordinate, innovate and deliver services to clients by combining the capabilities of Goldman Sachs Group’s Financing Group, Financial Sponsors coverage from Investment Banking and coverage of Alternative Management firms from FICC and Equities, according to the release. The group will be led by Pete Lyon, who is currently global head of the Financial Institutions Group and the Financial and Strategic Investors Group, and Mahesh Saireddy, who is currently global head of Mortgages and Structured Products, per the release. They will also join the firm’s management committee. “There is significant demand from our investing clients for private credit and private equity — from investment grade and leveraged lending to hybrid capital and asset-backed finance as well as equity,” Solomon said in the release. The private credit market is booming, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating that it tops $2 trillion, PYMNTS reported in October. Several other companies have announced bank/asset manager tie-ups meant to put tens of billions of dollars to work in private credit. These include partnerships of JPMorgan Chase with Cliffwater, FS Investments and Shenkman Capital Management; Citigroup with Apollo Global Management; and BlackRock with Santander. In May, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook highlighted private credit as an emerging vulnerability to financial stability, saying private credit funds’ assets under management have grown rapidly in recent years and may involve “weak underwriting or excessive risk appetite.” For all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.

Title: We Are All Going to Pay For the L.A. Fires

By Lois Parshley This article was originally published by The Lever, an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever’s free newsletter. Over a year before Los Angeles’ uncontrollable wildfires burned through neighborhoods once considered safe, the office of California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara quietly shared a potential regulatory plan with insurance company lobbyists. It was a draft of reforms that would allow insurers to raise rates and pass costs on to consumers, among other industry-friendly changes, in exchange for little more than the companies’ word that they would cover homes in wildfire-prone areas. “What do you think of the language below,” one lobbyist responded, according to records obtained by The Lever, along with a detailed edit. “I am really trying to get them to a happy place,” she wrote, referring to her insurance-industry client. The changes the lobbyist suggested appeared to be included in legislation floated in September 2023, although the potential bill was dropped after an advocacy group leaked a recording of industry lobbyists loudly bragging about their role in the bill’s development. Several weeks later, Lara announced a package of executive actions that covered similar ground. “The current system is not working for all Californians, and we must change course,” said Lara, a Democrat elected in 2018 with the help of significant donations from the insurance industry. “I will continue to partner with all those who want to work toward real solutions.” Lara did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The emails are just one example of the conflicts of interest behind the reforms the commissioner has made to address California’s insurance crisis. As record wildfires flare up all over California, homeowners have faced skyrocketing prices, and many have found they can no longer find insurance at all. Meanwhile, insurers claim California’s regulations have kept premiums artificially low, and many are leaving the state. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The clock is ticking to find a solution, since L.A.’s fires, estimated to cost $250 billion in total economic damage, may bring the situation to a breaking point — with repercussions far beyond California. Many homeowners in the state have turned to an insurance program called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan. Created for people who can’t find insurance through the market and run by insurance companies under the commissioner’s oversight, FAIR Plan policies are often more expensive and provide less coverage than traditional plans. As private insurers fled California, the program swelled over 60 percent in the last year. It now has $450 billion in liabilities, though it only has about $385 million in funds to handle them. The outstanding balance, thanks to Lara’s recent deals with the industry, can now be passed on to homeowners. It’s a predicament that will likely soon occur all over the country. When state last-resort insurance programs can’t afford to cover mounting climate disasters, the recovery costs will be shifted from insurers to the general public, with potentially disastrous consequences. “These states are putting our national economy at risk,” says Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace. The FAIR Plan’s vast liabilities are “a big gamble,” Victoria Roach, president of California’s insurer of last resort, told the state legislature last spring. The program, she warned, was just one major event away from insolvency. Related Content Recording Academy Announces Grammy Week Changes Amid L.A. Fires Death Toll Rises to at Least 25 People in Los Angeles Wildfires Octavia Butler Wanted to Prevent Disaster in Los Angeles. Instead, She Predicted It Bill Burr Roasts Internet Fools Over L.A. Fire Chatter “Are these wildfires that disaster?” asked Ben Keys, an economist and professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. As L.A. continued to burn, the FAIR Plan had an estimated $5.85 billion worth of policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood decimated by the fires — an area that plan administrators considered among its top five exposures to wildfire risk anywhere in the state. Preliminary estimates of the insurance losses total over $10 billion — although Keys expects the total to be far higher. How the FAIR Plan will cope is a warning for the rest of the country, where these kinds of state insurance programs have grown over 200 percent in the last five years. Many don’t have enough set aside to pay claims while taking on enormous risks. In the scorched concrete of the Pacific Coast Highway, where the flames ran all the way to the sand, the limits of what can be insured and what can be rebuilt are emerging with aching clarity. It’s an unwelcome, overdue reckoning. When the wind began on what was still an ordinary Tuesday, Jess Miller tried to reassure herself. She had lived all her life in Altadena, California, a diverse and picturesque suburb north of the city. Her mind instinctively jumped to fire, but she wasn’t especially worried about her own neighborhood. “I figured it would be like always,” she says, “something that would stay up in the mountains, and we’d be OK.” But around dinner, Miller looked out her window and was shocked to see orange flames. The heat rose to meet her when she stepped outside, thick and pressing against her face like a warning. “It’s like the fire could do anything,” she said. They weren’t in an official evacuation zone, but “we knew that it was just time.” She and her husband grabbed their five-year-old daughter and a few essentials and fled, swerving through choking smoke around cars that had been abandoned in place. That night, the house and a studio containing all of Miller’s art burned to the ground. Only the chimney remained. “There’s nothing left,” she says. “You don’t even think about the kinds of things that you grab until it’s too late.” Losing her house is not the end, but the beginning of a frightening financial journey. Miller rented from her father, who had purchased only nominal insurance coverage. Not only is he unlikely to be able to recoup his own full losses, but as a policyholder in the state, he’s on the hook to help bail out insurers themselves. In 2024, Lara made a big change to how the FAIR plan covered its vast liabilities. Previously, if a massive wildfire depleted the program’s funds, it could force private insurance companies operating in the state to cover the gap. But last July, Lara announced that in the “extremely unlikely event” this occurred, insurance companies could shift most of the costs to consumers — a tactic states like Florida and Louisiana have also turned to as their insurer-of-last-resort programs swell. Now, California insurers are allowed to charge half of the first billion dollars of any residential damages they’re asked to pay to policyholders — along with unlimited losses beyond that. With over 12,000 structures destroyed by L.A.’s fires so far, that “extremely unlikely event” is looming. The last time the FAIR Plan assessed insurers was after a 1994 earthquake that rocked L.A. — and almost all the insurers that provided earthquake coverage subsequently left the state. Lara has received significant contributions from the insurance industry, including $270,000 during his initial campaign for insurance commissioner as well as after he took office in 2019. During his reelection bid, he also accepted $125,000 from two LGBTQ groups after they received similar amounts from the insurance industry. (He previously accepted $65,000 of campaign donations from oil and gas companies over the course of his career as a state senator before rejecting efforts to require insurers to disclose their investments in fossil fuels.) According to emails obtained by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog and reviewed by The Lever, in August 2023, Lara’s office shared preliminary ideas for passing insurance costs onto consumers with lobbyists representing the insurers that had backed his campaigns. The emails’ recipients included the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the California Personal Insurance Federation, and lobbyists representing insurance agents and brokers, which together have contributed at least $21,000 to Lara’s political coffers. “He’s made no qualms about developing his plan with the industry and being proud of that,” says Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog. Lara says the FAIR Plan changes are a necessary part of a series of regulatory reforms designed to help keep insurance companies operating in the state. Other reforms included permitting insurers to set rates by using private “catastrophe models” that factor in climate trends and in some cases walking back wildfire-mitigation discounts he’d previously introduced. In return, Lara promised that insurance companies would significantly expand their coverage areas in the state, insuring 85 percent of homeowners in wildfire areas. “For the first time in history, we are requiring insurance companies to expand where people need help the most,” Lara said in a December 2024 statement. “With our changing climate, we can no longer look to the past.” But the regulation’s fine print shows insurers actually have the option to increase their coverage by as little as 5 percent — and even that requirement can be excused if the companies claim they are unable to meet the condition after two years. Advocacy groups say the catastrophe models are expected to increase rates for many property owners, but the state’s Department of Insurance itself failed to conduct a cost analysis. California has hired just one person to oversee the accuracy of the new climate catastrophe models. Florida, in comparison, has a multidisciplinary team of experts to review catastrophe models and compare them to a public version developed by the state. “Administering the FAIR plan properly” would be just one reason for California to develop a more robust analysis, “rather than simply relying on not publicly transparent private-vendor modeling,” says Madison Condon, a professor of law at Boston University who researches climate risk in financial institutions. One of the first catastrophe models filed with the state this winter came from Moody’s RMS, a company that rates the financial stability of insurance companies. Moody’s largest shareholder is the massive holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Moody’s other top shareholders include financial services companies like The Vanguard Group and BlackRock, Inc. — who control substantial investment portfolios for insurance companies and who’ve both left a global agreement to fight climate change. “It creates a bit of financial conflict when the ratings company is selling the tools it wants insurers to use to set rates,” says Consumer Watchdog’s Balber. Insurance companies may feel pressure to buy and use Moody’s model because they are dependent on the company for good credit ratings. If the model overpredicts risks, insurance companies can justify raising rates, increasing profits as well as management fees for BlackRock. “It’s an unvirtuous circle,” Balber says. Commissioner Lara has a history with Berkshire Hathaway. In 2019. Lara held a “relationship building” lunch with company executives benefiting his reelection campaign; after the meeting came to light, Lara was forced to return donations from executives of Berkshire Hathaway-owned companies. Lara later intervened multiple times — including overruling a judge — on behalf of one of those donors, the executive of an underwriting company then owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Not even the fiercest consumer advocates dispute that the climate crisis has radically reshaped the landscape of risk. Scientists say rapidly growing fires like the ones torching Los Angeles have increased almost 250 percent over the past 20 years. But “what the industry has done in California is take those real costs,” Balber says, and “used them to try and leverage deregulation.” There’s a lot of money at stake. Unaccounted-for wildfire and flood risk threatens as much as $2.7 trillion dollars in the U.S. housing market, says David Burt, founder and CEO of DeltaTerra Capital. He estimates that just under one in five homes nationwide are at risk. What to do about all of that unpriced risk would be much easier to figure out with more information. “What we’re missing is the kind of granular, localized data that would allow us to see the impacts on insurance premiums and claims in particular communities,” says Carly Fabian, policy advocate at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. To understand potential disruptions in insurance markets, the Biden administration issued an executive order in 2021 tasking the Treasury Department and the Federal Insurance Office with collecting data on the problem. Insurance companies pushed back, calling it an “unreasonable burden.” The Treasury reversed course, accepting an anonymized subset of the data from state insurance offices — and even that has yet to be made public. “Right now, we actually have less information on insurance than we did about mortgages prior to the 2008 financial crisis,” says Fabian. Just how much insurers are currently losing responding to catastrophes is hard to pin down. There were 27 different billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. in 2024, trailing a record set just the year before. However, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the insurance industry still made a record $87.6 billion in profits in 2023 thanks to higher premiums — and was on track to make even more in 2024. When asked if California’s fires might result in higher homeowner premiums nationally, Fabian explained that insurers already regularly distribute costs. Because the industry is overseen by state governments, there are different rules for rate-setting across the country. Some researchers have found this leads to higher premiums in states with weaker oversight, regardless of the location’s actual risk. “If there isn’t strong regulation,” Fabian says, states are “just relying on a pinky promise that these companies aren’t going to price gouge a product that’s fundamental to the American economy.” She says greater transparency is essential to address the costs of an increasingly perilous world. Nowhere is that information scarcity more obvious than in reinsurance, or the insurance that insurers buy to reduce their own risk. An insurer that covers thousands of homes in a hurricane-prone region like Florida, for example, might take out a reinsurance policy that agrees to pay some of the claims if a storm triggers widespread damage. Starting this month, Lara announced insurance companies would be allowed to pass the costs of their reinsurance on to consumers. Records requests reveal the commissioner’s office hired a consultant from Milliman, a firm that works for the insurance industry, to draft the policy. The change also allows companies to increase their premiums through a calculation that includes catastrophe bond pricing, a volatile security market. There was no opportunity for public comment. In a study last year, Benjamin Keys of the Wharton School used mortgage data to compare insurance premiums across states, a workaround to the persistent information gaps that he says have “allowed a very opaque market.” He found premiums had increased by 33 percent since 2020, mostly due to higher reinsurance costs, along with inflation. Reinsurance is a largely unregulated global market, and insurance companies usually don’t disclose the terms of their contracts. But even with large payouts, reinsurers like Swiss Re and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group made huge profits in 2023 and 2024, with the industry’s total capital hitting a record $695 billion last year. That’s nearly five times more than the world’s largest oil company made in 2023. Passing on reinsurance costs has already contributed to the homeowners’ affordability crisis. Last year, a month after State Farm canceled 70 percent of its policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, the company sought to raise its remaining premiums by 30 percent. While Commissioner Lara said the request raised “serious questions about its financial condition,” the company had quietly been buying hundreds of millions worth of reinsurance it didn’t need from its own parent company, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. According to calculations by Consumer Watchdog, State Farms’s reinsurance costs were markedly worse than other large home insurers in the state. “The company is blaming reinsurance for its pullbacks in the market when we have clear evidence that it’s overpaying,” says Consumer Watchdog’s Balber. State Farm did not respond to interview requests. Nevertheless, in September, Lara approved State Farm’s request to reduce the discounts it offers homeowners for wildfire mitigation and absolved the company from explaining to consumers what factors it uses to determine rates or how it decides whether to cover properties. Yet unlike private insurers like State Farm, the state’s FAIR Plan isn’t required to have the same reserves to cover claims. In public testimony last year, the FAIR Plan’s president told the legislature the program had only about $2.5 billion in reinsurance — which Los Angeles’ fire damage is almost guaranteed to exceed, many times over. Since insurers now have a cap on their obligations, homeowners will be stuck with the difference. If those costs balloon, Crawford asks, “Does the state bail out the FAIR Plan? Does the federal government get asked to come and bail out the states?” As last resort programs metastasize across the country, who’s on the hook to pay for climate damage, and under what conditions, should be decided before the eventual emergency arises. Dave Jones, California’s insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2019, suggests one solution would be a federal reinsurance program, which could provide lower-priced nonprofit reinsurance for last-resort programs. It could be paired, Jones suggests, with federal low-income subsidies similar to the health benefit exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. California Sen. Adam Schiff (D) introduced an even more ambitious bill in Congress last year that would develop a national reinsurance program for all hazards, including for private insurers, in exchange for writing flood coverage that would eventually replace the troubled National Flood Insurance Program. Some kind of major shift in national policies is unavoidable, Jones says. “I do think that we are continuing to march towards an uninsurable future in this country,” he adds, “because we’re not dealing with the root cause of this problem, which is climate change.” It’s increasingly clear the center cannot hold: The odds of floods or fires are already driving down home values in the most vulnerable areas. Meanwhile, rising insurance costs have started to slow sales and cause price declines in risky regions, potentially leading to an escalating financial crisis. Markets like reinsurance may be repricing rapidly, Carnegie’s Crawford says, but other elements of the financial system, like mortgages and credit ratings, may not yet have adequately taken these risks into account. “These places of concentrated risk may, as in the subprime mortgage crisis, be places of concentrated defaults,” she says. Unlike foreclosed condos in Las Vegas, however, the effects of climate change aren’t going to be reversed. Altogether, Crawford says 17 percent of the country’s $48 trillion housing market may be at serious risk of fire or flood, putting the national economy itself at peril. Just this week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 400,000 mortgages in the South are underinsured against flood risk. As a result, Crawford is advocating for major changes in how the National Flood Insurance Program considers future risks and strengthening the program by making flood insurance an opt-out element of obtaining a mortgage, broadening the pool of people paying in. She also recommends incorporating insurance costs into buyers’ mortgage eligibility, which Freddie Mac started doing last year. Government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac help stabilize the housing market by buying and guaranteeing mortgages. Privatizing them, as conservative advocates pushed for in Project 2025, could quickly change how climate risks are priced. Currently, neither enterprise directly accounts for regional differences in climate risk, effectively subsidizing credit in vulnerable areas. That’s in part because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have historically prioritized expanding housing opportunities. But privatization could lead to stricter lending standards in areas prone to disasters, like higher loan costs or more substantial down payments — making it cost more to get a mortgage in vulnerable places like California and Florida. Whatever happens to the country’s mortgage market, accurately pricing insurance may mean accepting that home values will decline as a result, Wharton’s Keys says. “The climate is just changing so much faster than policymakers are keeping up with,” Keys says, “and certainly than the pace at which the built environment can adapt.” Though many people in California live in unprotectable areas, a property value collapse there would likely have substantial effects on a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. “There are similar problems in Florida, Louisiana, coastal Carolinas,” Keys says, pointing to a December Senate report finding climate change is now driving a drop in insurance coverage nationwide, leading to higher prices. Any efforts to address these problems will have to balance short-term disaster relief with the unflinching reality that the climate risks are only going to grow. On Jan. 12, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) suspended the state’s environmental rules for rebuilding in the areas damaged by the L.A. wildfires to hasten reconstruction. But the move does nothing to address perpetuating unsafe land use practices or future climate hazards. “No matter what we do with emissions today, many of these changes are baked in,” Crawford says. Crawford grew up in Santa Monica, and even given her research into climate’s financial impacts, she was shocked to see that her childhood home was under an evacuation warning area during the L.A. fires. “Human beings are masters at self-deception,” she says wryly. “It is unthinkable that your neighborhood would go up in flames, that the place where you just walked your dog no longer exists.” But for Miller — who’s spending the shell-shocked days since losing her house trying to find a place for her family to live — and the other 180,000 people who were displaced in the fires, that unimaginable reality is here. Many of those who return to find their homes damaged but still standing are about to discover that their insurance won’t cover their repairs, says Dylan Schaffer, a partner at Oakland, California-based law firm Kerley Schaffer, which specializes in representing insured homeowners. Schaffer filed a class-action lawsuit last July against the FAIR Plan, alleging it has illegally limited coverage since 2012, denying thousands of families’ claims because it refused to pay for what administrators considered smoke damage. California law requires insurance companies to compensate property owners for “all loss by fire.” But Schaffer says the FAIR plan has been settling claims based on illegally restricted policies. In 2022, the California Department of Insurance itself concluded that FAIR plan policies weren’t meeting state requirements, identifying 418 violations of its insurance code where claims were improperly denied or coverage was impacted. In the two years since then, Schaffer says Lara hasn’t done anything to address the problem. Houses after fires are toxic, Schaffer explains: “Your neighbor’s house, with all its paint cans and televisions and toxins, burns down, and all that debris lands in your house, and the FAIR Plan’s position is, ‘We don’t cover this.’” Los Angeles was already facing a serious housing shortage. The city said in 2021 that it would need to add almost 500,000 units of housing stock, even before the fires wiped out thousands of structures. Without a functional insurance system to help people rebuild, the crisis will only deepen as displaced residents compete for a shrinking supply of affordable homes. “This is the point of the sword,” Schaffer says, “where climate change, economics, politics, and law all meet.” Though many of the houses lost in these fires were palatial — with values far exceeding the FAIR Plan’s $3 million coverage limits — historic Black and working-class neighborhoods were also destroyed. “Folks experiencing homelessness get lost in natural disaster,” says John Maceri, the CEO of the nonprofit The People Concern, an advocacy group working to help unhoused people find temporary housing and stay abreast of evacuation orders. Safe parking areas where people living in vehicles have access to restrooms have been burned out, he explains. Some of the people he helped this week find shelter off the street had been previously displaced by other catastrophic wildfires. Insurance, with its backstop of reinsurance, is a fragile scaffold on which lives are rebuilt, the mechanism that allows people to try to move forward and begin again. But while companies will eventually be spurred by bottom lines to account for climate risks, they are unlikely to consider equity in their response. That’s a problem, Crawford says, because “adaptation is a public good that won’t be adequately provided by the private sector.” While development prospectors may be drawn to cheap lots with a view of the Malibu hills, as homes become less insurable and services disappear, communities will weaken. In the scorched remains, property tax collection will crater, and municipalities won’t have the capital to rebuild infrastructure. It’s unclear how much even the houses still standing in neighborhoods like Altadena will be worth because of the destruction around them. Miller, for one, isn’t sure if she wants to come back to her burned-out home. She doesn’t ever want to be in that sort of situation again. Seeing the charred remains of the neighborhood she grew up in, “I’m homesick for the life I used to have,” she says, choking back tears. “I have to start all over.” We want to hear it.

Robinhood (HOOD) stock is advancing for a second straight day, climbing 9.5% today. HOOD's platform allows investors to buy and sell many types of assets. Bernstein Identified HOOD as a "Best Idea" Wealth management firm Bernstein yesterday picked Robinhood as its "best idea" in the digital assets category. According to the firm, HOOD's crypto business will be boosted by the Trump administration's less onerous regulations. Consequently, Bernstein expects HOOD to be able to "list more tokens and capture a larger share of the spot crypto trading market." As a result, the company should be able to obtain revenue from more sources in the crypto space, Bernstein believes. The wealth management firm kept an Outperform rating and a $51 price target on the name. More Information About HOOD On Jan. 7, JPMorgan upgraded HOOD to Neutral from Underweight. The bank expects trading platforms to benefit from higher interest rates and retail traders' elevated enthusiasm level. Of the 17 Street analysts who have released notes about HOOD in the last 90 days, 12 have had Strong Buy or Buy ratings on the name. The Price Action of HOOD Stock In the last month, the shares have climbed 23%, while they have soared 70% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of HOOD, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HOOD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on Abbott Laboratories (ABT): ‘Not Understood Very Well Because They’re Doing Tremendous Stuff When It Comes To Diabetes. People Don’t Seem To Care’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks. In one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, "Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming." He shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. "House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter," Cramer remarked. He added "What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough." Another news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could "be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal." One person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. "I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top," believes Cramer. He added "We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state." On the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months "Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership," he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes "you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow." Finally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared "I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified." Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated "I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63 Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the biggest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world. The firm's shares are flat year-to-date and they closed 2024 just 3.8% higher. While the broader pharmaceutical industry didn't perform well last year due to interest rates and inflationary pressures, some of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)'s struggles were specific to the firm. The firm was ordered to pay $495 million in damages related to its infant formula in July. The stock soared by 4.6% in November after a jury cleared it of liability. Here's what Cramer said about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT): "Abbott, not understood very well because they're doing tremendous stuff when it comes to diabetes. People don't seem to care." Overall ABT ranks 7th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of ABT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Abbott (ABT) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) fell sharply last year as a combination of declining vaccine demand, headwinds on consumer discretionary spending, and misguided acquisitions led to a series of dismal earnings reports from the company. As a result, Walgreens was forced to cut its dividend, took a multibillion-dollar impairment charge, and lost its place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI). Walgreens fell steadily through the first three quarters of the year as the company missed estimates and cut guidance, and Wall Street's view of the stock soured. CPAY's commitment to shareholder value is evident in its consistent share repurchase program. Buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a good strategy is incredibly hard.

Title: TikTok Plans ‘Immediate’ Shutdown of App in U.S. on Jan. 19 If Supreme Court Doesn’t Block Ban: Reports
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/tiktok-immediate-shutdown-jan-19-supreme-court-ban-1236274933/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok is preparing to go dark for U.S. users this Sunday if the Supreme Court does not grant its emergency appeal to halt a law that will ban the app unless Chinese parent ByteDance divests its stake, according to reports. TikTok is in danger of being banned in the U.S. under a federal law set to take effect Sunday, Jan. 19, unless the Supreme Court grants an injunction blocking it. On Wednesday, the court did not issue a ruling in the matter. At this point, TikTok plans an “immediate” shut down of the app for U.S. users unless the Supreme Court grants a reprieve, The Information reported, citing anonymous sources. Reuters also reported on TikTok’s preparations to suspend service for American users in the absence of a favorable Supreme Court ruling.

In addition, TikTok plans to give users an option to download their data, according to the report. Popular on Variety TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. In a message sent to staffers Tuesday, TikTok’s HR chief said U.S. employees will continue to have their jobs even if the app ban goes into effect, as reported by the New York Times. “Your employment, pay and benefits are secure, and our offices will remain open, even if this situation hasn’t been resolved before the January 19 deadline,” TikTok global head of HR Nicky Raghavan said in the message. “The bill is not written in a way that impacts the entities through which you are employed, only the U.S. user experience.” On Friday, Jan. 10, the Supreme Court heard arguments in TikTok’s emergency appeal seeking to block the law, with TikTok and ByteDance arguing that the law violates First Amendment rights of its 170 million U.S. users. The justices seemed to lean toward being more receptive to the government’s position — that TikTok represents a national security threat, as it falls under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communist Party. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. Chinese officials have been exploring the potential for ByteDance to sell its stake to tech mogul Elon Musk, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported this week. A TikTok spokesperson called that “pure fiction.” The law passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed by President Biden in April 2024. U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to spread pro-China propaganda. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, prohibits Apple and Google’s app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok in the U.S. unless ByteDance sells its ownership stake in the app to any party located in a country that is not designated a “foreign adversary” of the United States.

Title: In Larry Fink's 100th earnings call, the BlackRock CEO spoke about private markets and retirement — but not his own

At least one thing remains the same from when BlackRock went public a quarter of a century ago: Larry Fink's pre-earnings call dinner. Fink, speaking on his 100th earnings call Wednesday, said — despite the many changes to the firm and the world over the past 25 years — he has had a bowl of cereal with blueberries the night before each call. Now, with $11.6 trillion in assets and a record $641 billion in net inflows in 2024, BlackRock is looking toward private markets for its next evolution. "This just the beginning," Fink said. The firm hopes to close its acquisition of private credit giant HPS in the second quarter, he said and has already integrated infrastructure investor GIP. Data platform Preqin — which BlackRock is set to buy for $3.2 billion — will make the private markets more accessible, Fink said, because of its data and analytics capabilities. Altogether, the biggest opportunity for the firm is taking these strategies downmarket to individual retirement plans and managed account models. Private market players are anticipating that the incoming Trump administration, which has promised a deregulatory push, to allow private equity and credit assets into pension plans such as 401ks. The ideal portfolio blend, Fink said, is no longer the 60-40 portfolio of stocks and bonds that was the standard for so long. Alternatives are needed to diversify properly, and BlackRock plans to offer them. There's close to $10 trillion in money-market funds Fink expects will "be put to work" soon, and "income-oriented products" like private credit and infrastructure investments should be at the top of the list. While he's hoping to get private markets strategies into 401ks, Fink did not address his own potential retirement. Mark Wiedman, a potential successor to Fink, is leaving the asset manager. Fink said on the call that Wiedman's departure was discussed for months and he will stay on through the spring to help with the transition. "Rob and I are proud of the deep leadership team at BlackRock," he said, referring to firm president Rob Kapito. He said talent is "the most important thing we invest in each and every year," stating that a new generation of leaders is being developed. Those new leaders will be the ones who will determine what BlackRock's next 25 years look like and where it will grow next. They just need to be careful not to blink. "It goes by quick," said Bill Katz, TD Cowen's analyst, on the call, reminiscing about covering BlackRock's IPO. Jump to

The outcome of the shutdown would be different from that mandated by the law. The law would mandate a ban only on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores, while existing users could continue using it for some time. Under TikTok's plan, people attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, they said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The Information first reported the news. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as Blackrock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden had in April last year signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from President-elect Donald Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. Trump, whose inauguration takes place the day after the law goes into effect, has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in a court filing last month it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using its app would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasts a month. Got a confidential news tip?

Business :Aligned Data Centers, which specializes in AI-related infrastructure, said on Wednesday it had completed another round of capital raise of more than $12 billion. Artificial intelligence requires enormous computing power, pushing demand for specialized data centers that enable technology companies to link thousands of chips together in clusters. The capital raise includes $5 billion of new primary equity — comprising funds managed by Macquarie Asset Management — and more than $7 billion of new debt commitments. Plano, Texas-based Aligned said that the proceeds from the capital raise will be used in the development of its planned future capacity of over 5 gigawatts across Canada, North America and Latin America. The enormous uptake of AI, both in business and personal use, has prompted a host of companies, from startups to bellwether companies like Microsoft and Blackrock, to invest in AI data centers. In September, the two companies said that they plan to launch a more than $30 billion fund to invest in AI infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. Earlier this month, Microsoft said that it is planning to pledge about $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on developing data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications. Crusoe, another AI infrastructure provider, secured $600 million in a late-stage funding round last month, valuing the startup at $2.8 billion.

01/15 update below. This post was originally published on January 14 Bitcoin and crypto prices have bounced back, with bitcoin surging toward $100,000 after a sudden downturn sparked fears of a crypto crash. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price rocketed higher in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory in November, with Trump last month confirming he's planning to drop a bitcoin price bombshell. Now, as the Federal Reserve braces for a looming crisis, Trump, the self-styled crypto president, will reportedly issue several crypto-related executive orders on his first day back in the White House, January 20—with one predicted to spark a huge bitcoin price boom. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Incoming U.S. president Donald Trump has reportedly made it priority to issue several bitcoin and ... [+] crypto executive orders—predicted to send the bitcoin price soaring. Trump's day-one executive orders may address issues including de-banking and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding bitcoin and crypto to count them as liabilities on the bank's own balance sheet. "The Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority," an anonymous source told the Washington Post. 01/15 update: Bitcoin has surged following the latest U.S. data that showed headline prices climbed as expected but core inflation, striping out food and fuel, came in slightly below predictions. The bitcoin price has rocketed toward $100,000 per bitcoin, almost entirely erasing its early January decline. The inflation data means the Federal Reserve may be more inclined than previously thought to reduce interest rates through 2025, feeding risk assets such as bitcoin with increased liquidity. "Bitcoin is also currently undergoing a local test as its price surpasses the $97,000 mark," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in comments ahead of the inflation data drop. "It is now challenging the 50-day moving average from below, a level it dropped beneath just over a week ago. The rally, with global equity indices relatively neutral, indicates a gradual recovery in risk appetite." The bitcoin price recovery from a dip last week, may now have "run its course," according to Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, who maintained his bullish bitcoin price prediction for 2025 in an emailed note. "We would recommend accumulating longs again," Kendrick wrote. "We continue to target bitcoin at the $200,000 level by end-2025 as institutional inflows resume under the Trump administration." The mysterious, unconfirmed so-called "Operation ChokePoint 2.0"—named for a similar, 2013 U.S. Department of Justice policy to de-bank legal industries deemed to be high risk for fraud and money laundering—has weighed on crypto companies through the Biden administration, with founders and executives claiming financial regulators have pressured banks to cut off crypto companies from financial services. The issue was recently catapulted into mainstream consciousness by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. Andreessen, who has backed many tech and crypto companies at the VC company known as a16z and is an associate of Trump's so-called crypto czar David Sacks, is reportedly working with Trump’s incoming administration behind the scenes. Meanwhile, crypto companies led by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor have been campaigning against the policy that requires companies to report crypto as a liability, a result of a March 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff accounting bulletin, SAB121. The repeal of SAB121 is one of the three catalysts Saylor said would trigger a bitcoin price rally to $5 million—giving bitcoin a total market capitalization of $100 trillion.

Last year, Saylor, who has transformed his software company into a bitcoin-buying vehicle over the last five years, said during an X broadcast that the repeal of SAB121 will help "take us to $5 million a coin" as companies and financial institutions begin buying bitcoin. "The other two [catalysts named by Salyor] have already happened (spot [exchange-traded funds] ETFs and fair value accounting)," Julian Fahrer, the chief executive of bitcoin rewards company Apollo, posted to X. Last year, the world's largest asset manager BlackRock led a Wall Street rush into the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs, with its IBIT bitcoin fund becoming one of the fastest growing ETFs of all time as traders piled in. In November, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) officially adopted fair value accounting for bitcoin, allowing companies to more accurately reflect bitcoin's current market value in their financial statements.

Title: BlackRock CEO predicts decade-long recovery from Los Angeles wildfires
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-ceo-predicts-decadelong-recovery-from-los-angeles-wildfires-93CH-3814203

Full Content:
Investing.com -- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).'s Chief Executive Officer, Larry Fink, has projected that the recovery from the recent wildfires in Los Angeles could take up to a decade. The fires, which have been active for a week and are still largely uncontrolled, have caused extensive damage, leading to a rethink of homeowners’ insurance policies over the next four years. Fink, himself a Los Angeles native, said during an interview with CNBC that these fires might necessitate a redefinition of event risk in various parts of the country. He emphasized that homeowners’ insurance is increasingly becoming a significant aspect of home ownership, especially in light of such large-scale destruction. The BlackRock CEO's comments were made public following the company's announcement of its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. He pointed out that the wildfires have not only destroyed entire neighborhoods but also essential infrastructure, schools, and supermarkets. Fink stressed that the recovery from such widespread damage is not a quick fix, predicting a recovery period of five to ten years. Insurance losses from the wildfires are currently estimated to be as high as $40 billion. The National Weather Service has warned that parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties will continue to face "extreme fire danger" at least until Wednesday afternoon local time. However, conditions are expected to improve slightly on Thursday as the winds shift. The wildfires have resulted in at least 24 fatalities and have incinerated entire neighborhoods. Describing the ongoing fires as "horrible to watch," Fink's predictions underscore the long-term implications of these devastating wildfires on homeowners and the insurance industry.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) stands against the other dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have always been a go-to choice for investors, no matter how frequently they receive payouts. Companies carefully decide how often to reward their shareholders. While annual or semi-annual dividends can offer larger sums, their unpredictability can leave investors in a bit of a pickle. Most major firms stick to quarterly payouts for practical reasons, but some opt for monthly distributions, which many investors find appealing as they provide a steady flow of passive income. Monthly payouts offer immediate cash flow, helping with day-to-day financial management. Moreover, a cut in monthly dividends would have a smaller immediate impact, making them feel almost like a regular paycheck. However, history shows that while companies offering monthly dividends may offer higher yields, they sometimes fall short on maintaining consistent dividend policies. Regardless of how often they are paid, dividend stocks have delivered impressive returns over the years. Investors often aim to reduce risk in their portfolios, and dividend stocks offer a dependable way to do so. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices underscored the growing importance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over the years, dividend income has consistently increased, rising from 2.68% in late 1980 to 7.88% by mid-2024. In contrast, interest income has declined, falling from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same timeframe. Analysts also suggest adding dividend stocks to portfolios due to the advantages they offer. Savita Subramanian, an equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Corp., also recommended that investors increase their holdings of dividend stocks. Here are some comments from the analyst: “You want to be in safe dividends — and I know this is the most boring call of all time, but sometimes boring is good. We believe that we are now in a total return world in which the contribution of dividends to total market returns could be significantly higher than it was in the last decade, a period marked by falling cash yields and lofty price returns. We advise investors to seek out companies with above-market and secure (not stretched) dividend yields.” Within dividend strategy, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that regularly boost their dividends, prompting many firms to focus on sustaining and growing these payments, even in tough economic times. This approach has proven effective, as companies with a track record of dividend growth have yielded impressive long-term returns. A report by Cohen & Steers highlighted that from 2000 to 2010, dividend-paying firms outperformed their non-paying counterparts by an annual margin of 620 basis points, while also experiencing significantly lower risk, as indicated by standard deviation. Over a 30-year period ending in 2011, the advantages of dividend-paying companies became even clearer, with those initiating or increasing dividends consistently outperforming both other dividend-payers and non-payers, delivering higher returns with less volatility. Although dividend stocks underperformed in 2024, their outlook remains promising. Analysts expect a strong rebound for these stocks, especially with the addition of several major tech companies to the dividend-paying ranks, signaling potential growth in this sector. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends. Our Methodology: For this article, we looked through a list of companies that pay monthly dividends and picked those with yields above 5% as of January 14. While analysts don't usually recommend stocks with extremely high dividend yields because they may indicate financial issues, we chose companies with a consistent history of stable dividends despite their high yields. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Dividend Yield as of January 14: 15.58% AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) is an American real estate investment trust company that mainly invests in residential mortgage-backed securities. The company's net spread and dollar roll income per share, which is the key metric for assessing its profits, decreased over the past year due to a sluggish mortgage market and slower-than-expected interest rate cuts by the Fed. However, its tangible net book value per share increased year-over-year as the value of its underlying investments rose. Despite the associated risks, AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) is still a solid investment. As a mortgage REIT, it invests in mortgages that have been packaged into bond-like securities, rather than owning properties and leasing them to tenants like most REITs. In some respects, it operates like a mutual fund, with the company's value being tied to the value of its mortgage securities portfolio. In addition, as of June 30, 2024, the company’s investment portfolio was valued at $66.0 billion. This portfolio comprised $59.7 billion in Agency MBS, $5.3 billion in net forward purchases or sales of Agency MBS in the "to-be-announced" market, and $1.0 billion in credit risk transfer (CRT) and non-Agency securities, along with other mortgage credit investments. AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders since it went public in 2008. The company shifted to monthly payments in 2014. Since 2008, it has returned $13.4 billion to shareholders through dividends. It pays a monthly dividend of $0.12 per share and has a dividend yield of 15.58%, as of January 14. AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) was popular among elite funds in Q3 2024 with 24 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, up from 19 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes have a consolidated value of more than $230.3 million. With over 12 million shares, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall AGNC ranks 3rd on our list of the best monthly dividend stocks with over 5% yield. While we acknowledge the potential of AGNC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AGNC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta's performance-based cuts could kick off a wider trend in tech
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-mark-zuckerberg-plan-fire-low-performers-tech-trend-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-15T12:28:47Z
Full Content:
Hello there! Business Insider's Alistair Barr thought he was doing the right thing when he discouraged a colleague from joining a little-known startup back in 2016. Turns out he was wrong. Really wrong. The startup was OpenAI, and the former colleague, who thankfully didn't listen, is now an AI billionaire. In today's big story, Meta is looking to quickly get rid of low performers with companywide cuts as it prepares for what Mark Zuckerberg says will be an "intense year." What's on deck Markets: The saga of finding Jamie Dimon's replacement takes another twist. Tech: Microsoft employees across multiple divisions have been laid off. Business: President-elect Donald Trump announces plans for an external revenue service. But first, on the chopping block. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tired: Move fast and break things. Wired: Move fast and get rid of underperformers. Two years after Mark Zuckerberg's famous "Year of Efficiency" the Meta CEO is ratcheting things up a notch. The tech giant announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce with a focus on the lowest performers, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann and Hugh Langley report. Based on Meta's most-recent earnings report, that would amount to about 3,600 roles. In a memo to staff, Zuckerberg said the company is entering an "intense year" and the decision was made to "move out low-performers faster." So how does Meta plan on doing that? Jyoti and Pranav Dixit got their hands on an internal memo from a human-resources executive explaining how the job cuts will work. The key is reaching a 5% non-regrettable attrition rate this year. In case you don't speak HR mumbo jumbo, that describes workers Meta wouldn't mind losing. To get there, Meta managers will need to identify 12-15% of employees with performance ratings of "Met Most Expectations" or worse. Those who receive ratings of "Met Some" and "Did not Meet" will definitely be fired while those with a "Met Most" rating will be further evaluated by a director and VP before a decision is made. They won't have a lot of time to do it. Employees based in the US will find out about the cuts by February 10. Meta employees had plenty of questions about the strategy. Some got behind the idea. One wrote on an internal message board viewed by Jyoti and Hugh that "there is a need to raise the bar and I absolutely support this." Others, however, weren't as optimistic. Some wondered how — dare I say — efficient the process would be. The process is "marginally better than 'monkey's throwing darts,'" another employee wrote. Like it or not, it might be here to stay. An internal FAQ document viewed by BI hints that performance-related layoffs could become an annual tradition at Meta. The bigger question is whether the approach catches on at other companies. You could argue Zuckerberg's 2023 efficiency push kicked off a wider trend. (Or maybe it was bound to happen anyway.) Regular performance-based cuts aren't the standard in tech like they are in other industries, but they also aren't unheard of. Amazon, in particular, has leaned on performance-improvement plans in recent years. 1. Crypto might be a lot of things, but a currency isn't one of them. For all the attention digital currencies like bitcoin have gotten over the years, the likelihood they'll replace money (as some predicted) still seems farfetched. BI's Adam Rogers writes about how crypto has just become another way for people to gamble. 2. JPMorgan and BlackRock shake-up their executive ranks. Daniel Pinto, the bank's president and COO, will step down in June and plans to retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak, currently a co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, will replace Pinto as COO. The promotion isn't about CEO Jamie Dimon grooming a successor, though. Piepszak doesn't want the top job, leading to more questions about Dimon's succession plans. Meanwhile, the race to succeed another Wall Street titan — BlackRock's Larry Fink — took a turn with the departure of Mark Wiedman, who was widely viewed as a top candidate for the job. 3. What the Los Angeles wildfires mean for the economy. AccuWeather estimates the total economic cost could reach $275 billion. Goldman Sachs says it could rank as one of the costliest natural disasters as a share of GDP in US history. However, the bank isn't concerned about higher insurance costs meaningfully impacting inflation. In the meantime, here's a rundown on who could foot the enormous bill. 1. TikTok's fate hangs in the balance. US users are flocking to the Chinese app RedNote, and TikTok Shop sellers are testing out other e-marketplaces. Selling the app to an American owner isn't out of the question, though — there are reports that Chinese officials are considering an eleventh-hour sale to Elon Musk. MuskTok? Sure, why not. 2. Apple takes a hit despite launching AI iPhones. The tech giant had a standout 2024 with the debut of Apple Intelligence and the Vision Pro. However, its global market share of smartphone sales slipped due to the iPhone losing ground to competitors and its new AI feature not being available in Greater China — one of the company's major markets. 3. Exclusive: Layoffs sweep Microsoft. Employees in security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming faced job cuts, two people familiar with the matter told BI. The layoffs are separate from the recent cuts targeting low-performers within the company, which BI previously reported. 1. Justin Baldoni's New York Times lawsuit could hinge on an emoji. The "It Ends With Us" director accused the paper of taking his publicists' quotes out of context. He said the paper omitted an emoji — an upside-down smile — that would've made it clear his publicist was being sarcastic, not serious. 2. Trump's got tax plans, but Congress holds the strings. The president-elect vowed to create an "external revenue service" to collect tariffs and revenue from foreign nations on Day One. It's not clear how the new agency would work, but establishing it would require congressional approval. Back home, Americans could see their tax bills change this year since Trump's 2017 package is set to expire. 3. Come for the coffee, stay for the refills. Starbucks announced all its customers — not just rewards members — can get free refills of many brewed coffee and tea drinks at participating stores starting January 27. But the freebies end there, as the company is closing the door on its open-door policy that allows non-paying guests to use store facilities. Gold is one of the 'least effective' inflation hedges, according to Goldman Sachs. Here are three investments that actually protect your portfolio.

Title: Tech workers earn thousands recommending strangers for jobs

TL;DR: A time-honored practice in corporate recruitment has been tapping into the networks of current employees for new talent. Now, a new trend is emerging, one that is shaking up this traditional approach while giving rise to an underground market where job seekers connect with anonymous company insiders willing to provide that coveted foot in the door. Why would an employee risk their reputation by participating in such a scheme? Simple. Bloomberg tells of one resourceful tech worker who, over the course of 18 months, managed to recommend more than a thousand job candidates to his employer, resulting in several successful hires and approximately $30,000 in referral bonuses. Nearly every person he endorsed was a complete stranger. It is easy to understand how this trend caught on. With job searches becoming increasingly prolonged and resumes seemingly disappearing into the void, applicants are seeking any advantage they can find. The power of a referral cannot be overstated. According to hiring platform Greenhouse, external applicants face a daunting 1 in 200 chance of being hired, while those with referrals see their odds improve significantly to 1 in 25. Internal applicants, though rare, enjoy the best odds at 1 in 5. Several platforms have emerged to facilitate these anonymous referrals. Blind, a free app used by millions of tech workers, hosts forums where job seekers can post about specific roles or companies. Verified employees can then offer to provide referrals, typically through direct messages. Glassdoor's referrals forum operates similarly, catering to finance and consulting roles in addition to tech. For those willing to pay, platforms like Refer Me and Refermarket offer more structured services. Refer Me charges $12 a month for unlimited referral requests, while Refermarket charges between $3 and $50 per request, depending on the user's plan. ReferralHub takes a different approach, allowing insiders to set their own prices. Current listings range from $10 for a ServiceNow referral to $50 for ByteDance, with companies like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Spotify falling in the $20 to $25 range. The popularity of these services is evident, with Microsoft referrals on ReferralHub reportedly being sold over 200 times at $25 each. Refermarket, founded by a laid-off California tech worker in 2023, has amassed 10,000 users, with about a third opting for premium subscriptions. The platform's user base is about 60 percent based in India, with the remainder mainly based in the US. While these platforms claim their practices are legitimate and call them as "courtesy referrals," some companies disagree. Goldman Sachs explicitly stated that such unapproved referral activity violates their code of conduct. Google emphasized that referrals must be based on personal knowledge of candidates from immediate networks and are subject to the same vetting process as other applicants. Human resources professionals are taking notice. Jenny Dearborn, chief people strategy officer at BTS, recounted to Bloomberg how a previous employer simply began ignoring referrals from an employee who was submitting hundreds per quarter. Nolan Church, CEO of FairComp, warned that while job seekers have little to lose, employees risk damaging their most valuable asset: their reputation.

Assets managed by the New York-based company increased to $11.55 trillion from $10.01 trillion a year earlier and $11.48 trillion in the third quarter. Client assets were buoyed by a U.S. stock market rally after Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November, with investors betting on lower corporate taxes and deregulation. BlackRock's quarterly results complete a banner year for the asset manager, which has sought to strengthen its position in rapidly growing private markets, spending about $25 billion last year on infrastructure investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners and private credit business HPS Investment Partners. "For many companies, periods of M&A contribute to a pause in client engagement. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement on Wednesday. Net income rose to $1.67 billion, or $10.63 per share, in the three months to Dec. 31 from $1.38 billion, or $9.15 per share, a year earlier. BlackRock registered $201 billion in long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter. Total net inflows hit $281.4 billion, up from $95.6 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), at $142.6 billion. Clients poured in $23.8 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Assets under management mainly depend on two factors - the performance of investments, and money flowing in and out of the funds. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year up 23.3%, marking its second straight year of gains exceeding 20%. Elsewhere, the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.2% in the fourth quarter but finished up 15.7% in 2024, marking its second straight yearly gain. "Strong asset inflows this quarter contributed to a record-setting year for BLK," said Kyle Sanders, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones. This, he said, "should boost investor confidence that the long-awaited great rotation, where investors move off the sidelines and start to 're-risk' by investing in equity and fixed income products, is beginning to materialize." Shares of the company were up 2% in premarket trading. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackRock posted a 21% fourth quarter jump in profit after buoyant equity markets increased income from fees and drove its assets to a record high of $11.6 trillion, the world's largest money manager said on Wednesday. Assets managed by the New York-based company increased to $11.55 trillion from $10.01 trillion a year earlier and $11.48 trillion in the third quarter. The growth was partly driven by a U.S. stock market rally after Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November prompted investors to bet on lower corporate taxes and deregulation. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s quarterly results complete a banner year for the asset manager, which has sought to strengthen its position in rapidly growing private markets. It spent about $25 billion last year on infrastructure investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners and private credit business HPS Investment Partners. "For many companies, periods of M&A contribute to a pause in client engagement. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement on Wednesday. Net income rose to $1.67 billion, or $10.63 per share, in the three months to Dec. 31 from $1.38 billion, or $9.15 per share, a year earlier. BlackRock registered $201 billion in long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter. Total (EPA:TTEF) net inflows hit $281.4 billion, up from $95.6 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), at $142.6 billion. Clients poured $23.8 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year up 23.3%, marking its second straight year of gains exceeding 20%. "Strong asset inflows this quarter contributed to a record-setting year for BLK," said Kyle Sanders, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones. This, he said, "should boost investor confidence that the long-awaited great rotation, where investors move off the sidelines and start to 're-risk' by investing in equity and fixed income products, is beginning to materialize." Shares of the company were up nearly 4% at $1,000 in early trading on Wednesday. 'NOT FEELING ANY OLDER' BlackRock in June struck a $3.2 billion deal to acquire UK data provider Preqin as it seeks to offer indexes for private markets. Initially, BlackRock anticipated finalizing the Preqin deal by the end of 2024, but Britain's competition regulator last month launched a probe into the transaction and has set Feb. 12 as the deadline for a decision on the first leg of that review. BlackRock's Chief Financial Officer Martin Small said on Wednesday he now expected the deal to close in the first quarter of 2025, while the HPS deal should close within the first half. BlackRock's private markets buying spree may not be over, with the asset manager expected to opportunistically expand further in private credit, real estate, infrastructure, or possibly private equity, Reuters has reported. In a CNBC interview on Wednesday, though, Fink said it was unlikely the company would buy whole companies. Separately, and confirming earlier reports, Fink also said on Wednesday BlackRock senior executive Mark Wiedman, previously touted as a possible Fink successor, is leaving. Fink added many leaders were taking on new, expanded roles. Wiedman said in an email he would stay with the firm for the next few months and then work out his next move. Another executive, Salim Ramji, left BlackRock in January 2024 and went on to become the CEO of asset management company Vanguard Group. Ramji was also once touted as a potential successor to Fink, who is 72 years old. BlackRock's earnings call on Wednesday was Fink's 100th. "I can't say I feel any older," he said.
