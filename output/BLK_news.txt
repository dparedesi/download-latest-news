Title: Why BlackRock’s move could bring Ethereum’s $3K price closer than ever!

BlackRock is the prophet; is its $50 million buy the prophecy signaling Ethereum’s $3k destiny? Among mega-cap assets, Ethereum [ETH] stands out as one of the few still holding onto its May gains, currently trading over 3% above its early-May levels. But this resilience isn’t accidental. Instead, it appears to be part of a calculated allocation strategy by BlackRock. You see, over the past ten days alone, the firm has deployed $50 million into ETH. For an institution built on performance, such capital deployment isn’t speculative. Could this, then, be a signal that BlackRock is positioning ahead of a broader market repricing, with Ethereum’s once-distant $3k target now within striking distance? In less than a week, nearly $700 million slipped out of BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] spot treasury (IBIT), with one day alone seeing almost half a billion in outflows. But it’s not just the ETF, BlackRock also liquidated approximately 5,400 BTC, amounting to a substantial $56 billion sell-off on the 30th of May. Consequently, this significant unwind contributed to heightened market volatility, triggering risk-off sentiment that pushed BTC to retrace back to $100k by the 5th of June. Naturally, one would expect Ethereum to mirror this downturn, especially with millions wiped from derivatives. However, ETH demonstrated relative resilience, limiting losses to 6.8% compared to BTC’s double-digit decline. In fact, ETH settled into a tight trading range, indicating reduced volatility and more stable price dynamics relative to Bitcoin. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) As previously mentioned, this resilience isn’t a fluke. Instead, this stability aligns with strategic capital flows. Beyond BlackRock’s direct accumulation, its Ethereum ETF (ETHA) recorded nearly $319 million in inflows over the past week, marking the first sustained weekly inflows since the November 2024 rally. According to AMBCrypto, such consistent demand signals a deliberate strategic allocation. Hence, reinforcing BlackRock’s positioning in Ethereum as a part of a broader, data-driven investment thesis. Given the scale of BlackRock’s investment, it’s a fair question to ask – Does the world’s largest asset manager see something the broader market is missing? Ethereum’s on-chain and market structure data suggest so. Right now, ETH supply on cold wallets is at a 7-year low. At the same time, over 340,000 ETH are sitting in the staking queue, waiting to be locked up for yield. So we’ve got less ETH circulating, and more getting sidelined. Then there’s the derivatives market. In May, ETH open interest exploded past $35 billion, even higher than during the last bull market peak. Source: Coinglass Put it all together, and it looks like BlackRock is betting on a structural supply squeeze. With more ETH being locked for staking, long-term holds, or leveraged futures, the amount available for trading keeps shrinking, and that’s exactly where their thesis might be taking shape. In turn, making the elusive $3k target look a lot closer, and turning Ethereum’s current consolidation into a strong setup for a potential breakout.

CurveBlock leads the charge as the first real estate development firm in the UK Digital Securities Sandbox. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Public PoW blockchain Kadena makes its first capital deployment from a $50 million grants program, backing UK startup CurveBlock in the Bank of England’s Digital Securities Sandbox. Kadena has awarded the first grant from its new $50 million ecosystem fund, allocating $400,000 to CurveBlock, a UK-based startup building tokenized real estate inside a regulated financial sandbox. The milestone marks a pivotal intersection between open blockchain infrastructure and government-led experimentation with digital securities, underscoring growing institutional appetite for compliant pathways into tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). CurveBlock is the first real estate firm accepted into the UK’s Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), a joint initiative of the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority. The DSS allows blockchain-native financial instruments to operate under modified CSD and exchange rules through 2028, enabling the issuance, trading, and settlement of digital securities with relaxed regulatory constraints. Kadena’s grant is the first deployment from its newly expanded $50 million program, half of which ($25M) is explicitly earmarked for RWA tokenization. The initiative is designed to support builders working on tokenized debt, real estate, and other compliant asset rails, with applicants eligible for equity-free funding, infrastructure support, and code review. CurveBlock’s grant reflects growing interest in aligning public blockchain tech with real-world institutional demand. “Our Grants Program and token standards are essential to enabling compliant, scalable tokenization,” said Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena. “We’re doubling down on ecosystem real-world use cases institutions need.” The DSS launched in late 2024 and represents one of the world’s most advanced attempts at legally enabling digital securities experimentation. Participating firms can scale projects through a series of regulatory gates. CurveBlock recently cleared Gate 1 with support from Kadena and will continue testing live real estate tokenization flows over the coming months. Annelise Osborne, Kadena’s Chief Business Officer and former Moody’s executive, believes that a lack of infrastructure, not institutional interest, is the real bottleneck for RWA adoption. “With this $25 million, I really hope we’ll have a lot more builders and a lot more fintechs that come from the tokenization side… I’m a huge believer that they’re going to grow,” she told American Banker. Osborne has also noted the importance of proof-of-work infrastructure, like Kadena’s Chainweb, in delivering scalable and secure tokenization rails. Kadena’s approach differs from many rivals in that it combines parallelized PoW chains with upcoming EVM compatibility and a token standard designed for compliance. The grant program’s broader goal is to accelerate the adoption of this infrastructure for real-world applications, particularly where on-chain permissioning and regulatory controls are critical. The real estate tokenization market alone is projected to grow to $19.4 billion by 2033, with recent months seeing a 260% surge in overall RWA market cap to $23 billion. Institutions including Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and BlackRock are actively piloting tokenized securities, suggesting that demand for compliant blockchain rails is no longer hypothetical. Kadena’s grant to CurveBlock is a notable signal that public-chain infrastructure may yet play a central role in that evolution. If successful, the experiment could shape not just the future of tokenized real estate in the UK, but also influence US and EU approaches to sandbox-based digital finance.

Title: BTC, Ether, XRP, Solana, USDT, RLUSD — Social Media is Going Crazy for These 6 Crypto Assets, Here’s Why
URL: https://zycrypto.com/btc-ether-xrp-solana-usdt-rlusd-social-media-is-going-crazy-for-these-6-crypto-assets-heres-why/

The week ended on a promising note for several cryptocurrencies as social sentiments turned positive this Thursday. According to data from the on-chain analytical platform Santiment, market participants are collectively expressing excitement about several crypto assets, notably BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, USDT, and RLUSD. Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin appears to be trending due to an increase in bullish BTC price predictions despite the asset’s drop to $100,000, treasury acquisition by leading companies, and new Spot Bitcoin ETF filings, among other reasons. Notably, President Trump’s Truth Social announced the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, with excerpts of the filing noting that “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust.” Similarly, conversations regarding ETH and the Ethereum blockchain highlight its staking security model and rising institutional interest rates, with key players like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity backing ETH. Right behind ETH, XRP, and SOL are now leading altcoin-based conversations. While cross-border payment discourse and institutional adoption by Ripple partners are making up a huge part of the ongoing discussions for XRP, the recent move by a Chinese-based firm, Webus, to raise $300 million for an XRP treasury plan has become a trending topic. On the other hand, Solana’s high transaction speed and significant Total Value Locked (TVL), the Layer-1 blockchain and its native token SOL have earned it a spot in the conversation pit this week, with traders and investors showing keen interest in SOL. Ripple’s RLUSD and Tether’s USD are stablecoins heating up this week. The RLUSD stablecoin can successfully be embedded into Ripple’s UAE and Dubai-based global payment networks upon regulatory approval. Similarly, the USDT has been mentioned along with several futures platforms, including KuCoin, ByBit, Binance Futures, and OKX, with market participants anticipating mass adoption in the long term.

Title: Binaryx Platform Announces Global Expansion as Real Estate Tokenization Accelerates Toward $16 Trillion Market

June 09, 2025 10:45 ET | Source: Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC London, UK, June 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Binaryx, a fractional real estate investing platform, is announcing its move to commercial scale following a successful pilot phase. With $4.4 million in processed investments, with a second-by-second payment of dividends to investors, and 25 tokenized properties launched, Binaryx is contributing to the broader shift toward real estate tokenization — a market projected to unlock $16 trillion in value by 2030. According to a recent statement by Boston Consulting Group, asset tokenization could unlock a $16 trillion market by 2030, with real estate expected to comprise a substantial share of that value. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly endorsed tokenization as “the next generation for markets,” while Citi calls it “the future of assets” in its 2023 Money, Tokens and Games report. But why real estate? And why now? Real Estate: The Ideal On-Ramp to the Token Economy While tokenization has been applied to everything from art and carbon credits to equities and treasuries, real estate stands out as uniquely suited for this transition. Why? Because it checks every box for blockchain-enhanced ownership: Tokenization offers a solution to many of real estate’s pain points — reducing the capital required to participate, opening up cross-border investment flows, and enabling secondary market liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. According to JPMorgan’s 2025 statement on Blockchain’s role in commercial real estate, “Many people avoid real estate because of the upfront capital required. Tokenization, or fractionalizing assets, could open real estate to a broader audience.” Breaking Down the Barriers Traditional real estate investment has long been seen as the domain of high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and institutions. It’s capital-intensive, illiquid, and fragmented by jurisdiction. Enter tokenization — the process of converting ownership of physical assets into digital tokens on the blockchain, which promises to make fractional ownership, cross-border investing, and instant liquidity not only possible but increasingly mainstream. “Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize traditional asset management by offering greater efficiency, transparency, and access,” says Roger Bayston, Executive Vice President at Franklin Templeton. “It’s not just about digitizing securities. It’s about creating an entirely new financial infrastructure.” For real estate specifically, the transformation is overdue. Despite being one of the largest asset classes globally, valued at over $379.7 trillion, according to Savills, real estate remains among the least liquid. Assets can take months or even years to sell, and transaction costs are notoriously high. Tokenization reduces friction by enabling near-instant transfers on digital asset platforms, cutting out intermediaries and reducing settlement times from weeks to minutes. From Concept to Market: Binaryx Bridges the Gap Still, the real-world application of tokenized real estate has remained limited — until now. While many platforms have lingered in the experimental phase, Binaryx, a fractional real estate marketplace, is transitioning from pilot phase to broader market implementation. Founded by a team from Ukraine, the platform aims to simplify access to international real estate by lowering entry thresholds. Through asset-backed tokens, the platform offers exposure to real estate that generates passive income from rent or profit from appreciation, all without the traditional burdens of ownership. “Our goal was to break down the invisible wall between everyday investors and institutional-grade real estate,” says Oleg Kurchenko, founder and CEO of the Binaryx Platform. “By tokenizing real properties across markets like Bali, Turkey, Montenegro, and beyond, we’re opening the door to income-generating assets that were previously out of reach for millions.” Binaryx Platform’s tokenized assets are backed by a legally sound structure: each property is owned by a separate DAO LLC registered in Wyoming, USA, providing full transparency and investor protection under U.S. law. This structure enables direct, traceable ownership for token holders, not just exposure to a fund. On the Binaryx platform, you're not buying into a pooled vehicle like a REIT. Instead, you become a direct co-owner of a specific property through a DAO LLC, with your ownership rights securely recorded on-chain and legally recognized in the U.S. This structure enables a higher degree of transparency and control compared to traditional pooled real estate models such as REITs or crowdfunding platforms. A Growing Global Investor Base with Real Returns Binaryx Platform has seen continued user growth and activity since its launch. As of mid-2025, over 2,000 investors have already joined the platform, building diversified portfolios from properties across Bali, Montenegro, Turkey, and other fast-growing markets. Behind these numbers are real people seeing tangible results. Tomas, an investor from Germany, invested $10,000 in a property in Bali and began receiving monthly income almost immediately. After 11 months, his investment grew by +18.97% in capitalization, earning him $994. Another user, Kat — an IT professional from France — began with $8,200 and earned a return of +17.04% in just one year. “What impressed me most is the transparency and control,” she says. “I choose the property, I track the returns, and I can sell anytime on the secondary market.” These individual experiences reflect a broader trend: an increasing number of people are turning to tokenized real estate as a practical way to grow their wealth. Binaryx continues to attract a global investor base that values transparency, legal clarity, and control. “We’re building a borderless real estate market where trust is earned through transparency,” says CEO Oleg Kurchenko. “That’s why our retention and reinvestment rates are so strong. People invest — and then they come back.” With tangible assets, a legal framework, and recorded transactions, the platform reflects a new approach to digital property ownership. Not Without Risks — But No Longer a Thought Experiment Of course, tokenized real estate isn’t without its challenges. Legal enforceability varies by jurisdiction. Custody standards are still evolving. Secondary markets are thin, for now. But these are not fatal flaws. They’re typical growing pains of any disruptive innovation. As infrastructure, regulation, and investor understanding mature, tokenized real estate is expected to shift from niche curiosity to mainstream portfolio allocation. If the $16 trillion projection holds, tokenization won’t just be the future of real estate — it will reshape how we own, trade, and grow wealth from real-world assets. What’s Next? Looking ahead, the Binaryx platform plans to further enhance the investor experience in the coming quarter. The roadmap includes: These developments aim to make real estate investing through Binaryx even more seamless, transparent, and rewarding for everyday investors. About the Binaryx Platform Binaryx is a real estate tokenization platform that operates under Wyoming’s 2021 law (W.S. SF0038), turning real estate properties into digital tokens. For each property, Binaryx creates a dedicated LLC in Wyoming that issues tokens on the blockchain. When you buy these tokens, you become a co-owner of the LLC that owns the property, with all ownership rights protected by state law.

Title: Cardano’s Biggest Economic Event Ever Is Coming This November: Hoskinson
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-biggest-economic-event-this-november/
Time Published: 2025-06-09T13:00:03Z
Full Content:
In his latest live streamed AMA, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson declared that Midnight—the smart-contract side-chain he has long touted as the network’s privacy and compliance pillar—will ignite what he called “the single biggest economic event in the history of Cardano” and that the decisive launch sequence will culminate by November. “Cardano is going to get the largest distribution of any chain, even though it’s a smaller market-cap than Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin,” Hoskinson said, adding that Midnight’s token-generation event (TGE) and foundation rollout are “turning on this month and next month,” with a coordinated media campaign of videos, infographics and a formal tokenomics paper to follow. “If Midnight is successful, it’s the single biggest economic event in the history of Cardano,” he stressed. Hoskinson framed Midnight as the linchpin of a “triumvirate” that welds Cardano, Bitcoin and the data-protection chain into a single settlement stack. Using Taproot-enabled recursive proofs on Bitcoin for long-term finality—and an operator-based batching layer dubbed Fairgate for near-instant execution—Midnight will allow enterprises ranging from fintech giants to custodians such as BlackRock “to decide whether they want 100% Bitcoin-derived security or faster, cheaper throughput,” he said. To handle high-frequency retail flows, Input Output is folding Hydra and Lightning research into Thundercloud, a hybrid layer-two that Hoskinson believes will “shake the DeFi world” once it’s bundled with Blockfrost’s indexing and a forthcoming Hydra-Lightning amalgam proposed by developer Adam Dean. The full Fairgate–Thundercloud stack, he claimed, will be production-ready in time for the November milestone. Hoskinson’s enthusiasm for Midnight contrasted sharply with his growing frustration over Cardano’s governance gridlock. The ecosystem, he reminded viewers, now owns a 1.7 billion ADA treasury yet lacks an executive arm able to deploy it. “We could convert a hundred million dollars’ worth of ADA into USDM tomorrow,” he said, insisting that seeding liquidity across Cardano’s DeFi markets would earn yield for the treasury while solving the network’s perennial stablecoin shortage. “But people keep asking ‘save us, save us’ while stalling 39 budget votes.” That bottleneck, he argued, is the direct result of a 2022 pivot toward fully decentralized legislation and judiciary functions without restoring any counterpart executive layer. “I’m not working for $200 an hour,” he snapped, warning that Input Output (IO) will increasingly focus on “building on Cardano” rather than subsidising core infrastructure unless incentives change. The AMA also laid bare Hoskinson’s personal fatigue. “I’m tired—been on a ten-year death-march,” he confessed, revealing plans for a six-month sabbatical once Midnight is safely live and the 2026 budget overhaul begins. Nonetheless, he affirmed that IO will keep delivering imminent upgrades: Ouroboros Leios, Babel fees, Lace mobile, StarStream virtual machine integration, and node-diversity initiatives aimed at sharding mempools. Although Hoskinson teased that internal testing could push certain Midnight components live earlier than November, he framed that month as the point at which the foundation, TGE and ecosystem incentives align in public view. By then, the Midnight Foundation will have announced “over a hundred” launch partners—Brave Software being the latest named—and the capacity-token dual-model will begin routing privacy-preserving transactions back to Cardano’s Layer 1. If the rollout succeeds, Hoskinson predicts not just a surge of users and fees but a re-rating of Cardano’s strategic value in sovereign-grade finance and regulated DeFi. “Cardano plus Midnight together plus Bitcoin—we solve all those problems,” he said. Previously, Hoskinsons already revealed that the “Glacier Drop” will be a massive airdrop. It will distribute Midnight tokens (NIGHT and DUST) to approximately 37 million wallets across eight major blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Ripple, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon). At press time, ADA traded at $0.66. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Climate: Killing Clean Energy Incentives May Boost Power Prices

ByAlan Ohnsman ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. Current Climate brings you the latest news about the business of sustainability every Monday. Sign up to get it in your inbox. getty Power to the grid from solar, wind and batteries has been the fastest-growing source of new U.S. electricity generation in recent years, but proposed cuts in federal support for clean energy in the budget bill passed by House Republicans threaten to reduce the amount of renewables added by at least 10% over the next decade, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” seeks to end clean energy tax credits for all new sources except nuclear power, unless their construction starts within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and their operations begin before 2029. If passed in its current form, the loss of incentives would likely lead to a short-term rush to buy and build renewable power projects, followed by a steep dropoff late this decade, BNEF said. While 10% fewer renewable energy projects over the next decade may not seem dramatic, the impact is magnified because energy demand is expected to grow dramatically over the same period. “Imagine that your income went down 10% just as a bunch of really expensive bills were coming due. That's kind of what’s happening here,” said Derrick Flakoll, a BNEF senior policy associate. “We know there's a lot of load growth that's coming into the U.S.–more heat and hot days, more air conditioning and everybody is a little bit frantic about data centers,” he said. “We're fairly conservative in our estimates for data center growth and we still see that load doubling by 2030 and that being the biggest driver of power demand growth in the next few years.” In the case of solar, the budget bill eliminates the investment and energy production tax credits that have made it a particularly appealing option for large- and medium-scale utility power projects. Wind is likely to take the biggest hit, particularly with the loss of support for large-scale offshore wind projects. Slower growth for both owing to higher costs absent the incentives will hit individuals in the form of higher utility rates. “Even if some of these still get built, with the somewhat less favorable economics, you're also looking at them being more expensive for ratepayers,” Flakoll said. Something else that may boost electricity prices–if utilities opt to build fossil fuel or nuclear plants, a recent report from Boston University finds that those projects are more likely to be over budget and take longer than planned. Solar projects and wind farms, by contrast, are likely to be finished ahead of schedule and under budget.

AFP via Getty Images When Elon Musk appeared in the White House last week at a ceremony with President Donald Trump marking the end of his controversial role leading the federal job-slashing DOGE initiative, he sported a shiner on his right eye that he claimed came from toddler son X. That literal black eye will heal, but the figurative ones Tesla and Musk’s reputation have received from his political activities are likely to linger. Some of Tesla’s biggest shareholders — including unions like the American Federation of Teachers, whose 1.8 million members participate in pension funds with $4 trillion of assets under management, including $8.8 billion of Tesla shares — see one group as largely to blame: the EV company’s board. “People don't like Elon Musk,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told Forbes. “We've taken the position over the course of the last few months of: ‘Do your job board. Do your job financial industry. Do the job you're supposed to do, which is the governance of Tesla.’” Weingarten and the teacher’s union have been pushing fiduciary officers overseeing major state and city pension funds, as well as investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and TIAA, to review their Tesla holdings and pressure the board to change its ways. “We don't want Tesla to fail because if Tesla fails that means a lot of retirees are going to lose a lot of money in terms of their portfolios,” Weingarten said. She added: “If you're going to have Musk there, then make sure he's there. Don't have him do these extracurricular activities. Make sure he’s there or get another CEO.” Read more here ChargePoint The Trump Administration isn’t supportive of EV incentives and the budget bill eliminates them and funds for charging infrastructure. What does that mean for your business? It's a big stewpot full of headwinds and tailwinds. The current administration's position on clean energy and climate change obviously is a headwind. I think more tactically, the uncertainty around tariffs and the current budget bill and what that means for federal incentives has put a lot of uncertainty in the market, which has people on hold and waiting in some instances to decide how to move forward. Regardless of how that all comes out, I think just some certainty is going to help stabilize things and get people moving forward again. So those are headwinds. I think on the tailwind side, for us at least, we've still got a strong market in Europe without the types of headwinds we're facing here in North America. I'm firmly convinced, as biased as I am, that EVs are just a superior product to gas-powered vehicles: fewer moving parts; way more reliable; very little service required; and a better driving experience. And I think as more and more consumers experience them, the switch is going to happen, in addition to an ever-increasing selection of vehicle types for people to buy. Do higher tariffs also impact your costs for charging equipment? We have manufacturing facilities in a variety of countries, including the U.S. We've got manufacturing operations in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Romania, and the U.S. So we've got the ability to reconfigure supply chains, to mitigate tariffs, but there's definitely production of chargers overseas. And there's also the sourcing of the parts that go into chargers. Like many other hardware products, many of those come from overseas suppliers. So tariffs have an effect based on where they stand today. They're obviously very dynamic and changing regularly. We see an effect, but it's pretty minimal and we believe we can overcome it through cost reductions and other optimizations. But again, that's based on where things stand today. What does your plan to work with Eaton Corp. mean for ChargePoint’s business? Think of chargers sitting in front of the meter. If you're at home, your charger sits in front of your meter. Part of your electric bill at home, if you have a home charger, is the electricity used by your charger. Having the front-of-the-meter stuff that we develop, collaborate and cooperate with the behind-the-meter infrastructure that Eaton provides is where we can really unlock a lot of value through innovation. Making sure that the chargers in front of the meter work seamlessly and efficiently, and that they balance the energy and use the energy optimally that's being made available from the equipment behind the meter. This is really key to the innovation that we're going to develop in collaboration with Eaton and bring to market. They have various products like smart breakers and smart panels, where you now can have the charger collaborate with the rest of the home's energy use and energy management to provide solutions like [vehicle to home] power.

Title: Trump’s Truth Social Files for Bitcoin ETF

The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com President Trump has put the spotlight on spot bitcoin ETFs. Trump Media and Technology Group officially filed for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, named after Trump’s social media platform, that will directly track the price of bitcoin and trade on the NYSE Arca. It will be managed by Truth.fi, a newly created fintech platform “designed to offer investment products aligned with ‘America First’ economic priorities,” per the filing. The move is a major step toward Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency and financial services industries, opening up the potential for a major alternative to bitcoin ETFs from traditional asset managers — one that has a direct link to the Trump administration. Experts have suggested that the filing could also invite legal challenges because its ties to Trump Media could create conflicts of interest. The ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, a subsidiary of a Florida investment firm, Yorkville America, that has worked with Trump Media on “several commercial agreements,” according to the filing: The overlapping agreements are acknowledged in the filing as being potentially harmful to investors. “These existing relationships with [Trump Media] may be viewed by potential investors as affecting the sponsor’s decisions … for example by causing the sponsor to refrain from taking actions that are in the best interests of the trust but that could harm [Trump Media],” per the filing. The Future is Coin: Other cryptocurrency ETFs have also launched or made moves to launch in recent months, taking advantage of an increasingly deregulated industry. BlackRock launched iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in January, and Trump debuted his own memecoin, World Liberty Financial, in September 2024, with a focus on stablecoin. Franklin Templeton’s proposed XRP spot ETF currently awaits SEC approval and would closely follow XRP Ledger’s blockchain technology. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. More than 40 firms filed amended requests with the SEC since it nudged them to follow Dimensional’s lead, and nine filed initial applications. In the aftermath of the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day,” many investors are looking to buffer ETFs to protect against volatility. In the ever-expanding universe of ETFs, finding new products that stick is more of an art than a science, the CEO of GraniteShares says. The company, which briefly owned the biggest spot bitcoin ETF, wants to invest in another potentially disruptive technology that could even pose a… The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) took in $1.3 billion in inflows this past week. $SUI is backed by investors like Andreessen Horowitz at a valuation of $2 billion. Unlike similar mutual fund products at Vanguard, two passive tax-exempt bond ETFs don’t have a high minimum for fees of 9 basis points. A portfolio manager on at least 11 of the company’s ETFs has been with the firm since it entered the space. The two are among a laundry list of firms trying to open up private credit to Main Street investors. New artificial intelligence services may lure self-directed investors away from ETFs, and there are hazards that come with that. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Trojan Stablecoin: What Circle’s NYSE Listing Really Signals (Zurab Ashvil)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/28637/trojan-stablecoin-what-circles-nyse-listing-really-signals
Time Published: 2025-06-09T05:57:45Z
Full Content:
When Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange, most headlines celebrated the moment as a victory for crypto adoption. A stablecoin issuer, once niche and volatile by association, had now joined the ranks of America’s oldest financial institutions. But beneath the bell-ringing and ticker symbols lies a deeper story - one that challenges our assumptions about what crypto is becoming, and who will ultimately control the future of digital finance. This was not just a listing. It was a signal. Circle, the issuer of USDC, has long positioned itself as the “compliant” stablecoin: fully reserved, dollar-backed, regulated in the U.S. But its IPO marks something more profound than regulatory approval - it formalizes stablecoins as a new class of monetary infrastructure, not just a DeFi tool. By anchoring itself inside the legacy capital markets, Circle isn’t abandoning decentralization - it’s outflanking the incumbents on their own field. “You’re not seeing the crypto industry surrendering to regulation,” said Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO. “You’re seeing regulators recognizing which parts of crypto are here to stay - and why.” The NYSE, once a symbol of traditional finance, is now hosting the core operating layer of programmable money. That isn’t irony. It’s strategy. To understand the real implications of this move, we have to zoom out. The world is entering a new monetary epoch - one in which digital assets will sit alongside sovereign debt in institutional portfolios, and where transparent, composable financial instruments will become baseline infrastructure for treasuries and funds. Stablecoins are not just payment mechanisms. They are clearing rails, reserve assets, and increasingly, programmable capital. And institutions are waking up to that reality. As BlackRock, PayPal, Visa, and JP Morgan build their own digital currency infrastructure, it’s becoming clear that the future of finance won’t be built in opposition to the system - it will be built by absorbing it. Circle’s IPO was not an endpoint. It was an inflection. Like the Trojan Horse rolled into Troy, Circle entered the gates of the incumbent world not to dismantle it directly, but to transform it from the inside. By becoming a public company, Circle has won trust from banks, payment processors, regulators, and asset managers. But what it offers in return is not another fintech app. It offers programmable dollars - fiat with superpowers. “The real contest is not between crypto and fiat,” said a former BIS advisor. “It’s between programmable value and static money.” With MiCA rolling out in Europe and PayPal’s PYUSD launching in the U.S., the race is now on to establish transparent, regulator-aligned stablecoin ecosystems. Those who can embed trust, programmability, and interoperability into their stablecoins - while still playing nicely with capital markets - will shape the global liquidity layer of tomorrow. For entrepreneurs building in digital finance, this IPO should be read as a directive: Don’t just disrupt - integrate. Don’t just tokenize - institutionalize. The winners in this next cycle will not be loud anarchists or passive builders. They will be architects of the new monetary stack - those who can offer compliant, yield-generating real-world assets to treasuries, DAOs, and sovereign funds looking for stable returns in a programmable world. That’s where the real liquidity will flow. As someone building infrastructure for tokenized real estate and digital asset treasuries, I see Circle’s move not as a compromise - but as confirmation. The world is ready. The rails are forming. And trust is no longer just a legal concept. It’s a codebase. Circle didn’t just go public. They went Trojan.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Michael Saylor Downplays BTC's Quantum Threat
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/08/asia-morning-briefing-michael-saylor-downplays-btcs-quantum-threat
Time Published: 2025-06-08T23:39:28Z
Full Content:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto. So surely bitcoin BTC$108,928.32 would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. For anyone concerned about quantum computing hacking Bitcoin, please listen to @saylor calmly and rationally explain why you should sleep soundly at night. pic.twitter.com/X0XzZZl0Cd "It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token," Saylor said on CNBC. "Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system." Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ, a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. "Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year," Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is "unprepared" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. Circle (CRCL) recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data. But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X, Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported. According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an "unacceptable risk," though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported. The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions.

In a recent interview with Decrypt, Kerbrat said that blockchains could one day be used to help startup founders raise capital in a transparent way that helps them preserve control. However, under current rules in the U.S., 90% of the population wouldn’t be able to participate—because they don’t, for example, make more than $200,000 a year. Typically, as a company goes from a passion project to publicly traded firm, venture capitalists and private equity firms help raise funds along the way. When it comes to listing on a stock exchange, investment banks also play a significant role, underwriting the offering, and as Kerbrat described it, commanding a “huge banking fee.” According to Kerbrat, a founder risks losing control through share dilution, among other factors, as intermediaries extend their services on the company’s path to an eventual IPO. On top of that, venues like the Nasdaq often charge their own exchange fee, he added. “These steps are just middlemen that are taking over the company, and not necessarily creating value for your customer, for your employee base, or anything like that,” he said. “We could bring, with tokenization, a new world to raising funds, where instead of launching a new coin, you could launch a new offering for your startup and raise funds on-chain.” With a regulatory backdrop that’s more supportive of innovation, Kerbrat said that Robinhood is well positioned to help startup founders bypass middlemen, leveraging its “huge retail platform” alongside its connections on the institutional side with market makers. Instead of basing an investor’s accreditation on factors like their salary, Kerbrat argued that “the checkpoint should be education” and whether investors are aware that early-stage investments carry outsized risk. In April, Kerbrat submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission recommending that there should be knowledge-based tests and self-certification components to accreditation. “A new regulatory approach is needed to allow tokenization to flourish, and that system should be designed at a federal level to provide consistency to the marketplace,” the letter stated. Whether it’s stocks, bonds, or real estate, tokenization can refer to any asset that's represented with a token on-chain. Last month, crypto exchange Kraken said that it would begin offering users in Europe the ability to trade U.S.-listed stocks using Solana. Tokenization advocates, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have focused on benefits beyond the potential democratization of markets. When he backed tokenization in 2022, his focus was on greater market efficiency and settlement that’s nearly instantaneous. “I think there are a lot of advantages, but right now, what is blocking us from this world is a lot of [outdated] rules,” Kerbrat said, underscoring that tech isn’t what’s holding tokenization back.

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid. Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager just issued a dire warning, saying that the US will drown in debt unless the country finds a way to stimulate and grow the economy. Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Henry Holterman: Dutch Midas found a 1 billion euro gold opportunity in Greece

Full Content:
Henry Holterman is a numbers man. In this invisible but fundamental universe there is no room for misinterpretation or sentimentality. So, by the numbers, the Dutch investor is among the most successful dealmakers of the last few decades in Greece. From the recent deal to sell his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank, profitable transactions in GEK TERNA, Hellaktor and the capital gains from his holdings in Greece, both visible and hidden, are estimated to have so far earned a sum approaching €1 billion. They have been reported to have accumulated over the past few years, and in the meantime, the company has been able to report a total of more than 1 billion euros in assets to date. An impressive performance, but fully justified. Those who have met him speak of an absolutely disciplined investor, with a clear focus and a special ability to identify undervalued assets, making positions without loans and margins. In all cases of his investment moves in our country, those who have interacted with him say that he is a result-oriented person, who is not influenced by his thymic or ego, even in the tough races that have arisen. Just business, aiming for maximum profit. If others win along with it that’s fine, but it’s not an end in itself. The obstacles that appear in his path are an opportunity to rethink strategy and seek alternative moves to ensure a successful exit. No matter how long it takes. His moves reflect what he stands for in terms of investment. In early 2018 and in the midst of the shareholder civil war at Hellaktor, Holterman travelled by private plane to Athens at the invitation of the Kallitsantsis brothers who were seeking support for the proxy war that would shake the historic group, with the aim of overthrowing the then management of the construction group. The talks did not end positively, as did another venture, that of acquiring then Forthnet in partnership with the Odyssey-Athena group, but another opportunity had already arisen that brought him first a 10% and then a 30% stake in GEK Terna. He left the group of Mr George Peristeri after a long time but for an estimated €200 million. Having new firepower, he was placed in the Hellactor group and after more than two years of fierce competition, first with the Kallitsantsis side and later with the triumvirate of Kaymenakis – Bakos – Exarchos, he finally prevailed, having also secured a strong alliance with the Vardinoyannis group. This was followed by the asset sale of the once-mighty Hellactor group, which was done with mathematical sequence precision, and in 2021, when investment grade was still a distant goal for Greece, he invested in Alpha Bank. And while tons of ink had been spilled about how the Dutchman would become… a banker and increase his stake in the bank even further, he correctly interpreted the signs and decided to sell his stake, reaping a profit of more than €340 million. At the same time, he retains a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, which he acquired in the IPO for €21 million, a stake currently valued at approximately €60 million. Holterman could be said to be the epitome of the “Dutch dream”, an expression that is, of course, incongruous because, given the journalistic cliché, such stories happen all the time in America. And yet, its trajectory to date has the characteristics of a story that would easily transfer to cinema. Born in 1955, after his studies, he began working as a chartered accountant. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the largest and oldest Dutch groups active in construction and infrastructure, with Reggeborgh as its investment arm. At that time he meets and marries Herita, one of the two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. And Vessels, after all, started from the bottom. He worked in the carpentry business founded by his father, Arendt, in 1933. In 1968, at the age of 22, he took over management of the company and grew it rapidly, becoming one of the largest construction groups in Europe. In 2017, when Wessels passed away, he held third place on the list of the richest Dutchmen, with an estimated fortune of around €4 billion. Holterman took over the reins of the Vessels family business empire in 2017 after the death of his father-in-law. Reggeborgh, founded in 1990 to manage investments for the Dutch Vessel family, has now developed a portfolio of more than 20 companies in a variety of sectors, ranging from infrastructure and real estate to energy, medical research, and new technologies. The company operates in Europe and the Americas, and its portfolio includes companies such as Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorio, and EVI. In total, the family’s assets are estimated at €15-20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant investment positions, led by a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro Bank. Reggeborgh became the fifth largest shareholder in ABN Amro behind the Dutch state, US-based MFS Investment Management, Norwegian NBIM, and BlackRock. The fund had earlier sold ING its 17.6% stake in Dutch private asset manager Van Lanschot Kempen. Those who know Holterman associate his name with the description “gambler”. In Greek, the designation leaves room for many interpretations, but in the case of the Dutchman it can be said literally, as it captures his appeal for financial investments. However, one of these was destined to cause Holterman problems, which he successfully overcame and reaped significant gains, which would continue to happen in the future. Reggeborgh was among the original investors in the technology company World Online, retaining a significant stake at the time of its listing in 2000. After the IPO, however, its shares suffered a significant drop, causing losses for many investors, but not for Reggeborgh, as it was revealed that it had sold before the collapse. Holterman’s involvement with World Online also had legal ramifications, as the company’s founder, Nina Brink (aka Nina Storms) claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, claiming it was owed to her under an agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was eventually settled out of court, with the Dutchman having said there was no wrongdoing in the company’s listing and that the responsibility for the losses lay with investors’ exaggerated expectations. Under Holterman, the family office made other profitable moves, despite being under the microscope of the supervisory authorities, and in addition to World Online, the family office made significant gains from the fibre-optic companies Reggefiber and Eurofiber, as well as the investment bank NIBC. At the same time, Greece enters his life, and surely even he would not have expected that in our country, he would discover a gold mine of goodwill that added about 1 billion euros to his fortune. About 25 years ago, together with his wife, Herita, they decided to buy a holiday home in Corfu. They acquired a magnificent property in Kassiopi, an area of unique natural beauty in the north of the island where, among others, are the holiday homes of the Rothschild family, German investor Yergk Rockenhizer (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other super-rich. That’s when he met Mr. Nikos Dendia, one of the island’s best-known lawyers at the time, and long before the Corfiot lawyer, originally from Paxos, entered politics and was elected as a member of parliament. The Dendia law firm handled most of the cases of the Dutch businessman, who proved to be extremely active in investing in the country. Holterman’s ties with the Faiacs Island would prove strong in the process. He would buy a dream villa in the Kommeno area, and almost every summer, he would enjoy the beauty and refined gastronomy of Corfu. From there, he gazes at the green and blue of the bay of Gouvia, which is often crossed by the “Guilty”, the famous boat of the Ioannou family, who also maintain a holiday home in the same area. Of course, Holterman knows his way around a yacht himself, having years ago acquired the 47-metre yacht “Lars” built at the well-known Italian shipyard Sanlorenzo. However, a few years ago, he put it up for sale for 24 million euros, and it eventually changed hands for an undisclosed price. Unlike the sea, land seems to be the great love of the now 70-year-old businessman. The properties he has acquired in Corfu, as well as in Athens, are just as unique as the equity investments he has made in the country. One could say that the real estate purchases he has made reflect his investment philosophy. These were properties with excellent location and characteristics, just waiting for someone to bring out their value. A typical example is the historic “Corfu Palace” hotel, which he bought, it was reported, for €30 million from the Fokas family. The hotel started operating in 1962 and is literally in a prime location in the island town, but it has gone from periods of glory to periods of decline, as it required heavy maintenance and renovation, which was done intermittently and never completely. The “Corfu Palace” in the hands of the Dutchman is now being completely renovated, in an investment of 20 million euros, and when it reopens in 2026, it will claim a good slice of the luxury hoteling pie on the cosmopolitan island. Two years ago, it also acquired just two blocks from the “Corfu Palace,” another neoclassical building overlooking Garitsa Bay, totalling 1,000 square metres, at a price of more than 2 million euros. Five years ago, he appeared to have acquired in Corfu and the famous Red House or Antico Rosso, for 8 million euros. It is a property of stunning beauty with a 17th-century mansion built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery. It belonged to the Kourkoumeli-Rodostamos family, one of the oldest on the island, united by the marriage of Nikolaos Rodostamos and Maria, sister of Ioannis Kapodistrias. Those who know him say that from the first moment, he loved Corfu, and he constantly makes sure to prove it. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, the Coast Guard, the Police, supports the Center for the Disabled “Melissa” and the Corfu ambulance, but also non-profit organizations, sports clubs, and federations through Hellaktor. In 2022, he, his wife, and their son were honorary naturalized Greek citizens. The properties he has acquired in Corfu are not the only ones, as he has also made several purchases in Athens. In the capital, real estate insiders say Holterman has built up a substantial property portfolio, part of which was acquired by REDS, which paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., a company managed by the Holterman family. Hestia Luxury Apartments, a subsidiary of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. It also owns other properties, in addition to those in Corfu and those owned by Hellaktor. Real estate, moreover, is one of his favorite investments. In the Netherlands, the couple Henry and Herita reside in an understated luxury residence in Holden, a picturesque town known for its natural beauty and the Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park. When it was acquired, it was worth under 1 million, while today it is priced several times that. His penchant for investing in real estate leads many to conclude that his next step after his successful deals in Greece with GEK Terna, Hellactor, and Alpha Bank will be real estate, specifically the creation of a property management company. Hellactor, following the sale of its assets (most recently Aktor Concessions), now has, through REDS, its most important asset, Alimos Marina, although there have been reports that its sale has been discussed, which remains to be seen if it is true. REDS, on the other hand, has agreed to sell to Dimand two of its very important projects, the project at Gournes in Heraklion, Crete, and the Cambas Project at Kantza, Pallini. The company still has several assets in Greece and abroad, with REDS getting into hotels as well, as together with SWOT they have entered into a 25-year lease of the hotel property on Kifissia Avenue (formerly “Civitel”), owned by the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which they are renovating, while they are also expected to collaborate on “Corfu Palace”. What is certain is that a few days ago, REDS Hospitality was established by the parent company REDS, owned by Hellaktor, in order to operate in the wider hospitality sector. In addition to the Hestia Luxury Apartments properties and hotels, other moves are being prepared, and it is no coincidence that REDS is participating in the ETAD’s tender for the long-term lease of Vouliagmeni Beach in a joint venture with the Melissanidis family’s Aegean Warehouses. These are the facts, with real estate coming to the fore. Beyond that, Reggeborgh, after selling its stake in Alpha Bank, said it will continue to invest in Greece. However, this is not 2018, when valuations were still low, the economy has taken the investment grade, and the stock market has hit 15-year highs again. What will be Holterman’s next move as a player? Explore related questions

Retail Bob Etchingham Businessman Bob Etchingham, who founded Irish forecourt giant Applegreen, has resigned as a director of artisan food chain The Butler’s Pantry. The resignation has followed reports last year that the business had been sold. Both Bob and Sarah Etchingham resigned as directors from The Butler’s Pantry Holdings last week, a business the Applegreen chairman’s Belgrave Capital had owned. The pair remain as directors of The Butler’s Pantry (Manufacturing) Ltd. In December, accounts released by The Butler’s Pantry Holdings said the company was due to change hands at the end of 2024. Reports linked Natural Bakery owner Luke Creighan with the acquisition, but this was never confirmed. He is now the sole director of The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. “The new owners expect to derive synergies by incorporating The Butler’s Pantry Holdings Limited into their existing business and thereby improve the trading performance of the company,” the accounts read. The accounts said a share purchase agreement for the business was made with a third party on May 10, 2024. Creighan was appointed as a director later that same month. Creighan has built up a reputation in the franchising space, owning some Eurospar stores and Insomnia and Four Star Pizza franchises. He founded The Natural Bakery in 2013 and has since expanded it to 10 locations. The Sunday Independent attempted to email Creighan and a separate employee of The Natural Bakery to ask if he had bought The Butler’s Pantry but did not receive a response. Etchingham declined to comment. Etchingham first joined The Butler’s Pantry as a director in March 2016, building up a stake in the business through a separate investment company, Appletreewick Nominees. In 2019, Appletreewick increased its stake to 75pc in The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. It put €3.6m into the company around the same time as last May’s share purchase agreement. Etchingham made his millions with Applegreen, which was taken private by Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in a deal worth €718.1m back in December 2020. The Butler’s Pantry was set up in 1987 by Eileen Bergin and opened its first outlet on Mount Merrion Avenue in Blackrock. Jacquie Marsh subsequently took it over. The Butler’s Pantry 2023 accounts show a loss of €1.15m. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Posted on 06/07/2025 10:37:13 AM PDT by george76 Leaving the port of Darwin in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. Hooroo, China! Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is evidently making good on an election campaign pledge to reclaim the Port of Darwin, a harbor in Australia’s Northern Territory, from Chinese control. The Chinese firm Landbridge has operated the port since 2015 under a 99-year lease. Last week the American private-equity firm Cerberus voiced interest in leasing the port from Canberra. Albanese cited national security grounds for breaking the lease. Why Darwin Matters.. Why does Chinese control over Darwin’s port matter? First and foremost, Darwin occupies prime real estate. Maritime historian Alfred Thayer Mahan fashioned a trio of metrics to help naval officialdom judge the worth of any strategic position, chiefly candidate sites for naval bases. “Situation,” or geographic position, meant a site’s proximity to something naval commanders wanted to influence—a hostile base, an important seacoast, or a strategic waterway. “Strength” connoted some combination of natural and manmade defenses to hold enemies at bay. “Resources” referred to the port’s or surrounding countryside’s ability to furnish warships with fuel, ammunition, and stores of all types. Darwin measures up handily by Mahanian standards in all three metrics—strategic position in particular. It is Australia’s northernmost major harbor, situated along an outcropping of land jutting toward the rim of the South China Sea. Maritime forces stationed there enjoy a central position just outside the southerly arc of Asia’s first island chain, which meanders from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and the Indonesian archipelago before terminating at the Strait of Malacca. Of particular note, the Sunda and Lombok straits, the best alternative passages to Malacca, lie within reach of Darwin. Darwin Port’s fortunate position affords ships and aircraft liberty of horizontal movement. They can range from side to side on the map, helping seal off the first island chain to Chinese maritime and air movement. They also enjoy vertical access to the South China Sea, one of Asia’s and the world’s most embattled expanses. Small wonder, then, that some 2,500 US Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force now rotate through the port on an annual basis. Among other functions, these Marines are honing tactics for access denial while helping beleaguered allies like the Philippines uphold their nautical rights in the face of Chinese gray-zone aggression. On occasion, Darwin has also played host to US Navy attack submarines. Just this March, for instance, the attack boat USS Minnesota, accompanied by submarine tender Emory S. Land, put into the harbor for a port call. In short, Darwin occupies a strategic position of great price while boasting resources adequate to support seagoing forces. Leaving the port in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. At a bare minimum, Chinese observers could gather intelligence on Australian Defense Force and allied comings and goings while abetting net assessment of allied capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In so doing, they help acquaint the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with potential foes, the first step toward defeating them. Nor is it farfetched to imagine Chinese port operators slow-rolling—or, more likely, actively hampering—allied military movements and resupply in wartime. Bear in mind that there is no such thing as an apolitical agreement with a Chinese company. Politics permeates everything in China; politics is warfare without bloodshed for the Chinese Communist Party; and domestic law obliges all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to comply with party mandates on matters relating to national security. In other words, businesses constitute a geopolitical cudgel for Beijing as surely as the PLA does. And the party wields that weapon with zest on a 24/7/365 basis. So, kudos to Prime Minister Albanese for reasserting friendly dominion over Darwin Port. America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility. Geopolitics maven Nicholas Spykman observed that digging the Panama Canal in effect rewrote Western Hemisphere maritime geography. In practical terms, by sparing merchantmen and ships of war the long voyage around South America, artificially modifying geography teleported American east-coast ports thousands of miles closer to East Asia. Traders could now compete with European rivals on a more equal footing because merchant ships’ journeys to Pacific trading partners were comparable in length and duration. Just as important, the US Navy could swing forces from side to side through the Caribbean Sea, concentrating and reconcentrating fleets in whichever ocean the leadership deemed most in need. If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports. A country that cedes control of its ports to China grants Beijing the option to snap its sea-power chain. Deliberately empowering an antagonist in this way courts ruin. Don’t let China break the chain.

The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America.

They can range from side to side on the map, helping seal off the first island chain to Chinese maritime and air movement. They also enjoy vertical access to the South China Sea, one of Asia’s and the world’s most embattled expanses. Small wonder, then, that some 2,500 US Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force now rotate through the port on an annual basis. Among other functions, these Marines are honing tactics for access denial while helping beleaguered allies like the Philippines uphold their nautical rights in the face of Chinese gray-zone aggression. On occasion, Darwin has also played host to US Navy attack submarines. Just this March, for instance, the attack boat USS Minnesota, accompanied by submarine tender Emory S. Land, put into the harbor for a port call. In short, Darwin occupies a strategic position of great price while boasting resources adequate to support seagoing forces. Leaving the port in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. At a bare minimum, Chinese observers could gather intelligence on Australian Defense Force and allied comings and goings while abetting net assessment of allied capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In so doing, they help acquaint the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with potential foes, the first step toward defeating them. Nor is it farfetched to imagine Chinese port operators slow-rolling—or, more likely, actively hampering—allied military movements and resupply in wartime. Bear in mind that there is no such thing as an apolitical agreement with a Chinese company. Politics permeates everything in China; politics is warfare without bloodshed for the Chinese Communist Party; and domestic law obliges all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to comply with party mandates on matters relating to national security. In other words, businesses constitute a geopolitical cudgel for Beijing as surely as the PLA does. And the party wields that weapon with zest on a 24/7/365 basis.

If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports. A country that cedes control of its ports to China grants Beijing the option to snap its sea-power chain. Deliberately empowering an antagonist in this way courts ruin.

If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America.

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine.

They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

The Hate Industry is still alive in the US and across the West. The politics of Hate has divided individuals, countries and the world - you can almost trace it’s ugly emergance on the world scene with Obama’s presidency as it errupted in the States. I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere. I had gone from working with all races oversea to returning to a country where race defined benefits, schooling and even if you could be a racist - how the American people were lulled into this is anyone’s guess. But the fear of the elites across the west is evident. 16 posted on 06/07/2025 11:58:40 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: DIRTYSECRET They killed Sadat.

The reason that Russian and USA and NATO strategic bombers are parked in plain sight is so Russian and USA spy satellites can keep track of the exact number that exist. This tracking system is part of nuclear weapon agreements signed by Russia, USA, and NATO. The bombers Ukraine destroyed are part of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It is likely that NONE of the destroyed Russian planes ever dropped a conventional bomb on Ukraine.

I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back.

Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Title: Bitcoin vs. macro pressure – Is $100K still safe amid rate-cut bets, inflation risks?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-vs-macro-pressure-is-100k-still-safe-amid-rate-cut-bets-and-inflation-risks/
Time Published: 2025-06-07T17:00:42Z
Full Content:
June’s volatility may shake out weak hands in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s [BTC] resilience has been on full display lately. Despite a barrage of macro noise, rate cut odds, Trump’s Fed shakeup tease, and institutional reshuffling, BTC is still trading above $100,000 on the charts. And in doing so, it has kept FOMO on a low simmer without flipping into euphoria. Such a setup screams bullish continuation. You see, we’re halfway through 2025, and the market’s leaning hard into the rate-cut narrative – 97.4% odds for a cut at the next FOMC. That’s a big vote of confidence. However, here’s the thing – What if the Fed doesn’t budge? What if the CPI ticks higher and inflation throws a wrench in the plan? Mid-June could get messy. On the contrary, if BTC retains its strength, it could set the tone for a breakout heading into the second half of the year. May’s Non-Farm Payrolls report came in solid. 139,000 jobs added vs. 125,000 expected, though slightly below April’s 147,000. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, highlighting a steady but healthy labor market. Source: Trading Economics Skeptics might argue that this strong employment data contradicts the idea of a rate-cut pivot. After all, why lower borrowing costs when economic activity is stable? David Hernandez, Crypto Investment Specialist at 21Shares, told AMBCrypto, “BTC has found solid footing above the meaningful $100,000 support level, with each day spent above this level strengthening it as a foundation for future upward moves.” He added that Bitcoin’s ability to hold through volatility reflects growing institutional conviction. Especially with the Fed funds market pricing in near-100% odds of a pause this June. Simply put, stable labor data means inflation pressures are manageable without more tightening. This gives the Fed room to pause rate hikes. In turn, it also encourages investment flows into risk-on assets like Bitcoin. As the U.S. economy continues to tame inflationary pressures with a string of “better-than-expected” data, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Fed holds rates steady at the upcoming meeting. However, what about those 97.4% odds priced in? Well, that’s why Bitcoin’s resilience matters. While short-term volatility is inevitable as investors reposition ahead of the Fed’s decision, BTC’s ability to hold the $100k-level keeps FOMO intact. It also validates its structural support. In fact, we’ve seen this dynamic play out repeatedly over the past two weeks. Despite BlackRock reducing its exposure, Bitcoin hasn’t flinched. Holding six figures in the face of institutional distribution underscores just how solid BTC’s macro setup really is. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In an unexpected twist, Trump teased a new Fed Chair pick recently, despite Powell’s term running until 2026. Source: The Kobeissi Letter His comments added fuel to the speculative fire and helped push crypto markets up 2.5% over 24 hours – Alongside $35 million in short liquidations. But if this is just hype—and not substance—there’s a risk this relief rally fades just as fast. If CPI stays contained and the Fed delivers the expected pause, this base at $100k will become launchpad territory. On the other hand, if the market’s pricing proves premature, we could see a volatility shakeout before the next leg. Right now, Bitcoin isn’t breaking down – It’s loading up. And, if the macro deck falls into place, the next breakout may not just reclaim highs, but rewrite them.

Editor Tech CoinDesk, Francisco Rodrigues The messaging app, with over 1 billion users, plans to use $955 million to buy back existing bonds and the remaining $745 million for growth. Telegram has secured $1.7 billion by issuing five-year convertible bonds, aiming to refinance existing liabilities and push out repayment deadlines. The messaging app, which now counts over 1 billion users, will use $955 million of the new funds to buy back bonds maturing in 2026, Bloomberg reports. The remaining $745 million gives the company fresh capital to bolster its operations or invest in growth. Investors in the new bonds will have a shot at converting their holdings into equity if Telegram goes public before the notes mature. In that scenario, they would be entitled to redeem at 80% of the initial public offering price. The tender offer closed May 28, with settlement expected on June 5. CoinDesk previously reported the round drew interest from from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel The notes carry a 9% coupon, two percentage points above Telegram’s previous $2.35 billion bond issued in 2021. Telegram passed $1 billion in revenue last year and holds over $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto, Bloomberg’s report adds.

아빠찬스 Here are five key takeaways from the US jobs report for May https://t.co/URzOFQM4zF ICYMI: A hiring freeze that impedes the Bureau of Labor Statistics may cost Americans a lot more than the government saves.Read @JonathanJLevin ⬇️https://t.co/RVpvbz2BhX 트럼프 노동부에서 발표한 5월 비농업 '고용 보고서'('NFP')에 따르면 '일자리' 증가율은 이전 두 달에 비해 총 95,000명 감소한 후 139,000명 증가하면서 '둔화'되었고 전월은 하향 조정되었지만 실업률은 4.2%로 변동없이 안정적으로 '유지'되었습니다. NFP 보고서는 고소득 노동자의 임금이 포함되는 등 시장금리 대장지표라 불립니다. Lori Chavez-DeRemer '노동부 장관'은 일자리 보고서에 관해 "지난 몇 달 동안 우리가 본 것은 미국 태생의 미국인들이 일자리 증가가 일어나고 있다는 것입니다. 우리는 먼저 미국 노동자를 보호하고 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다."라고 말하였습니다.

The shares of the stablecoin giant Circle surged on its first day as a public company. In a post on the social media platform X, the issuer of the second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC and the euro-pegged Euro Coin (EURC) says its shares can now be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company initially announced plans to go public back in 2021. “Circle is now officially a public company, listed on the NYSE under CRCL. With USDC, EURC, Circle Payments Network & more, we’re pushing forward a future of frictionless value exchange. We are not just building financial products. We are building the money layer of the internet.” Circle made its stock market debut on Thursday with an opening price of $69 per share, up by 168.48% from the initial public offering (IPO) price of $31.00 per share. The company originally aimed for an IPO price of about $28 per share, but pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse says this is relatively low. “ I think $28 is going to look cheap over a multi-month period. Outside of the initial event volume, I will be looking for price to develop a clean range and ideally start to establish a longer-term position.” Circle’s stock peaked at $103.75 and closed at $83.23 on Thursday. Financial titan BlackRock reportedly plans to accumulate 10% of Circle’s shares. The world’s largest asset manager is already the acting reserve manager for the assets backing USDC.

Title: Circle’s victory: How USDC is rewriting the stablecoin playbook

Full Content:
Could USDC finally crack Tether’s fortress and rewrite the stablecoin playbook? The stablecoin market is heating up again. But this time, it’s not just another routine “flight-to-safety” shuffle. By launching its IPO on the NYSE, Circle plugged traditional finance straight into stablecoins, and the market didn’t hold back. USDC shot up 170%, closing at $84 from a $31 IPO price, pushing Circle’s valuation to $18 million. The timing is razor-sharp. With crypto volatility through the roof, stablecoins are the ultimate safe harbor. Sure, Tether [USDT] still wears the crown, but is Circle’s bold move sparking a liquidity shakeup? Circle’s IPO had an explosive first day, jumping from $31 to close at $82, a 171% gain and even hitting $93 intraday. The offering was 25 times over-subscribed, boosting Circle’s market value from $6.9 billion at open to around $17–20 billion. Source: Yahoo Finance But USDC still trails Tether in the stablecoin race. The reason? USDC currently has $60.3 billion in supply, roughly two-thirds the size of Tether. But Tether still dominates with $1 trillion in monthly volume making it significantly more profitable. Now, imagine if that flips. What if Tether’s hefty $153 billion supply suddenly struggles to attract liquidity as capital starts flowing elsewhere? That’s exactly the game Circle’s IPO is playing. According to AMBCrypto, it is aiming to rewrite the stablecoin rulebook. Circle’s NYSE debut wasn’t just about market cap. Instead, it pulled in some serious heavy hitters. Notably, big names like BlackRock and ARK jumped in, loading up on Circle shares and showing some serious confidence. Why does this matter? If buyers start stepping up, that $60.3 billion USDC supply could become a real advantage. Plus, Circle’s IPO is doing more than just raising cash, it’s helping stablecoins break into the traditional finance world for real. Source: TradingView (USDC.D) Meanwhile, Tether’s sitting on a mountain of supply that might just become a liability. So on the utility front, USDC is making moves, stepping up its game and challenging USDT’s long-held dominance. This is a strategic masterstroke led by Circle. If it takes off, the stablecoin market could face a major paradigm shift — one where USDC becomes the go-to liquidity magnet.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, fuelled by a combination of U.S. president Donald Trump’s support and Wall Street adoption (with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk making a dramatic return to the front lines of crypto this week). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, after rebounding sharply from its April lows, has held above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May even after BlackRock issued a serious bitcoin warning. Now, as fears swirl of a “cataclysmic” U.S. dollar collapse, Jim Esposito, the president of market maker Citadel Securities, has warned the spiraling $37 trillion U.S. debt pile is a “ticking time bomb”—adding to similar warnings that some think could be about to send the bitcoin price sharply higher.

More Wall Street's embrace of crypto pushes up the bitcoin price. “The stock of debt and the budget deficit is a ticking time bomb,” Esposito said at the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & Trading Conference in comments reported by Reuters. “No one is smart enough to predict when exactly it will rear its ugly head. We’ve been talking about this for more than 20 years, so in some ways the market’s gone into complacency, but over a multi-year period we can work this out.” Esposito added that Citadel Securities, a Wall Street market-making giant that was founded by hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, plans to ramp up its bitcoin and crypto trading this year in anticipation of a new crypto regulatory framework. "Crypto is definitely a space we’re going to get bigger in, and we're excited about the prospects," Esposito added. The worsening U.S. debt crisis, which has dramatically blown up the relationship between Elon Musk and president Trump this week, was exacerbated by massive government spending through Covid lockdowns. The rise in U.S. debt comes as the Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, holds the line on interest rates despite pressure from Trump and the bond market suffers highly volatile swings that are a sign of waning faith in the U.S. from investors. Economic and monetary uncertainty has pushed some traders and companies toward bitcoin, leading to a flood of bullish bitcoin price predictions.

More spiraling U.S. debt pile. “The dominant story for bitcoin has changed again,” Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick wrote in an emailed note. “It was correlation to risk assets ... It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of U.S. assets.” Kendrick has predicted the bitcoin price will soar to $500,000 per bitcoin by the end of Trump’s presidency in early 2029 as a result of his U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve and the ending of stifling regulations that will see more companies buy bitcoin. “Institutions are reinforcing their exposure to bitcoin, building out their bitcoin treasuries,” Seamus Rocca, the chief executive of bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments. "Whether you’re looking at institutional flows or retail behavior, the message is the same: conviction in bitcoin’s long-term value is holding firm–and growing.”

Title: Organizing an Electoral Revolution. Forging a Path to Freedom

Any society needs a monetary system to advance beyond the most primitive level. The trouble arises when the system is taken over by the most selfish and ruthless elements who use it for their own self-aggrandizement to the detriment of everyone else in the community. This is what has happened in the nations of the Collective West. The primary mechanism of control is creation of a banking system based on usury—i.e., charging interest on loans. This fee for the privilege of taking part in the economic life of society is in fact an indirect tax that goes to support a financial aristocracy that ends up controlling all trade, politics, and even culture. A façade of “democracy” and “self-government” may be maintained for appearances’ sake, but this is really a mechanism to engender the “war of each against all” so people won’t notice they are being controlled and manipulated. In today’s world, a revolt against this system is gathering steam, led by “civilizational states” like Russia, China, Iran, India, and others—all states the Collective West defines as “threats.” The financial elites quickly move to destroy any movement toward monetary reform, even as they tolerate or even encourage other types of relatively harmless protest, including “elections,” as well as self-destructive activities like drugs, sexual degeneracy, etc. The last US protest against the financial system was the “Occupy Wall Street” movement that was quickly suppressed. Nevertheless, the core of a monetary reform movement has remained and continues to attract notice. Among these has been the “End the Fed” campaign of people like Ron Paul and Thomas Massey, but also a much more sophisticated group that has its roots in the activities of the American Monetary Institute, the Public Banking Institute, the Direct Funding movement, etc. A notable component of this effort was the NEED Act of 2011 entered onto the ledger of Congress by Dennis Kucinich, adopted as part of the platform of the Green Party, and still on the books. Today, we present a major proposal for direct action by one of the leaders of the Green Party, Howard Switzer from his Substack, “Howard’s Newsletter.” Howard is an architect promoting earth-friendly construction and sovereign monetary reform. He is a founding member and former co-chair of the Green Party of Tennessee and served many terms on the Green Party’s National Committee as a delegate from Tennessee while running for office in Tennessee three times. In 2017 he led a successful defense of the “Greening the Dollar” plank in the Green Party Platform against an effort by outside advocates of “Modern Monetary Theory” to remove it. He is also a founding board member and former president of the Alliance for Just Money, and he is a co-founder and a current co-chair of the GPUS Banking and Monetary Reform Committee (BMRC). —Richard C. Cook, June 5, 2025 *** By Howard Switzer, June 3, 2025 I have been reading numerous essays exposing and describing the enormous, catastrophic, horrific and unbelievably profitable crimes of the System, the capitalist monetary system. It is the mechanism of power in the private hands of the Monsters of Mammon, the apparent psychopaths who control the allocation of global capital, the money, thus “everything,” as Henry Kissinger famously noted. Most of those essays do not have a hint of what to do about it. The cynical use of the axioms “if it bleeds it leads” or “If it burns it earns” by the Monster’s mass media are used because they know that humans have a negativity bias that attracts our attention while positive stories do not. Those stories then get highlighted and repeated by numerous essay writers whose attention was captured. This constant assault impacts our mental and physical health. Research has shown that people can exhibit increased depression and anxiety symptoms after only 14 minutes of news consumption. Negative headlines seriously play on our emotions too, which is why they push engagement so powerfully. “A recent Stanford University study reported, for example, that emotional stories are around 22 times more memorable than facts alone.”[1] This increased stress is a major factor in illnesses. To protect our health, we are told to reduce our exposure. Negativity bias is related to our fight-or-flight response but the ‘recommendation for protecting our health’ seems to be flight rather than fight. Considering our predicament flight does not seem to be a viable option, for where can we go to escape this gargantuan monster’s global grip? Further, this serves the Monster’s agenda by keeping the people distracted by the symptoms of the disease, so they don’t see the disease itself. Those who write about solutions are ignored in favor of those who write only about the seemingly intractable problems. The constant exposure to pain and fear makes us susceptible to neuroticism. “Compellingly, out-group animosity (denigrating one’s political opponents online) appears to be a stronger motivation to vote than in-group amity (friendliness). Thus, there appears to be political capital in encouraging online hate by one’s supporters. A 2018 study, for example, studied two populist rhetoric driven campaigns: Donald Trump’s 2016 US presidential campaign and the UK Brexit referendum from the same year. Researchers reported that both campaigns heavily appealed to similar pain points—fear, for example, as well as lost national pride, overplayed immigration fears, baiting opposing voter groups, and racism, or the fear of other nationalities or ethnicities. These negative headlines powerfully drove exposure and engagement.”[1] All this indicates that to attract attention to fighting this we need to generate animosity for the Monsters of Mammon. However directing it at humans, no matter how awful they are, seems counter to the world’s need for greater empathy and care to reduce dangerous and destructive fear, replacing it with love, the other root emotion. Thus, I think we need to focus our hatred and animosity on the System, the capitalist monetary system, which is the illegitimate mechanism of power, a usurpation of power with the sin of usury. A power that rightfully belongs to us all, not a greedy, and one can only assume a psychologically damaged, few. Usury does have serious psychological consequences. It seems like we need to understand how the System operates then organize and express our hatred for what it does. The issues facing civil society seem to get bigger and more urgent with every election cycle and polls show that the number one issue for most of the electorate, regardless of political affiliation, regardless of which party is in power, is the economy. What about the economy that makes it an issue? The answer unequivocally is money. People don’t have enough money to pay for the things they and their family need to maintain a decent quality of life; food, shelter, transportation, healthcare and enough money to pay their debts so as not to default on their loans and lose what they have. People are not concerned about inflation if they have enough money. No solution to the problem of poverty has ever been so effective as providing income to the poor, income is by far the best antidote for deprivation. An economy in depression is an economy with not enough money in circulation, a policy of austerity only makes it worse. The truth is that nothing denies a person liberty more than the absence of money and no truth has ever spawned more ingenious evasion than that. If the lack of money is the problem, then a political party that wants to win must offer a viable solution to that problem. Why is it that 80% of the population is struggling for lack of money? Over 60% could not cover a $400 emergency. People can see that the economy is not designed to serve most people. “The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer” is an aphorism that has been popularly repeated since long before the civil war. We have an economic system that steadily transfers wealth to the super-rich. People have felt powerless as their government bails out the big banks and spends trillions on corporate subsidies and foreign wars. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this process as 8 million more Americans slid into poverty, 100 million world-around, and100,000 small businesses, responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in the U.S. economy, closed their doors permanently. At the same time the world’s billionaires increased their wealth to a record $10.2 trillion, and that is just the amount they admit to. This is where we are, what some call “late-stage capitalism” is an unleashed neoliberal crime fest as private equity firms pillage any company that has value now even targeting retirement savings and healthcare. They are coming for our homes too. The result is increased economic suffering, homelessness, and increasing oppression to keep it going that way. Our elections and public policy are controlled by money. All the regulatory agencies are captured by the industries they are supposed to regulate, and the military industrial complex takes the lion’s share of discretionary spending year after year as interest payments on the federal debt blow past a trillion dollars per year. These are the reasons that trust in the two major political parties and our national institutions has fallen to a record low. There have been calls for a new political party to pick up the pieces and champion the American people. A party that can effectively tie economic justice to monetary reform can galvanize 80% of the population, farmers, working-class and small business Americans, to challenge elite power and present a credible alternative to establishment politics. The Green Party has the platform and infrastructure to be that party. What it lacks is vision. Can there be any doubt that money rules the roost? That being the case it behooves us to look at the money system we have since it is not taught in any of our schools and has long been kept shrouded in mystery. It is our nation’s privatized monetary system that creates and allocates the money. There have been numerous calls for monetary reform over the last 240 years, but most people are unaware of them as the systemic solution has always been drowned out by constant debates over polarizing issues. The System is a system of usury; the abuse of monetary authority for personal gain which has been described as an extraordinarily efficient form of violence by which one can do the most damage with the least amount of effort. We call this System capitalism. Capitalism = (capital = money) + (ism = system) = money system. The central feature and source of the awesome power of the Monsters of Mammon is the debt-based private global monetary system they own and operate through the global banking system. Capitalism is often wrongly conflated with “free enterprise” and “free markets” but capitalism ensures that these are NOT free. This is because capitalism is a debt parasite on the back of free enterprise making every household, business and government in this world in debt and dependent on the banking System. The System issues all money as interest-bearing debt in the process of making loans. That may sound relatively benign because it has been normalized, but it is a form of slavery that systematically concentrates wealth to the wealthiest, the Monsters of Mammon. Credit, used for money, is created by the banking system as the principal of a loan and, because that is the way money is created, the interest on that loan must be paid from money created by another’s loan. This drives destructive growth and predatory competition as people compete to pay the interest on their debts, so they won’t default on their loan and lose their real wealth collateral. The System is not stable because when loan payments (money destroyed) exceed loans being made (money created) the System crashes for lack of money creating a recession or depression depending on the amounts and how many loans default. This causes a massive transfer of wealth because when this happens the real-wealth collateral is picked up for pennies on the dollar by those with the money. Furthermore, interest is compounded (interest on interest) throughout the System’s economy which is built into the prices of all the goods and services we buy, on average 50%. This means money going to the Monsters of Mammon with every transaction. “All wars are bankers wars” To be clear by bankers I mean their shareholders, the Monsters of Mannon, who demand a constant flow of profits. The System has for over 500 years, forced sovereign governments to turn over their sovereignty, their monetary authority, to the bankers due to war debt. The word capitalism comes from the French word, “capitalisme,” which refers to the system of war finance, or the practice of borrowing large amounts of money to fund the costs of war. War debt is how the Monsters of Mammon got nations to hand over their monetary authority to the wealthy private interests. who controlled large accumulations of money. You can tell those who are resistant by looking at the System’s list of enemies, the smaller of which have been or are being destroyed by war. The larger enemies are continually being threatened with war. The System allows control of every industry in the world by the Monsters of Mannon. It dominates the ownership of raw materials, the means of production, exploits earth’s materials and labor, concentrates wealth, creates poverty, drives destructive growth, predatory competition and all wars. The System has made the U.S. Dollar the international reserve currency and abuses its currency dominance using sanctions and war to gain control over resources it wants to exploit. The System is a system of debt slavery: student loans, medical debt, and credit card exploitation trap millions. The System causes inflation. Issuing money as debt is itself inflationary, but banks can increase inflation at will which is used as a weapon for controlling economies or bring them to their knees. Every instance of hyperinflation you’ve heard of was caused by banks making war upon a nation’s economy. The governments blamed for hyperinflation were the targets and have long served as the whipping boy for the crimes of the Monsters of Mammon. The System allows the massive accumulation of money making it an instrument of power with which to control, industry, governments, economies, in short, as Henry Kissinger said, “…if you control the money, you can control everything.” The banking oligopoly, a handful of megabanks like JPMorgan, CITI Bank, Bank of America, etc., control most of the lending and are all owned, along with all the major corporations and their subsidiaries, by the largest asset managers in the world, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, behind which the Monsters of Mammon hide and shield themselves from liability and accountability. The System uses technology as a weapon but sells to us as a convenience, thus they profit from selling the very tools they use as a weapon to subjugate us and the world. Digital surveillance, private fintech, cryptocurrency and AI all threaten financial freedom and are employed by the Monsters of Mammon to make war upon the world. This list could go on getting into more detail but that should be enough to make you realize the scale of what we are up against. To fight it we must summon forth the courage that David did to fight Goliath. Like David’s slingshot our weapon may seem too small and impotent for the job and yet it got the job done with miraculous efficiency. Our weapon is Monetary Reform, a term that people may find mundane and are unfamiliar with because it is not taught in schools; the System does not allow the monetary system to be a legitimate field of inquiry. Economists, to protect their careers, shun knowledge of it. Economics studies wealth while ignoring power and Political Science studies power while ignoring wealth. This is what makes these fields so mind-numbingly boring. However, Political Economy, the study of the relationship between wealth and power, makes both relevant and exciting.

Title: FCA clears path for UK retail crypto ETF trading—kind of

FCA aims to strike balance between market growth and consumer protection with crypto ETN access. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has proposed lifting its longstanding ban on crypto exchange-traded notes for retail investors, opening the door for broader access to regulated crypto exposure through public investment exchanges. The move, announced June 6, forms part of a broader regulatory push to bolster market competitiveness and reduce barriers for financial firms. Retail investors would be allowed to purchase crypto ETNs, debt instruments tied to digital asset prices, if these are listed on a recognized investment exchange and meet the UK’s financial promotion rules. The FCA emphasized that safeguards would still apply, including requirements for risk disclosures and restrictions on promotional incentives, similar to the rules for direct digital asset sales. The FCA’s proposal does not extend to spot crypto ETFs like in the US through BlackRock and the Newborn Nine. ETNs (Exchange-Traded Notes) are unsecured debt securities that track the price of a digital asset but do not hold the underlying asset. The FCA proposes allowing retail access to these as long as they’re listed on recognized investment exchanges and meet financial promotion rules. Spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), which directly hold crypto (e.g., Bitcoin) as the underlying asset, are not currently permitted in the UK and remain subject to broader regulatory and legislative constraints. The FCA has not proposed changes here. So, this consultation does not pave the way for spot ETFs in the UK. Any move in that direction would likely require new rules around custody, fund structures, and potentially legislative change. For now, ETNs are the FCA’s chosen compromise vehicle for retail exposure under tight oversight. Charlie Morris from crypto ETF issuer ByteTree celebrated the news, stating, “I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.” [Editor’s Note: In Europe, many issuers (ByteTree included) market their physically-backed crypto products as “ETFs”, even though the legal wrapper is an ETP/ETN/ETC. ByteTree’s blog explicitly lumps the terms together, describing “Bitcoin ETFs (also referred to as ETPs, ETNs, ETCs)” when discussing London listings. Their tweet is therefore branding rather than a statement of new ETF permissions.] What will change if the proposal is adopted? Retail clients could buy the same sterling-denominated crypto ETNs that professional investors already trade on the London Stock Exchange, such as 21Shares, WisdomTree, or Invesco products (including ByteTree’s BOLD bitcoin-and-gold ETN). The trading experience will look like an ETF, with a ticker on an exchange and intraday liquidity. Still, the instrument will remain a note, with counterparty risk to the issuer and no direct title to the underlying coins. The consultation reverses the FCA’s 2021 policy of barring retail access to crypto ETNs and derivatives. While the retail ban on crypto derivatives will remain in force, the regulator’s latest stance reflects its evolving posture on high-risk investments and its intention to grant consumers greater autonomy in choosing investment products. According to FCA executive director David Geale, the shift represents an effort to “rebalance” the regulator’s risk framework, allowing retail participants to decide whether such investments align with their risk tolerance. The change follows a March 2024 update in which the FCA said it would not object to UK exchanges launching dedicated market segments for crypto ETNs aimed at professional investors. The new proposal would extend this access to retail customers, provided the products are listed on an FCA-recognized venue, such as the London Stock Exchange, and comply with investor protection mandates. The announcement appears alongside the FCA’s broader quarterly consultation, which includes measures to simplify reporting obligations for asset managers and reduce unnecessary data collection across regulated firms. While those measures aim to ease compliance burdens for traditional financial services, the crypto ETN proposal aligns more directly with the UK Treasury’s ambition to position the country as a global hub for digital asset innovation. Per the FCA’s crypto roadmap published in late 2024, the UK is implementing a phased regulatory regime covering stablecoins, custodial requirements, market abuse prevention, and prudential standards for crypto firms. Parallel consultations are underway on stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody, while a May 2025 discussion paper outlined proposals for licensing and oversight of broader crypto activities. The proposed change would bring the UK closer to the regulatory stance adopted by the European Union, where crypto ETNs are widely available to retail investors across exchanges like Deutsche Börse’s Xetra platform and Euronext. Over 300 crypto-linked ETNs are currently listed on Xetra, and issuers such as 21Shares and VanEck have broadened their offerings to include assets like Solana and PYTH. In contrast, the US has prioritized spot-based Bitcoin ETFs over the ETN structure, with crypto ETNs remaining largely absent from public markets there. The consultation remains open through July 31. If approved, the change would grant UK-based investors access to crypto ETNs under regulated conditions, a shift expected to reshape retail participation channels without overturning the FCA’s prohibition on derivatives. By distinguishing between the two instruments, the FCA appears to be signaling a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation, one that attempts to balance market growth with consumer protection within existing legal frameworks.

Title: Bitcoin Pepe sees continued momentum as Uber plans to accept payments in crypto

Uber made headlines in the cryptocurrency space this week after revealing that it is exploring the integration of crypto payments into its platform. While the ride-hailing giant clarified it has no current plans to hold Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet, the mere prospect of accepting crypto as a payment method has stirred excitement across the digital asset community. The move, if implemented, could mark a significant step toward mainstream adoption, given Uber’s global scale and user base. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe, one of 2025’s most closely watched presales, is seeing massive buying pressure ahead of its exchange debut. Only 11 days to go before a listing announcement is made on June 17. According to Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive officer of Uber, the company is studying the possibility of adding cryptocurrencies to its payment options. Specifically, the company wants to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. However, it will not invest in or hold crypto. Per the Uber CEO, who shared the move at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, the plan is to give customers more flexibility when it comes to payment choices. “We’re still in the study phase, I’d say, but stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” Khosrowshahi noted. “Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and you know, people have different opinions on where it’s going.” On this point, the broader sentiment leans bullish. Bitcoin (BTC) remains above the $100,000 mark, bolstered by signs of accelerating mainstream adoption and growing regulatory clarity. JPMorgan recently announced plans to allow its clients to buy BTC, joining a growing list of institutions including BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and even GameStop that are deepening their exposure to the asset. While recent volatility was amplified by the high-profile spat between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Bitcoin continues to attract capital as a hedge, a store of value, and a bet on the future of decentralized finance. Fear of missing out on BTC’s continued momentum has put other well-positioned cryptocurrencies on the investor radar—chief among them is Bitcoin Pepe. Bitcoin is a $2 trillion market ecosystem, and meme coins continue to find traction as serious projects come to the fore. The Bitcoin Pepe project, which stands out as one of the best presales to invest in, is the first meme layer 2 on Bitcoin. It has emerged as one of the most anticipated token launches in 2025. With over $13.9 million raised so far, the Bitcoin Pepe presale page shows that the team will soon make a listing announcement on June 17, 2025. Presale Announcement We’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️ To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to… pic.twitter.com/Dq6o64EKvd — Bitcoin Pepe (@BitcoinPepe_) June 2, 2025 Ahead of this announcement and a potential listing soon, investors are buying BPEP at the bargain presale price of $0.0396. The crypto market is bullish on BTC and SOL, and set to tap massively into sentiment around these two coins is BPEP.
