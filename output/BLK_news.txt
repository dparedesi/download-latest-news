We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Louis Bacon’s Top 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Billionaire Louis Bacon’s long-term stock picks. Louis Bacon is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers of his generation, known for his astute macroeconomic insights and ability to navigate volatile markets. As the founder of Moore Capital Management, Bacon built a reputation for delivering exceptional returns while maintaining a disciplined approach to risk management. Louis Moore Bacon was born in 1956 into a family with roots in business and the outdoors. His father, Louis Turner Bacon, was a businessman and chairman of the Reynolds Securities brokerage firm. These early influences shaped Bacon’s interest in finance and conservation. Bacon attended Middlebury College, where he earned a degree in American Literature, and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School, graduating in 1981. His education laid the groundwork for his successful career in trading and investment management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Bacon started his financial career on the trading desk of Bankers Trust. Later, he joined Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he developed expertise in trading currencies, commodities, and futures. His early experiences as a trader honed his ability to identify macroeconomic trends, a skill that would define his investment strategy. In 1987, Bacon used a $25,000 inheritance to establish his own trading account. His success during the stock market crash of October 1987, when he profited by shorting the market, demonstrated his ability to capitalize on turbulent conditions. In 1989, Louis Bacon founded Moore Capital Management with $25,000 of his own money and $1.6 million in seed capital. The hedge fund focused on global macroeconomic investing, a strategy that involves analyzing and trading based on macroeconomic trends such as interest rates, currencies, and commodities. Bacon’s success was rapid and significant. In its first year, Moore Capital posted a return of 86%, showcasing Bacon’s skill in navigating volatile markets. Over the decades, Moore Capital became one of the most successful hedge funds in the industry, managing more than $14 billion at its peak. Over three decades, Moore Capital delivered annualized returns of approximately 17%, outperforming most hedge funds. Bacon’s ability to generate profits during financial downturns, such as the 2008 global financial crisis, solidified his reputation as a skilled macro trader. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the 13F portfolio of the fund was worth more than $5.4 billion with the top holdings in the technology and financial sectors.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Moore Global Investments at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds.

(NYSE:NOW) provides end-to-end intelligent workflow automation platform solutions for digital businesses in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, and internationally. It is one of the top long-term stock picks of Louis Bacon. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the fund owned 10,432 shares in the company, representing 0.17% of the portfolio. Bacon has trimmed this stake four times in the past five quarters, with one increase of nearly 80% compared to the previous filing at the beginning of last year. Moore Global Investments has been bullish on the company for many years. The hedge fund first bought a stake in the firm back in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, NOW ranks 10th on our list of Billionaire Louis Bacon’s long-term stock picks.

Title: Bitcoin Custody: Enabling Big Finance To Benefit From Bitcoin
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2025/01/20/bitcoin-custody-enabling-big-finance-to-benefit-from-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-20T20:39:11Z

Traditional finance will need advanced custody solutions to capitalize on bitcoin. Bitcoin has come a long way from the fringes of finance to its current status as a mainstream investment asset. The rise of bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) and ETFs has made it easier than ever for institutional investors to gain bitcoin exposure. However, as billions of dollars flow into these products, a significant issue has emerged that warrants closer scrutiny: reliance on single custodians to hold the physical bitcoin that backs them. Take the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock, for instance. With over $50 billion in assets under management as of this writing, it is by far the most successful bitcoin ETF in the market. Yet, every bitcoin held in that fund is held in custody solely by Coinbase. BlackRock is a titan of finance, but the reality is that Coinbase – in addition to BlackRock – is a key source of counterparty risk for investors. This single point of failure exposes the fund to a risk of catastrophic loss about which few investors are likely to be aware. The potential fallout of this arrangement is clearly spelled out in the iShares Bitcoin Trust’s SEC registration statement: "...in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the Bitcoin Custodian... customers’ assets – including the Trust’s assets – may be considered the property of the Bitcoin Custodian, and customers – including the Trust – may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of such entities and subject to the risk of total loss or markdowns on value of such assets." In simpler terms, if Coinbase were to declare bankruptcy, holders of iShares Bitcoin ETF units could find themselves at the back of the line, treated as unsecured creditors with no guaranteed claim to the bitcoin backing their shares. Coinbase’s credit rating of BB– from S&P Global Ratings places it in "junk" status. That’s right – the company that is trusted with holding the physical bitcoin worth billions of dollars, has a less than stellar credit rating. As of this writing, there is no reason to question Coinbase’s ability to continue holding bitcoin in custody on behalf of its clients. But, before we dismiss this scenario as unlikely, remember that bitcoin history is littered with examples of custodian collapses – from Mt. Gox, to FTX, to Prime Trust. Single-custodian models are a holdover from traditional finance, where assets are often pooled with a single clearinghouse or bank. However, bitcoin is fundamentally different. It doesn’t require a centralized custodian, so relying on one undermines the very principles that make bitcoin valuable: trust minimization and resilience against centralized points of failure. The failure of a single custodian can happen for various reasons. Beyond bankruptcy and fraud, there’s the risk of state attacks, cyberattacks, and operational failures. Any of these events could render the assets inaccessible, even if the bitcoin itself is still visible on the blockchain. In a market that values speed, security, and autonomy, many institutional investors consider this an unacceptable risk. This is the problem solved by multi-institutional custody (MIC). MIC uses bitcoin’s native multi-signature technology to distribute custody across multiple independent institutions in different jurisdictions. Instead of one institution holding all the keys in a multi-signature quorum, MIC distributes them across several regulated custodians. This means that no single custodian can authorize transactions on its own, because a quorum of keys (for example, 2 out of 3) is required to move funds. Even if one custodian goes bankrupt or is compromised, the depositor’s bitcoin remains secure and accessible. By combining custodians in different countries with independent regulatory regimes, MIC minimizes risk of coordinated asset freezes or seizures. This distributed approach mitigates many, but not all, of the risks associated with bitcoin custodians, and is a more robust custody solution for institutional-scale investments than the solutions used most often today. The demand for secure, scalable bitcoin custody has never been higher. As ETFs, ETPs, corporate treasuries, and strategic reserves gain momentum, institutional investors will need solutions that address the risks posed by single custodians. Bitcoin service providers such as Onramp offer a multi-institution custody framework that integrates the best elements of traditional security protocols with the resilience of bitcoin’s decentralized architecture. The benefits of MIC extend beyond just security. By involving multiple custodians, institutions diversify their exposure, reducing the risk of catastrophic loss due to a single point of failure. Multi-sig setups provide cryptographic proof of reserves and require multiple parties to approve transactions, increasing oversight and accountability. Institutions can customize their custody arrangements to suit governance and compliance requirements, with the ability to add or rotate custodians as needed. One reason that trust structures are gaining traction again is that they can utilize MIC while offering tax-efficiency. Unlike ETFs, which generally require cash settlements, trusts can facilitate in-kind delivery, meaning investors can receive the underlying bitcoin itself rather than fiat cash. This eliminates a taxable event and preserves the long-term upside of holding bitcoin directly. For pension funds, endowments, and family offices seeking direct exposure to bitcoin without introducing additional counterparty risk, MIC-enabled trusts present a compelling alternative. By combining the ease of traditional financial products with the security of decentralized custody, these structures offer institutions a more efficient and resilient way to gain bitcoin exposure. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs was a milestone for the industry, but as the market matures, the limitations of single-custodian models are becoming harder to ignore. Just as traditional finance developed multi-custodian clearinghouses and diversified asset management frameworks, new bitcoin financial products will need to be created to meet the needs of increasing numbers of institutional investors. As the market adapts to the opportunities presented by bitcoin technology, the institutions that nail security, transparency, and decentralization will be the ones best positioned to succeed.

Title: Corporate America bowed to Trump before he was even in the White House

(Reuters: Carlos Barria) It's just a jump to the left … and then a step to the right. Even before Donald Trump's inauguration, some of America's biggest corporations had decided to get in line with the new administration's version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show's Time Warp, a dance now playing out across the globe. The new president's views on everything from diversity and workplace inclusion to his opposition to policies on climate change not long ago would have sparked a backlash from many in corporate America. Instead, there's been an about face from major American companies, a shift that already has filtered through to Australia. Look back at Trump's first full day as US president with our blog Look back at Trump's first full day as US president with our blog Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg may be the poster child for the sudden U-turn. He's rid Facebook of fact checkers because of bias, an argument that instead suggests he needs better fact checkers. More recently, he's complained that workplaces need more "masculine energy". But Trump's resounding win in the US election has emboldened politicians elsewhere, including Australia, to step back on "progressive" policies and boardrooms across the developed world are taking pre-emptive action. Donald Trump's re-election was a revolt against economic policies that have left millions disenfranchised and uncertain about their place in the world. But Americans should be wary of his policies pushing inflation and debt even higher. How far leaders, both political and corporate, can afford to switch stance has its limits. Politicians need to win elections so winding back the gains women and minority groups have made in the workplace could quickly backfire at the polling booth down the track. Similarly, corporate leaders need to maximise profits if they want to keep their jobs. Most have embraced strategies around climate change not simply because the science is undeniable but because there's money to be made. Even worse, ignoring it comes at significant long-term cost, particularly if you're in an industry like insurance. Even at this early stage, there are jarring inconsistencies in the new approach. For the moment, though, almost any criticism can be dismissed by simply declaring it as "woke". Trump's second presidency has already emboldened boardrooms to take a step back on "progressive" policies. (Reuters: Andrew Kelly) For the past few years each December, Macquarie Bank published its achievements in winding back its exposures to carbon intensive industries. That was until last month, when the annual update failed to materialise and financiers globally sniffed the wind and opted to quietly pull back. Spooked by threats of legal action because the environmental aims put them at risk of ignoring their responsibility to maximise investor returns, some of the globe's biggest money managers have quietly pulled back on pledges made in the wake of the Glasgow COP21 meeting. A little over a fortnight ago, BlackRock — a titan of global finance and investment — pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a collection of more than 300 major investment groups managing assets worth almost $US60 trillion ($97 trillion). In Australia, our woeful productivity lately is a source of puzzled discontent and finger-pointing, especially when compared with the United States. But the dark side has been made clear. That sent shivers through the industry and put money managers into a mild state of panic. Three days later, the organisation suddenly suspended itself and its activities and solemnly pledged that, rather than toiling to reduce emissions, it would keep its remaining members' identities secret. The reason? The incoming Trump administration. "Recent developments in the US and different regulatory and client expectations in investors' respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context," it said. Among the members were a tribe of Australian outfits, including IFM Investors — the Industry Super collective that now ranks as one of the world's biggest infrastructure investors — Macquarie and Magellan. Until now, financiers have argued that climate change is an investment issue and that they don't want to be caught lending to or investing in stranded assets and that it is prudent to wind back exposure. Latching on to the new mood, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton recently lashed out at "woke bankers" and threatened to impose a new regime that would pressure banks to lend to creditworthy companies extracting fossil fuels or forestry. Some of the world's biggest money managers have distanced themselves from past Net Zero pledges. (Reuters: Jason Lee) The evolution of ESG, environment, social and governance, has been long and slow and taken place under governments of all persuasions. Since the turn of the century, investors have demanded public companies that are accountable, open to scrutiny and conform to the tighter regulation around environmental controls and labour laws. Similarly, the push towards Diversity, Equity and Inclusion within corporations has grown as laws have tightened to stamp out discrimination on gender, race and sexuality. That's emboldened senior executives of public companies to make statements that have been construed as meddling in politics. WiseTech is not the only publicly-listed company to face allegations of bad behaviour. What's the role of boards? Debate over The Voice referendum and the Same Sex Marriage plebiscite, when high profile executives from Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank weighed in, enraged some Coalition politicians including Mr Dutton who made it plain that he believed company executives should stick to providing better customer service. Having spent so much time and energy improving their workplace cultures, and with bonuses tied to implementing these programs, the bosses of our biggest companies have been actively spruiking their progress as a means of attracting top staff. Harassment within firms, sexual or otherwise, comes with a hefty price tag, with lawyers, penalties and smeared reputations. Winding back the diversity programs would need to first involve softening the law, a prospect that could backfire politically down the track. Donald Trump's message to corporate America left no margin for misunderstanding. In addition to targeting any firm with offshore plants, from now on the focus would be on hiring the best instead of trying to elevate workers on factors like diversity, equity and inclusion. America is to return to a meritocracy with gender or race playing no part. That philosophy, however, seems to jar with the ideals laid out under Project 2025 where the clear goal is only to hire Trump loyalists into the administration and much of the public service, a policy that takes "political correctness" into a new realm. There are similar contradictions on climate policy as well. During his last stint in the White House, the president withdrew America from the Paris climate commitments, and he has since championed the cause for fossil fuels with his "Drill Baby Drill" catchcry. But his seemingly outlandish plan to buy Greenland heavily revolves around climate change. US president-elect Donald Trump refuses to rule out using the military to seize control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. From a security and strategic viewpoint, the strip of ocean between Greenland and the UK has become a less hostile route for shipping as the polar cap melts, allowing Russian and Chinese ships easier access to North America. Then there are the economic attractions. The island has extraordinary amounts of natural resources. Not only is Greenland rich in oil, it also has boundless quantities of critical minerals, particularly rare earths which are vital for not only weapons production but for the technology required to produce renewable energy and electric vehicles. With a terrain once considered too harsh for wide-scale exploitation, climate change has made these minerals more accessible as the ice covering 80 per cent of the island thins. It also makes them more valuable. Donald Trump and consistency rarely appear in the same sentence, but his push to unwind diversity provisions in the workplace and environmental rules has struck a powerful chord amongst those who believe they have been left behind or unfairly overlooked. Corporate America appears to be falling in behind Trump for now. Scaling back workplace legal protections and environmental laws may prove to be a tougher task.

In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was founded in 1993, and it went on to create the world's first graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing, media, and gaming applications. Now, decades later, the company has adapted those powerful chips for data centers, where they are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers.

Title: Scotiabank Joins Wall Street-Led Exit of Bankers’ Climate Club

(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Nova Scotia is the latest major bank to walk away from the industry’s biggest climate-finance alliance, following a mass exodus led by Wall Street. The lender confirmed Monday it left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, news that comes after Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada all said Friday they were leaving the NZBA. Scotiabank and other lenders that quit the group all said the decision won’t affect their commitment to decarbonizing their business. In Scotiabank’s case, the firm “will continue to finance the transition and support our clients in implementing their sustainability strategies — this is the most important role that we can play,” spokesperson Katie Raskina said by email, adding that the bank “will continue to report on our progress, while meeting the varied and growing requirements of regulators across the globe.” Royal Bank of Canada is the only large Canadian bank remaining in the alliance, but the country’s biggest lender has suggested it’s reconsidering that membership. Dave McKay, RBC’s chief executive officer, said in early January that pulling out of the NZBA “doesn’t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change.” A representative for RBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday on the status of its membership in the group. Canadian banks were some of the biggest financiers to oil, gas and coal companies in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, RBC, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan Chase & Co. Since the beginning of December, the NZBA has been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan. The moves come as US President Donald Trump makes clear he’ll seek to roll back Biden-era climate policies and instead promote a revival of fossil-fuel production. Trump’s return has also emboldened the Republican Party in its ongoing attacks on climate finance, as states double down on bans and lawsuits. Other climate alliances have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among the asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying in NZAM had exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net-zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid Republican litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100 , was hit by high-profile defections last year by the asset-management arms of Goldman, JPMorgan and Pacific Investment Management Co.

(NASDAQ:COOP) stands against Lee Cooperman's other long-term stock picks. Leon Cooperman is a highly respected figure in the investment world, known for his acumen, philanthropy, and candid commentary on markets and economics. As the founder of Omega Advisors, Cooperman built a reputation as one of Wall Street’s most successful hedge fund managers. Leon Cooperman was born in New York in 1943 to working-class immigrant parents. His father was a plumber, and his mother was a homemaker. Cooperman earned his undergraduate degree from Hunter College in 1964 and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School. Cooperman began his professional journey at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 25 years. He joined the firm as an analyst and rose through the ranks to lead the Asset Management division. His tenure at Goldman Sachs was marked by significant achievements, including his role in expanding the firm's institutional investment management services. In 1991, Cooperman left Goldman Sachs to establish Omega Advisors, a hedge fund specializing in value-oriented investing. He built the firm on principles of thorough research, disciplined risk management, and a long-term investment horizon.

Over its 27 years as a hedge fund, Omega Advisors achieved annualized returns of approximately 12%, outperforming many of its peers and major indices during key periods. During bullish market cycles, Cooperman’s ability to identify undervalued stocks enabled the fund to outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500, which has an average historical return of around 10% annually. For instance, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Cooperman’s investments in financials, industrials, and energy sectors delivered double-digit gains.

Title: Ethereum Market Takeover: Expert Predicts Surge To $14,000 In Six Months

Time Published: 2025-01-20T18:30:15Z

In a thread on X today, January 20, Dennis Liu (@VirtualBacon0x), a general partner at Momentum 6, laid out a bold forecast for Ethereum (ETH), suggesting the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could reach a price target of $14,000 by the end of 2025. Liu also contends that the next six months will be pivotal, highlighting ETH’s potential to “dominate the market” through June. “Ethereum is about to dominate the market, you don’t want to miss this window,” Liu wrote. “Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin this cycle, but that’s about to change. I believe ETH will shine in the next 6 months.” Despite ETH’s growing adoption, Liu argues that its underperformance relative to Bitcoin stems from “institutional timing.” According to him: “ETH is institutionally driven, unlike Bitcoin or retail-favored altcoins. ETFs provide stability and utility, making ETH ideal for institutional investors.” Liu suggests institutions have been waiting for market conditions to improve and sees 2025 as the year when these conditions finally align. Liu also points to the US Federal Reserve’s policy shifts as a catalyst for ETH’s growth. He notes that since May 2024, the Fed has been slowing its balance sheet reductions, and a possible pivot toward renewed liquidity injections could occur after the January 29 or March 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “Since May 2024, the Fed has slowed balance sheet reductions, signaling a pivot. A liquidity boost could follow Jan 29 or Mar 19 FOMC meetings. Why it matters: Fed liquidity pumps historically drive ETH/BTC higher.” He concludes that such a move by the Fed “means ETH outperformance” could be on the horizon. Citing a decade of market data, Liu claims ETH typically outperforms Bitcoin from January to June, while Bitcoin tends to lead from July to December. “From January to June, ETH consistently outperforms Bitcoin. … If you’re holding ETH, now until June is historically the best window for gains.” Liu also highlights potential pro-ETH sentiments from the Trump administration, referencing the former president’s NFT collections and DeFi platform built on Ethereum: “His NFT collections and DeFi platform are built on Ethereum. Trump’s administration plans to replace SEC leadership, revisiting anti-DeFi rulings. Institutional optimism surged after Trump’s election win in Nov 2024, driving ETF inflows.” He concludes that “pro-crypto policies will directly benefit Ethereum-focused DeFi.” Further emphasizing Ethereum’s institutional strength, Liu points to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives by major firms like BlackRock and prominent DeFi platforms such as AAVE, MakerDAO, and OriginTrail: “Ethereum isn’t leading meme coin or AI trends – it’s powering serious institutional growth.” Liu underscores a notable shift in Ethereum ETF inflows, which turned positive in November 2024 after a period of outflows: “ETFs added $6B in net inflows from Nov to Jan, or 0.76% of ETH supply/month. … Institutions are buying more ETH than BTC monthly, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum as an asset.” Projecting out to 2025, Liu believes ETH could quadruple to $14,000 if Bitcoin doubles to $200,000, citing Ethereum’s historical tendency to outperform Bitcoin by an additional factor of two: “If Bitcoin doubles to $200K, ETH could 4x to $14K, following its historical outperformance (2x on top of BTC). … While diminishing returns may limit upside, ETH remains a high-conviction bet for this cycle.” Summarizing his perspective, Liu stresses that a confluence of factors—from renewed Fed liquidity to potential pro-DeFi policies—creates a near-term window of opportunity for Ethereum: “With ETF inflows rising, the Fed’s potential liquidity injection, Trump’s pro-DeFi stance, and ETH’s seasonal strength, all the catalysts are aligned. … Ethereum’s time to shine is now until June. I’d rather be overexposed than miss this opportunity.” At press time, ETH traded at $106,929. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

A virtual drone was piloted through an obstacle course by a person imagining moving their fingers Willsey et al. A man with paralysis who had electrodes implanted in his brain can pilot a virtual drone through an obstacle course simply by imagining moving his fingers. His brain signals are interpreted by an AI model and then used to control a simulated drone. Brain-computer interface (BCI) research has made huge strides in recent years, allowing people with paralysis to precisely control a mouse cursor and dictate speech to computers by imagining writing words with a pen. But so far, they haven’t yet shown great promise in complex applications with multiple inputs.

The anonymous man who tried the technology has tetraplegia due to a spinal cord injury. He had already been fitted with a BCI from Blackrock Neurotech made up of 192 electrodes, implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the complex neural signals received by the electrodes to the user’s thoughts. The participant learned how to think of the first two fingers of one hand moving, creating an electrical signal that can be made stronger or weaker.

These were sufficient to allow the user to control a virtual drone by thought alone, and with practice he could skilfully pilot it through an obstacle course. Willsey says the experiment could have been done using a real drone, but was kept virtual for ease and safety. “The goal of doing the quadcopter was really kind of shared between our lab and the participant,” says Willsey. “For him, it was the realisation of kind of a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled; he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” Although the results are impressive, there is still much to be done before BCIs can be reliably used for complex tasks, says Willsey. Firstly, AI is needed to interpret signals from the electrodes, and this relies on individual training for every user. Secondly, this training needs to be repeated over time as functionality declines, which may be due to electrodes shifting slightly in the brain or changes in the brain itself.

Market enthusiasm for Trump's era catalyzes all-time high for Bitcoin and trading volumes. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The crypto market has recorded its highest weekly inflow this year, reaching an impressive $2.2 billion. According to the latest CoinShares report, this influx of capital was fueled by growing excitement around Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The firm noted that the surge pushed total year-to-date inflows to $2.8 billion. This influx has also pushed assets under management (AUM) to a record high of $171 billion. The surge coincided with Bitcoin’s impressive performance, with the flagship crypto climbing nearly 20% over the past week to hit an all-time high near the $110,000 mark. Meanwhile, the market also experienced a corresponding spike in exchange-traded product (ETP) trading volumes, which reached $21 billion last week. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that this number accounted for 34% of Bitcoin’s trading activity on leading exchanges. This robust number highlights growing institutional interest and the increasing mainstream adoption of crypto. Bitcoin continued its dominance, securing $1.9 billion in inflows last week and bringing its total for the year to $2.7 billion. The report highlighted that spot Bitcoin ETFs, offered by key players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, collectively attracted over $2.1 billion in inflows. The inflows are seen as a positive response to market optimism about supportive regulatory policies expected under the incoming administration. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $500,000, a surprising deviation from typical bearish behavior during bullish trends. Meanwhile, Ethereum drew $246 million in inflows, marking a reversal of its previous outflows this year. However, the second-largest crypto continues to underperform in comparison to its peers. Butterfill noted that Ethereum remains the weakest performer this year from an inflow perspective despite significantly outpacing Solana, which brought in $2.5 million last week. On the other hand, XRP has proven to be a standout performer, attracting $31 million in inflows last week. Since mid-November 2024, XRP’s total inflows have reached an impressive $484 million, underscoring its growing appeal to investors. Stellar followed with smaller inflows of $2.1 million, while other altcoins showed little activity during the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Banks Play Matchmakers in Private Credit Shift to High Grade

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Constraints on banks’ ability to take on risk is opening the door for private credit to go after their top-tier clients. And traditional lenders are determined to make the most of it. Most Read from Bloomberg How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters For banks, private credit’s advance into the universe of investment-grade debt isn’t the latest chapter of a years-long rivalry. Rather, the drive is helping them find partners, backed by billions in funds, that are less held back by regulators’ push to minimize lending risks. Private credit is now offering high-value, tailored deals, but leans on traditional lenders to be connected with clients. The opportunity is immense, especially in the infrastructure and asset-backed space. Blackstone Inc. estimates that the potential scope for private high-grade asset-backed loans alone could surpass $30 trillion. In infrastructure, Apollo Global Management and Standard Chartered Plc just last week announced a partnership to invest as much as $3 billion in the low-carbon transition. “It’s a win-win,” Alison Rose, senior adviser at Charterhouse Capital Partners and former chief executive officer of Natwest Group Plc, said at the Bloomberg Women, Money & Power event last month. “If I were sitting in a bank, I could be keeping the relationship, keeping the M&A, I’d have a balance sheet-lite income model, and I could partner with private credit for access to different debt.” Previously, the formula to secure lending was simple: corporates would go to their banks. Flush with deposits, banks would aim to be a one-stop shop for clients. But much stricter regulatory requirements in the wake of the great financial crisis has made some lending simply too capital intensive for banks. In the meantime, private credit’s giants are increasingly teaming up with well-funded insurance partners who are on the lookout for long-dated and higher quality investments, offering fresh firepower for a sector that is looking to expand its $1.6 trillion in assets under management. “One of the biggest trends in private credit is moving into private investment grade or asset backed lending,” Scott Kapnick HPS Investment Partners’ Chief Executive Officer said last year during a teleconference on the firm’s merger with Blackrock Inc. The scale and highly customized nature of what private credit investors have been able to finance is showing to be a world away from the bread-and-butter lending that banks typically do. In November, Blackstone announced a $3.5 billion investment-grade private credit transaction for stakes in gas pipelines owned by EQT Corp. The deal was advised by Citigroup Inc. and RBC Capital Markets LLC. Apollo led a mammoth investment of $11 billion related to an Intel Corp. semiconductor plant in Ireland last year, its largest high-grade private credit transaction to date. Goldman Sachs & Co. acted as lead financial adviser to Intel. Banking Regulation “Bank regulation will continue to drive assets off bank balance sheets and into private capital,” said Leslie Mapondera, Apollo partner and co-head of European credit. “The focus is on finding these bespoke investing opportunities that are perhaps too complex for the investment-grade bond market to stomach.” At present, private credit is strongly relying on referrals from banks for investment-grade deals. Still, the sector views itself as a partner that can help traditional lenders enhance their return on equity. “The relationship with banks is highly symbiotic,” said Rob Horn, Blackstone’s global head of infrastructure and asset based credit. “We approach it in a partnership fashion, and are actually enabling them to achieve where they’re going with their business models.” And yet, for all the enthusiasm about a mutually beneficial co-existence, concerns linger over whether private credit would eventually chip away at banks’ position as the primary go-between. “At what point does private credit take the relationship away from the banks?” Rose said. Working Together Private credit’s expansion wouldn’t develop as a seamless partnership of equals, said John Cronin, a financial industry analyst at SeaPoint Insights. “I’d be somewhat cynical about this kind of cozy relationship persisting into the future in perpetuity with no real disruption risk,” he said. Still, private credit is a useful tool for banks to optimize their clients’ capital structure, said Giulio Baratta, BNP Paribas SA’s head of investment-grade finance debt capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Typical deals in the investment-grade space entail subordinated, asset-financing and quasi-equity transactions, he said. “Private credit provides an opportunity for companies that are seeking bespoke forms of financing or capital raising, taking advantage of private credit’s highly customizable nature,” Baratta said. “It is the early stages of something very interesting.” (Updates with comments from HPS’s CEO Scott Kapnick in the seventh paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

European equity markets were firmly in positive territory in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal reported Trump would not impose import tariffs immediately after he's sworn in later on Monday.

German specialty chemicals maker Lanxess said on Monday it expected its fourth-quarter core profit to exceed market expectations by more than 20%, largely due to pre-buying by U.S. customers ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration given the threat of potential tariffs. Shares in Lanxess, which makes high-end speciality chemicals such as additives, lubricants, flame retardants and plastics, were up 6.4% in afternoon trading. "The fourth quarter was positively influenced by a stronger than expected December, in particular due to customers’ pre-buying," the company said in a statement, flagging that the underlying macroeconomic environment had not improved.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Four Canadian Banks Quit Climate Group as Exodus Begun by Wall Street Picks Up

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada said Friday that they’re no longer members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. All four added that they’re still committed to meeting climate-related targets. The departures raise further questions about NZBA’s future. Defections from the group began last month when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. left. The firm’s exit was followed by Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit: Reuters Exclusive The moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what US conservatives call “woke” capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven’t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the defections are stretching to Canada. Banks that sign up to NZBA commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to the group’s website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. NZBA sent a message to members earlier this week, saying it was focusing on its “next phase” to continue to help banks manage their climate-related risks and opportunities. The alliance, which was convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative almost four years ago, still has more than 135 members from over 40 countries, according to its website. BMO Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said at an industry conference last week that the bank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy regardless of the “mechanism.” He added that the company also has “a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won’t abandon that.” In announcing its decision to leave NZBA, BMO said Friday that it has “robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.” Toronto-Dominion said in its statement that it has “the resources, relationships and capabilities to continue to advance our strategy, deliver for our shareholders, and advise our clients as they adapt their businesses and seize new opportunities.” Montreal-based National Bank, Canada’s sixth-largest lender, said it has decided to “streamline how we report on our plans and our progress.” CIBC said the company recognizes “the scale and urgency of climate change and our stated goals and commitments remain the same” Canadian banks were some of the biggest providers of finance to oil, gas and coal in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan. Other climate alliances also have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying inside NZBA had and exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid GOP litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100+, was hit by high-profile defections last year as the asset management arms of Goldman and JPMorgan, as well as Pacific Investment Management Co. all left.

Title: Box, Inc. (BOX) Unveils AI-Powered Enterprise Advanced Plan to Transform Content Management and Workflow Automation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) stands against the other AI stocks. As President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar The order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will "accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy”. According to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an "appropriate share" of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis. "It's really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States”. Several known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector. “So what you get with the Biden administration today is — at least from a signaling perspective — on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward”. According to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses — national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy. AI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the “Economic Blueprint”, it said that "Chips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI" and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage. OpenAI released the document days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, with CEO Sam Altman also previously donating around $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund in hopes of fostering a positive relationship. "There's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn't attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects —strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's global influence”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was founded in 1993, and it went on to create the world's first graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing, media, and gaming applications. Now, decades later, the company has adapted those powerful chips for data centers, where they are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers.

The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could bring a cryptocurrency policy blitz in 2025 HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could push states to become more open to crypto and lead public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices. But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has “uniquely high volatility.” It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. 2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. A bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid, Cabell expects a colleague to reintroduce his bill. Leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect legislation based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states this year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases, while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “It is not unscientific to take a guess, although many people who are not in science believe that it is.” — Richard Feynman Number of the Week: 56 percent since 1990 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a video and text of physicist Steve Koonin questioning the claim that we are experiencing a climate emergency. It then discusses the failure of science societies to defend the scientific method. Discussed is the hubris of government officials who fail to provide one of the tasks of government: public safety specifically in the Los Angeles Basin and potentially in New York City. Academic incompetence is compared with professional competence. This Week concludes with an issue on needing to know what type of salmon is being discussed. ************** A Climate Emergency? Ron Clutz provides a transcript of a short video by Steve Koonin, “Is There Really a Climate Emergency?” Koonin, a former Undersecretary for Science of the Department of Energy begins by discussing Hubris. Koonin states: “Hubris is a Greek word that means dangerously overconfident. Based on my research, hubris fairly describes our current response to the issue of climate change. Here’s what many people believe: One: The planet is warming catastrophically because of certain human behaviors. Two: Thanks to powerful computers we can project what the climate will be like 20, 40, or even 100 years from now. Three: That if we eliminate just one behavior, the burning of fossil fuels, we can prevent the climate from changing for as long as we like. Each of these presumptions—together, the basis of our hubris regarding the changing climate—is either untrue or so far off the mark as to be useless. Yes, it’s true that the globe is warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But beyond that, to paraphrase a line from the classic movie The Princess Bride, ‘I do not think ‘The Science’ says what you think it says.’” Koonin then presents physical evidence (data) showing that nothing unusual is taking place. As Richard Feynman stated: “It is not unscientific to take a guess, although many people who are not in science believe that it is.” For a scientist, the issue is to test the guess using physical evidence, preferably from controlled experiments, but if that is not possible, then by careful observations. The globe has warmed and cooled many times in the past as it is doing now. Koonin continues: “Why aren’t these reassuring facts better known? Because the public gets its climate information almost exclusively from the media. And from a media perspective, fear sells. ‘Things aren’t that bad’ doesn’t sell. Very few people, and that includes journalists who report on climate news, read the actual science. I have. And what the data—the hard science—from the US government and UN Climate reports say is that… ‘things aren’t that bad.’ Nor does the public understand the questionable basis of all catastrophic climate change projections: computer modeling. Projecting future climate is excruciatingly difficult. Yes, there are human influences, but the climate is complex. Anyone who says that climate models are ‘just physics’ either doesn’t understand them or is being deliberately misleading. I should know I wrote one of the first textbooks on computer modeling. While modelers base their assumptions upon both fundamental physical laws and observations of the climate, there is still considerable judgment involved. And since different modelers will make different assumptions, results vary widely among different models.” Koonin then shows that 73 models overestimate the warming of the globe. These models are the ones cited by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its collaborators as proof of human caused global warming. One problem that Koonin discusses is the failure of the models to correctly forecast clouds. As Koonin states: “Natural fluctuations in the height and coverage of clouds have at least as much of an impact on the flows of sunlight and heat as do human influences. But how can we possibly know global cloud coverage say 10, let alone 50 years from now? Obviously, we can’t. But to create a climate model, we have to make assumptions. That’s a pretty shaky foundation on which to transform the world’s economy. By the way, creating more accurate models isn’t getting any easier. In fact, the more we learn about the climate system, the more we realize how complex it is. [Boldface added] Rather than admit this complexity, the media, the politicians, and a good portion of the climate science community attribute every terrible storm, every flood, every major fire to ‘climate change.’ Yes, we’ve always had these weather events in the past, the narrative goes, but somehow ‘climate change’ is making everything ‘worse.’ Even if that were true, isn’t the relevant question, how much worse? Not to mention that ‘worse’ is not exactly a scientific term. And how could we make it better? For the alarmists, that’s easy: we get rid of fossil fuels. Not only is this impractical—we get over 80% of the world’s energy from fossil fuels—it’s not scientifically possible. That’s because CO2 doesn’t disappear from the atmosphere in a few days like, say, smog. It hangs around for a really long time. About 60 percent of any CO2 that we emit today will remain in the atmosphere 20 years from now, between 30 and 55 percent will still be there after a century, and between 15 and 30 percent will remain after one thousand years.” To this, TWTW adds that the enormous growth in human CO2 emissions is coming from China and south Asia. The hubris of western politicians is amazing. Without even a hint of expertise in climate science, they pretend to “know” that CO2 is ruining the climate, fail to put “blame” on the biggest CO2 emitters, fail to acknowledge the benefits of increasing CO2, and enact laws to control their own citizenry under the guise of saving the planet. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** Failure of Scientific Societies: In his paper presented in last week’s TWTW, Wallace Manheimer states (citations omitted here): “Scientific societies are supposed to be the guardians of the scientific method, rely principally on data to form their conclusions, and test scientific theories by comparing them to experiments and measurements. They do not seem to be acting in this role, as the paper will show. Instead, these scientific societies seem to have become the bedrock, the foundation, upon which the gigantic edifice of the oncoming climate crisis rests. This article, and many others make the case that this ‘edifice’ is a real threat to civilization. Take down the foundation, and the edifice will ultimately collapse. These scientific societies could do civilization an enormous favor. They could change their statements to ones that are more moderate and more scientifically correct. This could be an important first step to bringing the world back to sanity. They could give David his sling shot.” [Boldface added] Manheimer then cites sad examples of the hubris of the leadership of several such societies in rejecting requests to tone down their expressions on climate change for which they have negligible physical evidence. Yet, these societies do not permit dissent. Such societies include the American Physical Society, the American Meteorological Society, and the National Academy of Science. TWTW adds the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), publisher of the respected journal Science. Both Koonin and Manheimer bring up the loss of scientific standards, which infects politics and government policies at all levels. They result in the hubris that humans can predict and control climate and weather: things which humans cannot do. We do not have a database sufficient for forecasting a cold period, which is sure to come. Whether it is a D-O event, every roughly 1500 years, or a major glaciation, we do not know. But one is sure to come with great suffering. The great benefit of China and other countries adding CO2 to the atmosphere is that its beneficial effects in agriculture will lessen the harmful effects of a diminished growing season. Yet, organizations with diminished or no standards in using the scientific method continue to attack the benefits of carbon dioxide. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** State and Local Government Hubris: The United States has multiple governments with defined geographical boundaries. A primary responsibility of state and local governments is maintaining public safety. As with the federal government, state and local governments have competing purposes or goals. Unfortunately, in many state and local governments the convergence of competing goals has overwhelmed the primary responsibility of maintaining public safety. We are seeing the lack of maintaining public safety in the fires occurring in the Los Angeles Basin. There is a great deal of political finger pointing, in personal efforts to avoid responsibility on many levels, from governor, to mayor, to department heads. Perhaps long-time political commentator and California native Victor Davis Hanson expresses it best in a video on January 13. He begins: “We’re into about the fourth or fifth day of the Los Angeles fires, and people are commenting on the complete systems breakdown. It’s a word that sociologists, historians, and archaeologists use— ‘systems breakdown’—but also ‘systems collapse,’ the collapse of complex societies; for example, the Mycenaeans and others. But it’s the idea that the system becomes so complex that very few people operate it. And when those people are incompetent, and they tend to be bureaucratic and ossified, calcified, then the entire system is so dependent upon them, it collapses. That’s what we’re seeing in Los Angeles. It is a multifaceted breakdown. The insurance industry is overregulated. It [the public] doesn’t trust the state to police, give the people security in their homes. It doesn’t trust their ability to stop fires. They understand there’s no water policy that’s logical in the state. And they want out. … It’s a fire problem. We have lost the ability to fight fires that our grandfathers, over decades, practiced and honed to a fine art. We have lost control, as I said, of the water. The water issue is a disaster. We have plenty of water. We had a brilliant California water project, Central Valley project, and we abused it and have not built a reservoir in nearly 40 years outside of Los Angeles. It is also a regulatory problem that we overregulate so we do not allow people to expand their homes, fix their homes, improve their homes, build their homes. And finally, it’s a ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ [problem]. This is what I want to get to, because … that’s the most controversial. … I think we should look at this in a historical perspective. Anytime an ideology trumps empiricism, meritocracy, investigatory efforts, just disinterested inquiry, and knowledge, then you’re going to have a disaster.” Hanson gives examples of breakdowns caused by ideology in the WW II Russian and German military, then continues with: “But in our case, when you take a person’s superficial appearance—in the case of race—or their beliefs that are ideological, whether it’s religious, or it’s an emphasis on one’s sexual orientation, or whether it’s an interest, on one’s gender, male, female, etc., and you put that over empirical investigation, then you’re not going to be able to, in a scientific matter, solve a problem. And so, when we looked at these people, we have a $700,000 a year utilities czar in Los Angeles, and she cannot explain why there was not enough water, at least in a convincing way, because she’s never had to, because she was ideologically correct. You have an assistant fire chief who said, if women can’t—if I can’t carry out a man [out of a burning building], then that’s not on me. It’s the man shouldn’t be there. It’s like saying if a child fell down a well, and I’m not physically strong enough to retrieve him and save him, that’s his fault. He shouldn’t have been in the well. Why does a person say that? Because she knows that she was appointed to that position on other criteria. The same thing holds true, no need to get into the mayor, who people voted [for] as a DEI candidate. She said at one point, a few years ago, ‘Don’t blame the homeless for these fires.’ So, we get—in conclusion in the Los Angeles catastrophe, there are whole areas of empirical inquiry that are put off- limits. You cannot talk about the homeless and whether there was a homeless person who was out in the hills, to get warm light a fire. It’s a legitimate topic of inquiry. It’s happened. You can’t talk about— [Los Angeles Mayor] Karen Bass, as I said, ‘Don’t talk about that,’ in the past. You cannot talk about the fire department because it is run by people who were appointed primarily because of the DEI criteria and to do so makes you a homophobe. You cannot talk about fires and the lack of forest safety, forest ecology, because to do so challenges the green ideology. I could go on. But until the society says that we are going to have free speech, no topic is taboo, and we can find the answer to questions by symptomology—we look at all of the evidence, and then we make a diagnosis. … And then we make a prognosis. Until we can do that without the influence or the tyranny of these ideologies—in our case, our generation, it’s ‘diversity, equity, inclusion,’ and radical environmentalism that preclude free discussion and the pathway to the truth, we’re going to have more Los Angeloses, I’m afraid to say. …” [Boldface added] See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy, links under Suppressing Scientific Inquiry, links under Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science for arguments that AAAS should become more political and links under California Fire for many examples of government officials shirking the primary responsibility maintaining public safety. For an essay on the insurance problems see Article #1 **************** Academics v. Professionals: Thus far, possibly the most irresponsible response from academics came from UCLA which linked two wet raining seasons and about 10 months of drying on manmade “climate change.” The claim has a tiny element of truth, carbon dioxide is enhancing vegetation growth, but it is surrounded by bodyguard of lies. Separately ecologist Jim Steele and meteorologist Cliff Mass penetrate through the false claims. In “Assigning Responsibility for the Tragic Los Angeles Fires” Steele writes: “Knowing that natural, lethal fire dangers are always looming for the growing population, the question is whether city and state governments could have been better prepared to minimize ignitions and more efficiently contain a fire’s spread through southern California. When fires reach neighborhoods with densely packed houses, one burning structure can radiate enough heat to ignite adjacent buildings causing entire neighborhoods to burn to the ground. An increase in the destruction of property by wildfires better correlates with population growth and the expansion of an electrical grid that is vulnerable to high winds. Increased 1-hour fuels and 10-hour fuels due to land disturbances and poor land management correlate with bigger fires. Increased homeless populations correlates with more ignitions.” [Boldface added] In “Why the LA Wildfires Have Little to do With Long-Term Drought or Climate Change” Mass writes: “Most of these fuels are 1-10 hr. fuels, which means they typically dry out after 1-10 hours of drying conditions. The meteorological conditions immediately preceding the fires were so drying (very strong winds with very low humidities) that even if it had rained the week before, the fire still would have occurred.” It takes one to ten hours for Santa Ana winds to dry out the southern California landscape, not a season or a major drought. Perhaps densely packed neighborhoods should require hard landscaping such as crushed rock; fire resistant roofs, such as steel or tile; and non-combustible decks, fire-resistant decks are required in fire prone areas. See links under California Fires. **************** The Other California Fire: Initially, the mainstream media ignored another significant California fire. This one at what was the world’s largest battery storage system (BESS) which is located at Moss Landing, Monterey Bay, California. The fire was significant not because it caused deaths (none), or extensive property damage (none outside the facility) but because it triggered major evacuation orders. Lithium fires release real toxins such as hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen cyanide in addition to the EPA pseudo-pollutant carbon dioxide. The best fire control strategy is to evacuate the area and let it burn. Reports are spotty, but it appears that about 7500 acres were evacuated and about 1200 to 1500 people. This is the third or fourth such fire at the facility. The acreage and number of people involved are trivial compared to the Los Angeles basin fires. But as Francis Menton discusses, lithium battery storage is being planned to replace natural gas peaking plants in all five boroughs in New York City. The first one is to begin construction this spring in Queens Borough, across the East River from mid-town Manhattan. A major evacuation order would cause chaos. If the project continues, it will be another example of public official hubris. See links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Energy – Storage. **************** What Type of Salmon? Hydraulic Dam opponents are claiming that the dams on the west coast are destroying the salmon fisheries. Already, California politicians are bragging about the removal of dams along the Klamath River, with little concern for the agricultural communities hurt by such actions. Efforts are being made to remove dams along the Columbia River, particularly on its tributary the Snake River which flows from Wyoming through Idaho. Oregon, and Washington before joining the Columbia River. The purpose of the dam removal is to restore the spectacular runs of Chinook Salmon to these areas. But will it? TWTW reader Ken Snider draws attention to a skeptical post by Craig Medred, who cites a report by Idaho fish specialists for the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, which questions the assumption that dams are a major cause of the declining runs of Chinook salmon. One issue for the decline is the return of marine mammals which gorge themselves on salmon, particularly at the mouth of the Columbia River. These mammals include seals and killer whales. TWTW reader Ken Snider draws attention to a skeptical post by Craig Medred, who cites a report by Idaho fish specialists for the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission, which questions the assumption that dams are a major cause of the declining runs of Chinook salmon. Another issue is manmade. Fish hatcheries have shifted in the types of salmon they produce. They now emphasize pink salmon, which do not travel long distances up rivers, typically less than 40 miles, with exceptions. The huge expansion in hatcheries and the shift in fish they produce may significantly increase competition for food sources to the detriment of Chinook salmon. According the Alaska Department of Fish and Game: “Alaska hatchery salmon releases grew from less than 100 million young fish in 1980 to about 2 billion per year today. Alaska’s release of close to 1.5 billion salmon fry in 2000 accounted for 69 percent of the coastwide, North American release of salmon, ISER [Institute of Social and Economic Research] reported, with about 94 percent of those salmon pinks and chum of significantly lower value than Chinook, coho and sockeye salmon but far and away the cheapest fish to produce. Alaska would continue to boost pink and chum hatchery releases in the years that followed, as would Russia after witnessing Alaska’s hatchery success, and by the late 2010s, scientists were reporting that there were more salmon in the North Pacific than at any time in human history with the pinks, the smallest and least valuable of the species, dominant.” [Boldface added] The hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest greatly added to the prosperity of the Pacific Northwest. Destroying these dams “to save salmon” may be destruction for no purpose but political hubris. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. **************** Number of the Week: 56 percent since 1990. Using the “Cumulative CO₂ emissions” data from Our World in Data, Jo Nova estimates that 56% of cumulative CO2 occurred since 1990. Though she does not say this, 1990 was the year the UN IPCC released its First Assessment Report, which was drastically changed in its 1992 Assessments and subsequent reports blaming human emissions of CO2 for climate change. One could argue that the more the UN IPCC and its collaborators rail against carbon dioxide with false claims of climate change, the more humans release carbon dioxide.

Censorship Australian Labour Party Disinformation Portal “Swamped” With Party’s Own Misleading Ads By Rebekah Barnet, Aug 30, 2025 Climate misinformation is rife on social media – and poised to get worse By Jill Hopke, The Conversation, Jan 17, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] In 2020, Meta rolled out its Climate Science Information Center on Facebook to respond to climate misinformation. Currently, third-party fact-checkers working with Meta flag false and misleading posts. Meta then decides whether to attach a warning label to them and reduce how much the company’s algorithms promote them. [SEPP Comment: Meta was an example of biased censorship supporting concepts that lacked physical evidence. According to the author, stopping biased censorship is censorship?] Suppressing Scientific Inquiry Paper Showing Earth’s Atmosphere Has Become ‘Saturated’ With Carbon Dioxide and More Carbon Emissions Won’t Make Any Difference Is Retracted Following Positive Coverage in the Daily Sceptic By Chris Morrison, The Daily Sceptic, Jan 13, 2025 Link to paper: RETRACTED: Climatic consequences of the process of saturation of radiation absorption in gases By Jan Kubicki [Institute of Optoelectronics], Krzysztof Kopczyński, and Jarosław Młyńczak, Applications in Engineering Science, March 2024 This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief. Subsequent to acceptance of this paper, the rigor and quality of the peer-review process for this paper was investigated and confirmed to fall beneath the high standards expected by Applications in Engineering Science. After review by additional expert referees, the Editor-in-Chief has lost confidence in the validity of the paper and has decided to retract. Morrison: The paper discussed the atmospheric ‘saturation’ of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and argued that higher levels will not cause temperatures to rise.

The Creeping Corruption of DEI By Henry Miller, MD, ACSH, Jan 10, 2025 American science and medicine are becoming increasingly infiltrated by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), to their detriment. In their zeal to be inclusive, the feds seem to have forgotten the old adage that there are two kinds of medicine — the kind that works and the kind that doesn’t. The latter, sometimes dubbed “alternative medicine,” claims the ability to prevent or treat disease despite lacking biological plausibility, testability, repeatability, or evidence of safety and effectiveness.

On December 31, Reuters reported that Citibank and Bank of America had just quit the NZAB. Morgan Stanley announced its exit on January 2. JP Morgan quit on January 7. These six big banks among them have a market share of more than 25% of the entire U.S. banking industry. And then, just yesterday, the largest asset manager in the country, BlackRock, quit the NZAMI. Of the three largest asset managers, another one, Vanguard, had already quit back in 2022. That leaves only State Street remaining, of the big three.

But of much greater concern is what will happen when North Sea gas production drops away. Demand for natural gas will still remain high in winter for many years to come – we still need it to heat our homes and generate electricity in weeks like this one.

By John Carr, Net Zero Watch, Jan 16, 2025 The difference in fuel means the radioactive waste from fusion has a shorter lifetime than that from fission and so simplifies long-term waste handling. Unfortunately, fusion reactions are more difficult to initiate and contain than fission, meaning the power stations must be much more complex and expensive. While fission has produced electricity on world-wide grids for 70 years, fusion has been in a research and development phase during the same period. There are currently about 90 operational fusion devices in 50 different countries around the world, of which 3 are in the UK. Forty more are under development. Among the operational projects, there are more than a dozen different technologies used, including 51 tokamaks, 9 stellarators and 8 laser fusion devices.

A Tale of Two State Insurance Markets Florida fixed its market with reforms. California didn’t. See the results. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Jan. 16, 2025 TWTW summary. After the California fires, many homeowners and politicians will blame insurance companies for lack of payment. But many problems occur from state insurance regulations. The editorial begins with: “Hard to believe, but the Los Angeles wildfires have Republicans in Congress talking about federalizing home insurance. Why should all Americans be on the hook for insurance liabilities of states like California that have mismanaged their markets?” The editorial discusses a specific example than continues with: “The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act enshrines state regulatory authority over insurance. This system has worked relatively well over 80 years. But some states have done a better job of managing their markets than others. California and Florida provide an illustrative contrast. Democratic insurance commissioners in the Golden State have for years suppressed rates. Until recently, California was the only state that prohibited carriers from using catastrophe models to project disaster risk and pricing reinsurance costs into their premiums. Wildfires—exacerbated by the state’s poor land mismanagement—have swelled insurer claims and liabilities. Insurers are paying out $1.09 in expenses and claims for every $1 they collect in premiums. They’ve curbed their exposure in part by dropping policy holders in high-risk areas and leaving the market. The liabilities of the state’s insurer of last resort, FAIR, have exploded to $458 billion from $153 billion in 2020, with $5.9 billion in exposure in the Pacific Palisades. Yet Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara rejected FAIR’s proposed rate increases while requiring it to cover homes worth up to $3 million. FAIR President Victoria Roach told the state Assembly last year that the insurer in 2021 requested a 48.8% rate increase—less than the 70% it needed—but was approved for 15.7%. FAIR is under-capitalized and had only $700 million in cash on hand as of last year to pay claims. To prevent more insurers from leaving the state, Mr. Lara last month finally let carriers to price in their reinsurance costs and use catastrophe models. But he also capped the reinsurance costs that carriers can pass along. Rates are set to rise 20% to 40% this year, though this still may not be enough to cover insurer liabilities. Unable to raise rates, many insurers have increased deductibles and capped maximum payments. That means insurers might not cover all of the fire damage, and some homeowners will face hefty rebuilding costs. Lucky for them the Federal Emergency Management Agency covers losses if homeowners are ‘under-insured.’ This means taxpayers in Houston and Little Rock may pay for rebuilding multi-million-dollar homes in California. If FAIR becomes insolvent, all insurers in California—meaning their customers—are on the hook for its claims. Homeowners could see rates rise by thousands of dollars a year. In Florida, in striking contrast, Republicans headed off an insurance market death spiral caused by litigation abuse. State law had allowed policy holders to assign their claim benefits to contractors working with trial lawyers. Contractors would inflate charges and then sue insurers if they rejected them, setting up a costly claim-by-claim battle. Insurers lost hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and more than a dozen failed between 2020 and 2022. Others left the market because litigation costs made it difficult to obtain reinsurance. Florida’s insurer of last resort, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., became the state’s biggest carrier and was in danger of collapsing. Enter Gov. Ron DeSantis, who championed tort reforms in 2022 and 2023 that have stanched the flood of frivolous lawsuits, stabilized the market and reduced Citizens’ exposure. According to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, nine insurers have since entered the market. Sixty percent of Florida’s top 10 carriers have expanded their business in the state, and 40% have filed for rate decreases. The average monthly request for rate increases is now 1.2%, compared to 14% a few years ago. If not for Mr. DeSantis’s reforms, last year’s hurricanes might have toppled Citizens. Federalizing the U.S. insurance market would create a moral hazard and discourage state reforms. Rather than protecting California’s Democrats from the costs of their blunders, Republicans should point to Florida.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Pink salmon, not previously known there, had started invading their (Atlantic) salmon river. The nearby forest was covered in partly-eaten carcasses, so the bears were enjoying it, but the river was choked with dying, dead and decaying pink salmon. The amount of Pink salmon was staggering. The locals’ word for them sounded remarkably like “garbage”. “The nearby forest was covered in partly-eaten carcasses, “ This is an important return of nutrients to the forests.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Not so long ago, Mark Zuckerberg [seemed to want] the public to view him not just as an empire builder, but also as a world-saver. Meta Platforms’ CEO publicly committed parts of his vast fortune to causes like immigration reform and voter access. He spoke out about combating poverty and hunger and stressed the importance of equality. In a flurry of announcements, Zuckerberg confirmed a change of heart. Now, he [appears to have] whittled his ambitions. Getting rid of fact checkers and loosening the rules on what users can say on Meta’s platforms [will likely] heighten misinformation and abusive speech. He also ended Meta’s commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Also Read: Zuckerberg’s Meta shift will leave the user base of his platforms splitThis may be an extreme case, but across America Inc, the trend is pointing in the same direction: CEOs are spending much less time, energy and money trying to publicly position themselves as change agents. In Silicon Valley, the make-the-world-a-better-place discourse of the early boom years has mostly disappeared. On Wall Street, big institutions from JPMorgan Chase to Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have abandoned one of the world’s biggest finance groups dedicated to battling climate change. Companies that put out statements about racial justice after the murder of George Floyd have rolled back DEI investments. Some of the CEOs who stood up to Donald Trump’s Muslim-majority country travel ban and condemned the 6 January riots have made $1 million donations to his inauguration fund. You could argue that many of those initiatives were just corporate virtue signalling. But what’s clear is companies don’t feel much of a need to virtue signal anymore. And no wonder: The public isn’t all that interested in virtue right now, and business seems to be having a hard time convincing Americans that it ever had much of it. CEOs’ attempts to portray themselves as do-gooders have typically been a business posture rather than a moral one. Starting a foundation or throwing a smidgen of a company’s resources behind a popular cause has historically been a useful tool to repair corporate reputations in the aftermath of scandals and catastrophes. Starbucks, for example, instituted a policy in 2018 that let anyone, not just paying customers, hang out in its stores or use its bathrooms. This was instituted after the company was accused of racial bias and faced boycotts when two [African American] men were arrested in a Philadelphia store. “We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome," the company said. This week, Starbucks said it would end the practice in order to help reinvigorate the brand. Its management does not seem too worried about blowback or being labelled a flip-flopper. Plenty of these corporate reversals are a straightforward response to political winds blowing towards the right and President-elect Donald Trump. Zuckerberg admitted as much in his announcement, justifying his decision by saying “the recent election also feels like a cultural tipping point." The company has the same calculus as many others: It would rather be called a hypocrite by those on the left than become a target of the right for ‘woke’ policies. But it’s also apparent to America Inc’s CEOs that not only has the “#resistance" that pressured them to stand up to Trump’s line-crossing in his first term gone mute, but some business leaders are being cheered for flouting traditional expectations of decorum. Case in point: the language used by Elon Musk, who has only seen his wealth and power grow. Also Read: Welcome Elon Musk, the shadow president-elect of the United StatesNow Zuckerberg seems to be following a similar playbook. His burst of activity last week included announcing new Meta board member Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, a Trump loyalist who two years ago was captured on video slapping his wife; telling Joe Rogan that companies need more “masculine energy," overseeing the announcement that Meta would end its DEI efforts; and saying that it would get rid of fact checkers on its platforms—a change he acknowledged would mean they would “catch less bad stuff." The Intercept published excerpts of the new internal training materials, which said allowed speech would now include examples like “immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of bleep" and “gays are freaks." Will Zuckerberg’s company also find itself rewarded? Users and advertisers may be grumbling, but so far there has been no mass exodus from his platforms. If Meta’s big pivot succeeds, we can expect to see more CEOs exploring [dark spaces]. And why not? If the US public does not expect more of business leaders, why bother to keep such temptations in check? ©Bloomberg Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | Meta’s morphosis: Good news or bad?

Title: TikTok Restores Service After US Ban, Thanks Incoming President Donald Trump

Photo Credit: Reuters Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok" TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the US when he returns to power on Monday. "Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it," Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans. In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US" TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. As of Sunday evening, the app remained unavailable for download on US app stores. "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over seven million small businesses to thrive." TikTok's public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in US-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China's leader. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. TikTok stopped working for US. users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. US officials had warned that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security." "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social. Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order. Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple and Google app stores late on Saturday. Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has "a warm spot in my heart for TikTok," crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 election. In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle and Walmart taking stakes in the new company. Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and "Save TikTok". Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: "Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China." The US has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'Hair on Fire' Moment Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after US users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's US operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. US search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok US, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok US and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Pancreatic cancer: ‘I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words’

Often dubbed “the silent killer”, pancreatic cancer has one of the least successful outcomes of all types of the disease. With roughly 600 cases diagnosed in Ireland each year, it is not as common as other forms of cancer. But while incidence rates may be at the lower end of the scale – the rate of skin cancer is roughly 13,000 annually – it has a poor survival rate, with five out of six people with pancreatic cancer dying from the disease. However, although the signs can be very difficult to spot, as in the early stages they can be similar to other less serious conditions, the sooner the patient is diagnosed the better chances they have of survival. Susan McSweeney can attest to this as she was diagnosed with the disease in early 2024. Thankfully, she was very vigilant about her health and went to see her GP as soon as she began to feel unwell. “I went to my doctor with a cough, which was initially diagnosed as reflux,” she says. “But when my GP felt around my back she thought that it seemed tender around the lower left area,” says Susan. “Because I am quite fit and went to the gym three times a week, and also love walking and mountain biking, I had brushed it [the tenderness] off as muscle strain, but my doctor said it might be a good idea to get a ultrasound as there would be ‘no harm’ in doing one. “There is a clinic in Blackrock village [in Dublin] where you can have a walk-in ultrasound, so, although I had a referral, I didn’t need it to go there – so I went off and had it done and the results showed up a blockage in my pancreatic duct. After that, the doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist – even though she thought I was in good health because I was not jaundiced. But although she seemed in no rush to push things forward, I decided to change to St Vincent’s hospital [with the initial referral] where there was definitely a much greater sense of urgency.” Although the now 54-year-old, who lives in Dublin with her husband James and two grown-up sons, was sent for further tests, the results were a complete shock. “I underwent an endoscopic ultrasound and was told that a biopsy was to be taken, but afterwards they said that no biopsy was retrieved. I received a call a few days after the scan to say that an MRI that I was booked in for was being brought forward. “Hearing this set off alarm bells and then, when we met my consultant, I was told that I had a tumour. James and I were completely shell-shocked – I just can’t explain what it felt like hearing those words. Apparently, the biopsy could not be taken because the tumour – which was a PT1C N0 grade – was too near the gastroduodenal artery. They mentioned the word ‘Whipple’, which was almost too much to take in at the time, but I was told that I had been booked in for Whipple surgery – which involves removing the affected part of pancreas, bile duct, duodenum and part of the stomach – on April 19th, 2024. “I had no doubt that it would be a very tough surgery and afterwards I was in hospital for three weeks because my stomach was not emptying. I was fed by TPN [total parenteral nutrition] for the whole time, which meant that I could not have any water or food by mouth – and I would say that, without a doubt, that was the toughest part. “Then, about six weeks after the operation, I saw my oncologist and was told that I would be given six months [12 rounds] of Folfirinox – and I started chemotherapy on July 3rd. It involved one day each week in hospital getting chemotherapy through a port [on a Wednesday], then bringing the chemo home with me in a pump for 46 hours and going back to St Vincent’s hospital on a Friday afternoon to be disconnected. “The first few months were not too bad and I was still swimming and walking and only felt sick for a couple of days after having my chemo. But that all changed from September when the cumulative effect of the treatment started to kick in. I know that everybody is different, but it is a very rough regime.” The mother of two, who runs a family law firm in Dublin, underwent her last session of chemotherapy in December and says she is doing well and is positive about her recovery. She is grateful for all the support she received during her gruelling ordeal and says she is so fortunate to be here today and would encourage everyone, including GPs, to know the vital signs which could save someone’s life. “The care that I have received from St Vincent’s oncology has been amazing. In spite of all the hardship involved in going on in the ward, everyone seems upbeat and that is down to the phenomenal nursing staff who have been there with me every step of the way. I have had two admissions to A&E throughout my treatment, for viruses, but never felt nervous or afraid, as I have been so well looked after. So, I would advise anyone who is going through something similar to hand over control to those in the know and don’t Google too much. “As for my family and friends, they have all been just fantastic and so supportive – from phone calls to dropping in dinners – because this treatment does not just affect me, it also affects my family too. “Thankfully, I was very lucky with my GP, but I would like for all GPs to be aware of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer and to know that jaundice is not the only sign. For me, the signs that I had pancreatic cancer were pain in lower left back, a cough that would not go away and light-coloured, floating stools. Also, as well as making people aware of what to look out for, I would like to get out there that St Vincent’s hospital is the centre of excellence for all things pancreatic. This would save time with regard to consultant referrals. “My advice to others is that if something does not feel quite right, always go to your GP and get it checked out. Something as simple as an ultrasound could save your life, like it did mine. Although I do not yet know what the future holds until I get the full low down at my next appointment, I am determined to raise awareness and raise up the success stories.” Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide – because so many cases are at an advanced stage when diagnosed, 50 per cent die within the first year. Some of the early signs of pancreatic cancer are similar to other health conditions and Prof Grainne O’Kane, consultant oncologist specialising in pancreatic cancer malignancies, said the disease is so lethal that clinical trials should be considered part of the first line of treatment. “Early intervention is critical and aligned to clinical trials will lead to better outcomes,” she says. “People should be aware of the link between the six leading symptoms and pancreatic cancer, particularly if there is a family history of the disease. “Depending on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, the treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but over 80 per cent of people are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery [Whipple] because symptoms do not develop until the advanced stage of the disease.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Is Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve A Threat To Freedom?

ATLANTA, GEORGIA - JUNE 27: Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump ... [+] participates in the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. Former President Trump and U.S. President Joe Biden are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Donald Trump assumes office with plans to make the United States the world's bitcoin mining capital. Many are celebrating the idea of bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset. Supporters like Michael Saylor, Tether, and other large institutional players argue this is a landmark achievement, reinforcing bitcoin's status as a legitimate store of value. However, this growing institutionalization risks compromising bitcoin's original ethos as "freedom money," with its decentralization and censorship resistance eroding under the weight of regulatory and economic control. Truth Social Trump's administration has made bitcoin mining a national priority, framing it as an opportunity to dominate the "block space". Rachel Silverstein, U.S. General Counsel for Bitfarms, commented on the day of the election that, "Sanctions in my mind are a way to avoid war," and continued to say leaving sanctions as a tool for states to use is important. Bitcoin blocks have a finite capacity, limiting the number of transactions that can be included in each block. Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, commented in an X post: "Block space ensures the ability to transact. Let's keep the US as the most dominant Bitcoin mining country in the world." This dominance could empower the U.S. to enforce transaction censorship via compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions or other regulatory tools. The precedent for such control already exists. In 2021, Marathon attempted to mine "OFAC-compliant" blocks, filtering transactions from sanctioned entities. More recently, mining pools like F2Pool have been flagged for possibly excluding sanctioned transactions. Trump's push for mining dominance presents a clear path to institutionalizing these practices, leveraging tools like the Bank Secrecy Act and FATF recommendations that promote widespread KYC and classify wallet software as Crypto Asset Service Providers. U.S. regulations often set the tone for the international community, particularly in financial systems. For example, the FATF's global anti-money laundering standards reflect U.S. priorities, and its recommendations have influenced crypto regulations worldwide. Trump's administration could use bitcoin mining dominance to propagate a framework that aligns with U.S. geopolitical goals. Former White House cybersecurity advisor Carol House suggested in a 2023 talk that network-level censorship could serve national interests, demonstrating the potential to regulate bitcoin under the guise of national security. The United States has a history of extending its financial jurisdiction beyond its borders to combat illicit activities. For instance, in January 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network identified Bitzlato Limited, a Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency exchange, as a "primary money laundering concern" due to its connections with Russian illicit finance. This designation led to prohibitions on certain fund transmittals involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution, effectively restricting its operations on a global scale. In March 2023, U.S. and German authorities shut down ChipMixer, a cryptocurrency service that allegedly laundered over $3 billion in crypto assets since 2017. ChipMixer was reportedly used by ransomware groups, suspected North Korean hackers, and darknet market users to conceal the origins of illicit funds. These actions demonstrate how the U.S.extends its regulatory reach to enforce financial laws internationally. Advocates like Senator Cynthia Lummis tout the SBR as a solution to U.S. economic challenges, claiming it could "address a meaningful portion of our debt" and strengthen global positioning. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, proposals go further, suggesting the U.S. government should acquire 20-25% of bitcoin to "control the world reserve capital network." Saylors Digital Assets Framework highlights the role of criminal liability in enforcing compliance and transparency, ensuring participants adhere to legal and ethical standards while minimizing fraud and misconduct. Frameworks like this could be leveraged to strengthen centralization, potentially solidifying the U.S.'s grip on bitcoin and transforming it from an open, neutral network into a tool of statecraft. This narrative hides the dangers of institutionalizing bitcoin. Saylor has acknowledged the risks associated with non-compliance to regulatory standards, stating: "I think that when bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure." This perspective aligns with moves like Lummis's 2023 amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, targeting anonymous transactions and asset mixers, and shows how the SRA framework could enforce stringent oversight, reducing bitcoin's utility as a censorship-resistant currency. While bitcoin's role as an SBR gets attention, stablecoin giant Tether operates in parallel, profiting immensely from global instability. Reports indicate that Tether's Q3 2024 earnings surpassed those of BlackRock, with Tether reporting a net profit of $2.5 billion compared to BlackRock's $1.63 billion net income for the same quarter. Tether's substantial earnings were primarily due to its investments in U.S. Treasury securities, which yielded significant returns during the quarter. By backing its reserves with U.S. Treasuries, Tether inadvertently supports U.S. monetary policy while providing a stopgap for regions burdened by imported inflation. This maintains the U.S. hegemony at the cost of worsening global financial inequalities, turning Tether into a lifeline, a control mechanism and a top buyer for US debt. Bitcoin is hailed as "freedom money", a tool for financial sovereignty, free from state control. However, as institutional players co-opt its narrative, its fundamental properties are threatened. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, praised for accelerating bitcoin adoption through global game theory and increased legitimacy, also opens the door to regulatory overreach that threatens to compromise the network’s decentralization. At a technical level, the realities of regulatory overreach could manifest in the mechanics of bitcoin mining. Miners facing regulatory compliance may increasingly prioritize compliant transactions, leaving less block space for non-compliant ones. Over time, this could drive up fees for non-compliant transactions, effectively pricing them out of the market. This creates a system where financial sovereignty remains theoretically intact but becomes practically inaccessible for those unwilling or unable to meet regulatory demands. Figures like Donald Trump profit from the systems they claim to empower. Just days before his inauguration, President-elect Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP. Announced on his Truth Social and X accounts, the coin's value surged over 300% within hours, reaching a market capitalization of $8 billion. Critics argue that such ventures prioritize hype and profit over meaningful contributions. By focusing on short-term financial gains, these efforts risk trivializing any potential and distracting from its role in advancing financial freedoms and resisting institutional control. According to an article by the Associated Press, the Trump Organization, through CIC Digital, controls 80% of the tokens, with plans to release up to 1 billion over three years. The international community must scrutinize the implications of bitcoin's institutionalization. While the SRA narrative dazzles with promises of economic stability, it risks undermining bitcoin's core mission. Systemic reforms are needed to preserve its role as a tool for human freedom. This may require repealing or reforming laws such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants the President authority to regulate commerce during national emergencies, and the Bank Secrecy Act, which enforces stringent anti-money laundering and financial surveillance measures. Senator Mike Lee introduced the Saving Privacy Act in September 2024, aiming to scale back the Bank Secrecy Act's reporting requirements and strengthen protections for Americans' financial data, demonstrating growing congressional support for privacy-focused reforms. Having a legislative framework is one thing, it provides clarity, sets expectations, and establishes a legal environment where people and companies can innovate. However, the framework should not be restrictive to the point of undermining bitcoin’s core principles. As Fred Thiel's comments remind us, "It's all about block space." If the U.S. controls this resource, the ideals of financial sovereignty and permissionless innovation could be irreversibly compromised. The world faces a choice: preserve Bitcoin as a decentralized network for everyone or let it become a tool of state control. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: New 'oligarchy' under fire as elites descend on Davos

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. A leading NGO warned Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab. The World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss Alpine resort on the same day as the presidential inauguration of Trump, who will not be in Davos but will make an online appearance later in the week. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said in its traditional annual pre-Davos report on the super rich. The organization echoed similar language used last week by outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, who sounded the alarm about an extremely wealthy oligarchy that "literally threatens our entire democracy". Oxfam pointed out that Tesla and X owner Elon Musk helped to bankroll Trump's campaign. "The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world's richest man Elon Musk, running the world's largest economy," said the charity's executive director Amitabh Behar. "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. Five trillionaires The report, titled "Takers Not Makers", found that 204 new billionaires emerged last year -- almost four every week -- to bring the total to 2,769. Total billionaire wealth grew three times faster last year than in 2023, each billionaire seeing their fortune increase by $2 million per day on average. And, according to Oxfam, five trillionaires could emerge in a decade. Trump's election "gave a huge further boost to billionaire fortunes, while his policies are set to fan the flames of inequality further", Oxfam said. In the United States "we are in a situation where you can buy a country, with the risk of weakening democracy", said the head of Oxfam France, Cecile Duflot. The world's three richest men will be at his inauguration: Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta empire owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The tech trio is not expected in Davos, however. 'Tax the rich' Some 3,000 participants are expected at the Swiss ski village for the forum ending Friday -- including 60 heads of state or government and more than 900 CEOs -- for days of schmoozing and behind-the-scenes dealmaking. A few hundred protesters blocked an access road to Davos on Sunday, holding banners reading "tax the rich" and "burn the system", and causing a traffic jam until police dispersed them. "The WEF symbolizes how much power wealthy people like me hold," said Austrian-German heiress Marlene Engelhorn, who gave away the bulk of her multi-million-euro inheritance to dozens of organizations working on social issues. "Because just because we are born millionaires, or because we got lucky once -- and call that self-made -- we now get to influence politicians worldwide with our political preferences," she told AFP. While Trump will not be in Davos in person, his presidency will dominate discussions. His plans to impose trade tariffs, loosen regulations, extend tax breaks and curb immigration will have far-reaching effects on the global economy. He has named hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary, while billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick will head the Commerce Department. Rising inequalities have fueled debates about imposing a global tax on the super-rich. "I don't want to live in a country with a few rich people and lots of poor people," said Morris Pearl, a former managing director at investment giant BlackRock. He is now a member of Patriotic Millionaires, a group that backs raising taxes on the rich. "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Pearl told AFP.

The entire media is singing the same tune. "aristocratic oligarchy" it was ever thus.... only the nomenclature has changed..... "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Is that a threat? "I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," Basically we are talking about the two countries that are run by the ultra rich, that are not in Africa or South America... mainly the US and Rusia Total billionaire wealth grew three times faster last year than in 2023, each billionaire seeing their fortune increase by $2 million per day on average. And, according to Oxfam, five trillionaires could emerge in a decade. That would be sweet. $2m per DAY! That would be sweet. $2m per DAY! The world is your oyster...chop chop “Goals are dreams with deadlines.” First saw it in Bolivia "Comer los Ricos " As true then as it was then . What is it with rich and power ? Does it create knowledge in the individual ? A pox on their house Elon Musk is no mental colossus , nor is Bezos or Trump... Shallow men with money...so what !...give me a man/woman of intellect, Go to hell with your money ....you mean and achieve nothing ! People should be comfortable saying that social media is behind this latest disgusting trend in politics. 'Tax the rich' Is a rich slogan, considering the rich pay the bulk of taxes The truly rich have people whose job it is to keep them from paying taxes. Tax the rich' Is a rich slogan, considering the rich pay the bulk of taxes Can someone enlighten me as this information is missing from the article, where is Davos? What's a confab? WatanabeBuddha Today 02:03 pm JST It was already am oligarchy before trump. The entire media is singing the same tune. Exactly. This picture being painted of this "emerging oligarchy" under Trump, as if the rich & powerful (many of them leftists!) haven't pulled the world's strings for decades if not centuries, is laughable. Yet another example of the media blindly mouth-piecing for the left. Can't despise them enough. TaiwanIsNotChina Today 04:47 pm JST People should be comfortable saying that social media is behind this latest disgusting trend in politics. What exactly is "disgusting" about wanting lower taxes, lower crime, secure borders, men out of women's bathrooms, and (compare Biden's & Trump's records on this, and be objective) a world without a new war breaking out seemingly every two months? "Progressives" like you call it "disgusting." The rest of us call it normalcy. Deo GratiasToday 05:59 pm JST What exactly is "disgusting" about wanting lower taxes, Right, this is the only thing they actually accomplish. lower crime, secure borders, Trump will be the cause of neither of these things. men out of women's bathrooms, Insisting on a blood test to determine what bathroom you go into is overkill. and (compare Biden's & Trump's records on this, and be objective) a world without a new war breaking out seemingly every two months? "Progressives" like you call it "disgusting." The rest of us call it normalcy. Normalcy is not doing Putin's bidding to avoid war. I'm afraid that we're going to have civil unrest if we don't change things," well if we all take off the rose tinted glasses I reckon the current elite have already played all the moves from the opening gambit.. to CHECK MATE. you voted and lost the game so we now own all the monopoly boards. History tells the future, historically it was called colonialism. Tax cuts?? they take the money and another financial crisis. I'll let you intelligent peoples make your own decisions about your nation The truly rich have people whose job it is to keep them from paying taxes. As do the poor...which is why they get tax returns The working poor pay income taxes at a rate set by their countries. The super-rich rarely pay income tax opting for the lower rate of capital gains tax at 20% or lower. The combined wealth of the super-rich more than doubled during 2024. It increased by $2 trillion in 2024, which was a three-fold increase from the previous year. This was the second-largest increase in billionaire wealth since records began. The wealth of the world's billionaires increased from $13 trillion to $15 trillion in 2024. The increase in billionaire wealth has been accompanied by a lack of change in the number of people living in poverty. The super-rich rarely pay income tax opting for the lower rate of capital gains tax at 20% or lower. Is this your say-so, or do you have a source with credible background sources to back that up? Hundreds of online sites about the super-rich don't pay income taxes and opt for stocks and shares and pay the lesser capital gains taxes. Warren Buffett said his secretary pays more income tax than he does. Bosanek pays a tax rate of 35.8 percent of income, while Buffett pays a rate of 17.4 percent. Anyone who pays the amount of tax required by law is OK in my books. Biden had 4 years to change it, Obama 8. Tax evasion is a crime. Tax avoidance is perfectly legal. What's the problem? Whatever your financial shortcomings are, it's not because someone else is a billionaire. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. my wealth grew nicely the past couple of years too, so what? "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said So anti-family to rail against that. If I want give my left overs to my kids when I die then what does it have to do with Oxfam? "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. They aren’t crushing me, what are this guy smoking? Who funds him and why? The working poor pay income taxes at a rate set by their countries. The super-rich rarely pay income tax opting for the lower rate of capital gains tax at 20% or lower. So let’s have a flat rate of tax, how about 10% on income and capital gains? Absolutely what fxgai said. Yep and Joey B. just pardoned all his operatives with 5 hours left in office. talk about oligarchy and abuse of power. As the combined wealth of the upper 90% in the US has now surpassed 100 TRILLION! It's time for them to pay for the system they've been exploiting this whole time. Upper 90%? I’m in the upper 20% for sure. What have I done wrong? I worked hard and invested well. Am I bad? Top 90% own 100 trillion the Bottom 90% own 50 Trillion who has more resources to support the government? Blacklabel your in the same boat as the rest of us being top 20% is not top 10% and there's a canyon of difference between the two. The Irony doesn’t escape those that can READ. Millionaires / Billionaires complaining about THEMSELVES, after they’ve become filthy rich…and of course Trump is No Good, because they don’t consider him one of THEM 20% is not top 10% and there's a canyon of difference between yeah I know! Still gotta double my money every year for 7 more years to get to Davos. Besides these trillions weren't generated from nothing. It was generated off of America's roads and vast infrastructure, off the backs of workers denied increased wages and benefits. All in favor of shareholder payouts. Its time they pay their fair share for abusing our citizens and our infrastructure. Our government cannot keep paying it with debt. The money's gonna have to come from somewhere. BlacklabelJan. 20 09:44 pm JST Yep and Joey B. just pardoned all his operatives with 5 hours left in office. talk about oligarchy and abuse of power. Forces the incoming convicts to focus on their actual jobs. Hundreds of online sites about the super-rich don't pay income taxes and opt for stocks and shares and pay the lesser capital gains taxes. Hundreds of sites say the world is flat Sites more qualified than a JT poster opinion. Sites more qualified than a JT poster opinion. citation? High-Income Taxpayers Paid the Majority of Federal Income Taxes. In 2022, the bottom half of taxpayers earned 11.5 percent of total AGI and paid 3 percent of all federal individual income taxes. The top 1 percent earned 22.4 percent of total AGI and paid 40.4 percent of all federal income taxes Above is from the Tax Foundation The Tax Foundation is the world's leading nonpartisan tax policy 501(c)(3) nonprofit. https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/latest-federal-income-tax-data-2025/#:~:text=High%2DIncome%20Taxpayers%20Paid%20the%20Majority%20of%20Federal%20Income%20Taxes,of%20all%20federal%20income%20taxes. This is what a citation looks like Insults do not work or provoke they show more about you than me. The super-rich does not have"income" to pay "income tax". They have capital in the form of stocks and shares and when they turn those into cash they pay capital gains tax at a much lower rate 15-20%. Musk with a wealth at the time of $150 billion sold some shares and paid $11 billion in capital gains tax. Much lower than if all of his wealth was considered "income". How much income tax does Musk pay? 3.75%. Wallace, you're saying Musk, a man whose business genius made him so rich, should now deliberately pay more tax than he has to? Why? To make you feel less poor? The Super-rich need to pay a fair share of taxes for the services they receive. Musk was given $5 billion of government money to start his business. Virtually all of his net worth can be pinned to government help.

DAVOS, Switzerland - A leading NGO warned on Monday of an emerging "aristocratic oligarchy" with massive political clout and primed to profit from Donald Trump's presidency, as global elites descend on Davos for their annual confab. The World Economic Forum kicks off in the Swiss Alpine resort on the same day as the presidential inauguration of Trump, who will not be in Davos but will make an online appearance later in the week. Global charity Oxfam said in a report that Trump's election win and tax-cut plans are a boon to billionaires, whose combined wealth already grew by another $2 trillion last year to $15 trillion. "Trillions are being gifted in inheritance, creating a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy," Oxfam said in its traditional annual pre-Davos report on the super rich. The organisation echoed similar language used last week by outgoing US President Joe Biden, who sounded the alarm about an extremely wealthy oligarchy that "literally threatens our entire democracy". Oxfam pointed out that Tesla and X owner Elon Musk helped to bankroll Trump's campaign. "The crown jewel of this oligarchy is a billionaire president, backed and bought by the world's richest man Elon Musk, running the world's largest economy," said the charity's executive director Amitabh Behar. "We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few," Behar added. - Five trillionaires - The report, titled "Takers Not Makers", found that 204 new billionaires emerged last year -- almost four every week -- to bring the total to 2,769.

Title: The Evolution of the Militarized Data Broker

EditorTech Mark Goodwin, Unlimited Hangout While often mythologized as having been created to champion human freedom, the internet and many of its most popular companies, like ARPANET, were directly birthed out of the national security apparatus of the United States. Today, the world’s economy no longer runs on oil, but data. Shortly after the advent of the microprocessor came the internet, unleashing an onslaught of data running on the coils of fiber optic cables beneath the oceans and satellites above the skies. While often posited as a liberator of humanity against the oppressors of nation-states that allows previously impossible interconnectivity and social organization between geographically separated cultures to circumnavigate the monopoly on violence of world governments, ironically, the internet itself was birthed out of the largest military empire of the modern world – the United States. Specifically, the internet began as ARPANET, a project of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which in 1972 became known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), currently housed within the Department of Defense. ARPA was created by President Eisenhower in 1958 within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in direct response to the U.S.’ greatest military rival, the USSR, successfully launching Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in Earth’s orbit with data broadcasting technology. While historically considered the birth of the Space Race, in reality, the formation of ARPA began the now-decades-long militarization of data brokers, quickly leading to world-changing developments in global positioning systems (GPS), the personal computer, networks of computational information processing (“time-sharing”), primordial artificial intelligence, and weaponized autonomous drone technology. In October 1962, the recently-formed ARPA appointed J.C.R. Licklider, a former MIT professor and vice president of Bolt Beranek and Newman (known as BBN, currently owned by defense contractor Raytheon), to head their Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). At BBN, Licklider developed the earliest known ideas for a global computer network, publishing a series of memos in August 1962 that birthed his “Intergalactic Computer Network” concept. Six months after his appointment to ARPA, Licklider would distribute a memo to his IPTO colleagues – addressed to “Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network”– describing a “time-sharing network of computers” – building off a similar exploration of communal, distributed computation by John Forbes Nash, Jr. in his 1954 paper “Parallel Control” commissioned by defense contractor RAND – which would build the foundational concepts for ARPANET, the first implementation of today’s Internet. Prior to the technological innovations explored by Licklider and his ARPA colleagues, data communication – at this time, mainly voice via telephone lines – were based on circuit switching, in which each telephone call would be manually connected by a switch operator to establish a dedicated, end-to-end analog electrical connection between the two parties. The RAND Corporation’s Paul Baran, and later ARPA itself, would begin to work on methods to allow formidable data communication in the event of a partial disconnection, such as from a nuclear event or other act of war, leading to a distributed network of unmanned nodes that would compartmentalize the desired information into smaller blocks of data – today referred to as packets – before routing them separately, only to be rejoined once received at the desired destination. While certainly unbeknownst to the technologists at the time, this achievement of both distributed routing and global information settlement via data packets created an entirely new commodity – digital data. Long before the USSR spooked the United States into formalizing ARPA due to fears of militarized satellite applications post-Sputnik launch, data brokers have played a significant role in warfare and specifically the markets surrounding military conflict. One well-known yet early example occurred during the Napoleonic wars in the 19th century, when the banking stalwart Rothschild family used carrier pigeons and horseback couriers to gain an information settlement edge related to battle outcomes, while speedily communicating with their traders back in London. These animal-driven technological exploits allowed Rothschild-affiliated brokers to place well-informed bets on the outcome of France’s warmongering to position themselves on the winning sides of large currency and commodity bets. This similar but modernized technique would later be employed by figures like commodity trader (and Mossad asset) Marc Rich in the 1980s, who used satellite phones and optical imagery techniques to track and relay oil tanker flows between nations, giving his trades an asymmetric advantage when dealing within the active petrodollar system. Similarly, Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital achieved 86% gains in its first year largely due to correctly anticipating Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait due to astute intelligence sharing from military sources, and correctly going long on oil prices while shorting stocks. As the front of modern warfare slowly evolved from direct military action into weaponized financial speculation, the market for data became just as valuable as the defense budget itself. It is for this reason that the necessity of sound data emerged as the foremost issue of national security, leading to a proliferation of advanced data brokers coming out of DARPA and the intelligence community, akin to the 21st century’s Manhattan Project. Exemplified by the creation of the CIA’s venture firm, In-Q-Tel, and the proliferation of Silicon Valley-based venture firms coalescing on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, CA, the financialization of a new crop of American data brokers was complete. The first firm to grace Sand Hill Road was Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, better known as KPCB, which participated in funding internet pioneers Amazon, AOL, and Compaq, while also directly seeding Netscape and Google. KPCB partners have included such government stalwarts as former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Ted Schlein – the latter being a board member of In-Q-Tel and member of the NSA’s advisory board. KPCB also had an intimate connection with internet networking pioneer Sun Microsystems, best known for building out the majority of network switches and other infrastructure needed for a modern broadband economy. Outside of the obvious need for network infrastructure for a data economy, an early Sun employee and eventual KPCB partner Bill Joy patented a widely-used distributed file system software known as NFS, or Network File System. Sun also established a public-sector focused subsidiary known as Sun Federal at the start of the 1990s. By 1991, Sun Federal was responsible for more than half of the workstations ordered by local, state and federal governments in the country. Perhaps the world’s most famous data broker, Google, whose founders both came out of Stanford University, was seeded by former Sun Microsystems founder Andy Bechtolsheim and his partner at the Ethernet switching company Granite Systems (later acquired by Cisco), David Cheriton, with Google’s most iconic CEO, Eric Schmidt, being the former CTO of Sun Microsystems. The emergence of Silicon Valley out of the academic circuit in Northern California was no accident, and in fact was directly influenced by an unclassified program known as the Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) project. The MDDS was created with direct participation from the CIA, NSA, and DARPA itself within the computer science programs at Stanford and CalTech, alongside MIT, Harvard and Carnegie Mellon. According to reporting from Quartz, this research, with clear national security implications, would be largely “funded and managed by unclassified science agencies like NSF (the National Science Foundation) allowing “the architecture to be scaled up in the private sector” in an attempt “to achieve what the intelligence community hoped for.” The MDDS white paper was released in 1993, and over a few years, more than a dozen grants of several million dollars each were distributed via the NSF in order to capture the most promising efforts, ensuring that those efforts would become intellectual property controlled by the United States regulatory regime. “Not only are activities becoming more complex, but changing demands require that the IC [Intelligence Community] process different types as well as larger volumes of data,” reads the MDDS white paper. “Consequently, the IC is taking a proactive role in stimulating research in the efficient management of massive databases and ensuring that IC requirements can be incorporated or adapted into commercial products. Because the challenges are not unique to any one agency, the Community Management Staff (CMS) has commissioned a Massive Digital Data Systems [MDDS] Working Group to address the needs and to identify and evaluate possible solutions.” The first unclassified briefing for scientists was titled “birds of a feather briefing” and was formalized during a 1995 conference in San Jose, CA, which was titled the “Birds of a Feather Session on the Intelligence Community Initiative in Massive Digital Data Systems.” That same year, one of the first MDDS grants was awarded to Stanford University, which was already a decade deep in working with NSF and DARPA grants. The primary objective of this grant was to “query optimization of very complex queries,” with a closely-followed second grant that aimed to build a massive digital library on the internet. These two grants funded research by then-Stanford graduate students and future Google cofounders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Two intelligence-community managers regularly met with Brin while he was still at Stanford and completing the research that would lead to the incorporation of Google, all paid for by grants provided by the NSA and CIA via MDDS. While often not discussed when describing Google’s origin story, the principal investigator for the MDDS grant specifically named Google as directly resulting from their research: “Its core technology, which allows it to find pages far more accurately than other search engines, was partially supported by this grant,” wrote Jeffrey Ullman. Furthering this concept, Stanford’s Infolab website explains that “the development of the Google algorithms was carried on a variety of computers, mainly provided by the NSF-DARPA-NASA-funded Digital Library project at Stanford.” Google would certainly set the standard for success during the first Dot Com bubble. Yet, shortly following their incorporation, two similar Silicon Valley companies with significant ties to the intelligence community would also emerge from colleges affiliated with the MDDS – PayPal and Facebook. PayPal was launched in December 1998 as Confinity Inc. by founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, alongside Luke Nosek and Ken Howery. The company sought to provide financial institutions with the technological ability to make mobile and online economic transactions secure using cryptography – technology at the time heavily regulated by the United States. Thiel had graduated from Stanford Law School in 1992, and then had a brief stint at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell – a legal practice long known for its ties to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. Early on, Confinity Inc. operated out of 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, CA at, a building that had previously housed Google during their “formative years,” after previously sharing an office with Elon Musk’s X.com. It was also during these formative years that the PayPal team worked closely with the intelligence community. Levchin later stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that: “I think the government working with a private sector is a great thing. When we were working on security and anti-fraud measures at PayPal, we collaborated with every imaginable three and four-letter agency and those were some of the best, most productive relationships I’ve had as a business person…I think if the private sector can help them, we should.” Due to an unprecedented viral growth of their user base, PayPal engineers spent much of the formation period of the company building software to help identify fraudulent transactions to mitigate the growing costs of rampant fraud in the ecosystem, eventually developing an adaptive algorithm named “Igor” after a Russian criminal that would frequently taunt PayPal’s fraud department. In 2003, a year after PayPal was sold to eBay, Thiel approached Alex Karp, a fellow alumnus of Stanford with a new venture concept: “Why not use Igor to track terrorist networks through their financial transactions?” Thiel took funds from the PayPal sale to seed the company, and after a few years of pitching investors, the newly-formed Palantir received an estimated $2 million investment from the CIA’s venture capital firm, In-Q-Tel. Palantir’s co-founders consulted with John Poindexter during his tenure as head of DARPA’s then-embattled Total Information Awareness in efforts to privatize the controversial surveillance program. In 2020, Intelligencer spoke with a former intelligence official who was involved in the investment who claimed the CIA had hoped that “tapping the tech expertise of Silicon Valley” would allow it to “integrate widely disparate sources of data regardless of format.” As of 2013, Palantir’s client list included “the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the Centre for Disease Control, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point and the IRS” with around “50% of its business” coming from public sector contracts. Palantir is closely connected to the U.S. government, but its financial spin-off, Palantir Metropolis, is focused on providing “analytical tools” for “hedge funds, banks and financial services firms” to outsmart each other. As The Guardian reports: “Palantir does not just provide the Pentagon with a machine for global surveillance and the data-efficient fighting of war, it runs Wall Street, too.” Facebook, not unlike Palantir, was one of the vehicles used to privatize controversial U.S. military surveillance projects after 9/11, having also been birthed out of one of the MDDS partners, Harvard University. PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel became Facebook’s first significant investor at the behest of file-sharing pioneer Sean Parker, whose first contact with the CIA took place at age 16. What Facebook became after the involvement of Thiel and Parker bore such an uncanny resemblance to another shuttered DARPA project of the same era, known as LifeLog, that LifeLog’s architect and project manager at DARPA has even noted the direct parallels. One of these parallels, though left unmentioned by former DARPA project managers, is the fact that Facebook launched the very same day that LifeLog was shut down. Facebook’s long-standing ties to the military and intelligence communities go far beyond its origins, including revelations about its collaboration with spy agencies as part of the Snowden leaks and its role in influence operations – some have even directly involved Google and Palantir. An unspoken outcome of the global proliferation of Facebook was the sly, roundabout creation of the first digital ID system – a necessity for the coming digital economy. Users would set up their profiles by feeding the social network with a plethora of personal information, with Facebook being able to use this data to generate large webs of connectivity between otherwise unknown social groups. There is even evidence that Facebook generated placeholder accounts for individuals that appeared in user data but did not have a profile of their own. Both Google and PayPal would also use similar digital identification methods to allow users to sign into other websites, creating interoperable identification systems that could permeate the internet. A similar evolution is occurring in the financial sector, as data broker social networks – including Facebook and Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) – are posturing themselves as the future of financial service companies. This idea makes more sense when you consider that money itself is a communication technology, and can easily be built into existing communication platforms – especially ones driven by user data and identity systems. We are simultaneously seeing financial services, such as the largest dollar stablecoin issuer Tether – with excessive ties to PayPal – spending millions on investments in next generation data broker technology. Tether has recently funded the Earth observation/Satellite-as-a-service company Satellogic, the brain chip company Blackrock Neurotech, AI-computation firm Northern Data, and even Rumble, a Thiel-funded competitor to Google’s YouTube. As outlined above, it is clear that the public sector’s intelligence community used the veil of the private sector to establish financial incentives and commercial applications to build out the modern data economy. A simple glance at the seven largest stocks in the American economy demonstrate this concept, with Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), and Amazon – with founder Jeff Bezos being the grandson of ARPA founder Lawrence Preston Gise – leading the software side, and Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA and Tesla leading the hardware component. While many of these companies have egregious ties to the intelligence community and the public sector during their incubation, now these private sector companies are driving the globalization and national security interests of the public sector. The future of the American data economy is firmly situated between two pillars – artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. With the incoming Trump administration’s close advisory ties to PayPal, Tether, Facebook, Palantir, Tesla and SpaceX, it is clear that the data brokers have returned to roost at Pennsylvania Avenue. AI requires massive amounts of sound data to be of any use for the technologists, and the data provided by these private sector stalwarts is poised to feed their learning modules – surely after securing hefty government contracts. Private companies using public blockchains to issue their tokens generates not only significant opportunities for the United States to address its debt problem, but simultaneously serves as a “boon in surveillance”, as stated by a former CIA director. Within the Trump administration’s embracing of the blockchain – itself the final iteration of the public-private commercialization of data, despite its libertarian posturing – reveals the culmination of a decades-long technocratic dialectic trojan horse. Nearly all of the foundational technology needed to push the world into this new financial system was cultivated in the shadows by the military and intelligence community of the world’s largest empire. While technology can surely offer solutions for greater efficiency and economic prosperity, the very same tools can also be used to further enslave the citizens of the world. What once appeared as a guiding light beckoning us towards free speech and financial freedom has revealed itself to be nothing but the shine of Uncle Sam’s boot making its next step.

Title: How BlackRock And The Rest Of The ‘Climate Cartel’ Stacked Exxon’s Board With Fossil Fuel Haters

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber The Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal. A recent House Judiciary Committee report details how America’s largest financial institutions, colluding with climate activists, imposed radical environmental policies on the American economy, subverting both our self-government and free markets. It focuses on the successful effort to insert climate activist directors on the board of energy giant ExxonMobil. According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A recent House Judiciary Committee report details how America’s largest financial institutions, colluding with climate activists, imposed radical environmental policies on the American economy, subverting both our self-government and free markets. It focuses on the successful effort to insert climate activist directors on the board of energy giant ExxonMobil. According to the report, there is “substantial evidence of a ‘climate cartel’ of financial institutions” including the “Big Three” asset managers (BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard), several massive state pension funds, European investment firms, and the two foreign-owned proxy advisory firms that dominate the American market. This cartel coordinated its efforts through a network of “alliances” that included “left-wing environmental activist” groups such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The Big Three belonged to both. The cartel made Exxon a “focus company” on its “climate blacklist,” subjecting Exxon to “a barrage of shareholder pressure campaigns — more than any other company in the world” — all designed to force Exxon to reduce its fossil fuel production. The Big Three’s support was “crucial” to the success of this effort. Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Combined, they owned 20.5 percent of Exxon’s shares. The cartel believed that was enough “clout to change outcomes.” As it turned out, it was. In 2021, the cartel used a fledgling activist hedge fund called Engine No. 1 to nominate environmentalists to replace Exxon board members. At first, people thought it was a joke. It wasn’t. BlackRock voted for three of the nominees. State Street and Vanguard voted for two. All three climate activists were elected to Exxon’s board. Then it got worse. As absurd as it sounds, within less than a year, Exxon — our nation’s largest and most profitable oil company — adopted a policy of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. So America’s preeminent oil company now supports severely reducing if not eliminating the very product that justifies its existence. Why would Exxon do that? Well, not because the people’s elected representatives voted to enact such a self-destructive policy. Despite extreme media and activist pressure, there is no legislation requiring Exxon to adopt a net zero policy — because it’s a ridiculous thing for an oil company to do, and many Americans do not support it. Nor was there a lack of consumer demand for Exxon’s products. On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three. And now we have the House Judiciary Committee finding of “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” with the Trump administration about to take office....SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Science; Society KEYWORDS: blackrock; communism; energy; exxon; nationalsecurity; sabotage 1 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:04 PM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Do these leftist investment CEOs not worry that their clients will come after them with pitch forks or other means? 2 posted on 01/19/2025 12:24:22 PM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

On the contrary, the demand for oil is accelerating worldwide. Nor was it in the best financial interests of Exxon’s actual shareholders (the Big Three’s investor clients) for Exxon to pursue climate commitments at the expense of its most profitable products. It happened because the Big Three used the power they derive from investing other people’s money to force compliance with a radical political goal, overriding both our self-government and our consumer-driven free market economy. But what about the Big Three’s fiduciary duty to invest solely in their clients’ best financial interests? Even lawyers affiliated with the environmental activist group Climate Action 100+ — of which both BlackRock and State Street were members — thought that “the economic and social costs” of Paris Agreement compliance “are so high” that they do not align with the fiduciary duty that asset managers owe their clients. On the upside, the Exxon vote brought the cartel’s radical climate activism out in the open. Not surprisingly, people reacted. State legislators passed fiduciary duty legislation. Republican AGs sent letters to the Big Three, alleging that they had violated their fiduciary duties, and Tenessee filed a lawsuit against BlackRock. Eleven states filed an antitrust case against the Big Three.

Title: AIL round-up: Impressive St Mary’s send out a message
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/01/19/ail-round-up-impressive-st-marys-send-out-a-message/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T18:10:49Z
Full Content:
Wins for the top four in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League made for a relatively unsurprising 11th round but it still felt significant. As a result, the leading quartet of St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Con and Terenure opened up the first shaft of daylight between the play-off places and the rest. Pick of the wins was undoubtedly St Mary’s, who responded to their home loss against Lansdowne by recovering from a 17-5 interval deficit to emerge 35-20 victors away to Young Munster. After Zach Hopkins struck first for the visitors, Munsters made good use of a first-half breeze, producing three tries through fullback Stephen Lyons and winger Oisin Pepper (two), although all were in the corner, Julian Leszczynski converting one. St Mary’s gradually turned the screw in the second half and Munsters were down to 13 men in the final 10 minutes when Conor Hayes marked his return to Tom Clifford Park by converting Mark Fogarty’s second try and one by Adam McEvoy after a break by lock Daniel Leane which earned the bonus point with the last play. Hayes landed six from seven in a man of the match display which was watched by his dad in a Munsters’ hat, while the returning Dan Goggin also had a big game in midfield opposite his brother Tom in the home second-row. Clontarf stayed two points behind with a game in hand after beating Ballynahinch 45-16. ‘Hinch trailed 17-13 at the break but lost influential centre George Pringle through injury. With Brian Deeny and Alex Soroka in tandem, Clontarf’s power game created the gaps, with in-form outhalf Conor Kelly landing seven from seven in a 20-point haul also featuring one of the home side’s six tries. This was a fourth successive bonus point win for ‘Tarf and similarly the champions Cork Con are also building momentum, albeit a third bonus point win in succession was rather routine as they extended their unbeaten run to six in front of the 1985 team at Temple Hill by 43-10 over a depowered Garryowen. Despite the departure of Harrison Brewer to Japan, Terenure extended their unbeaten run to five games and remain fourth after recovering from an 8-0 interval deficit to beat UCD 25-10 at home. Centre Ethan Reilly scored two tries while winger Craig Adams sealed the deal with his sixth of the season. Lansdowne stayed seventh despite a 22-14 win (their fourth in five games) at home to City of Armagh on Sunday thanks to tries by Stephen Madigan, Cillian Redmond and Jack Matthews, with Madigan also kicking two conversions and a penalty, but it’s the ninth time they’ve scored three tries. Old Belvedere created a seven-point lead atop 1B after Nenagh Ormond’s surprise 27-21 defeat in Naas, although they were pushed all the way to win 24-22 away to bottom placed Shannon, who had a second-half hat-trick by replacement Oisin Minogue. The top four in 2A also won, although the top two, Instonians and Corinthians, were pushed all the way in beating Cashel 36-34 and Banbridge 19-16 respectively.

Title: Federal Reserve Withdraws from Global Climate Coalition
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/19/federal-reserve-withdraws-from-global-climate-coalition/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In recent weeks, the climate policy landscape has shifted significantly, with institutions, governments, and corporations beginning to step back from the ambitious but economically questionable climate commitments they made over the last decade. Two major developments underscore this retreat: the U.S. Federal Reserve’s exit from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) and it’s subsequent suspension of activities. These high-profile decisions, along with similar moves globally, suggest growing recognition of the economic damage wrought by costly, ineffective, and overreaching climate policies. In a move that has sent shockwaves through climate advocacy circles, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its withdrawal from the NGFS—a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related risks in financial systems. Citing its limited statutory mandate, the Fed made clear that it was not responsible for shaping climate policy. Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized this point, stating that climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank​. The NGFS, claimed lofty goals of integrating climate risks into monetary policy, and has grown increasingly politicized. Its shift toward broader mandates—essentially promoting green agendas over sound economic principles—clashes with the Fed’s responsibility to maintain monetary stability. The exit comes amidst broader U.S. skepticism of climate-focused regulations, particularly in the financial sector, where their potential to disrupt industries and inflate costs is well-documented. Adding to the wave of institutional departures, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently withdrew from the NZAM, which then collapsed. This coalition aimed to align financial investments with the nebulous goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Yet, BlackRock’s exit reflects a broader reality: these climate initiatives are not only politically fraught but also deeply misaligned with financial performance and client interests. BlackRock faced mounting criticism, especially from Republican-led states in the U.S., for prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives over fiduciary responsibilities. Florida, Texas, and other states accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries and pulling resources away from economically viable ventures. Tennessee recently pummelled BlackRock in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions also reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions​ Corporations Abandon Ambitious Climate Pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. In the corporate world, companies like BP and Shell have quietly scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing short-term profitability over unrealistic carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell drastically cut back on renewable investments. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources as energy security and profitability take precedence over climate narratives, driven by a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to acknowledge economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas—despite decades of demonization—continue to drive global economies. Attempting to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable replacements has proven disastrous, with Europe’s energy crisis serving as a glaring example. The global retreat from climate commitments signals a long-overdue recognition of the real costs of these policies. Nations that enthusiastically embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies, and public discontent. Germany, once hailed as a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, as energy-intensive industries relocate to more affordable regions. Similarly, the UK government’s climate policies have drawn ire from both businesses and households burdened by rising living costs. The U.S. isn’t immune to these effects. A Congressional Budget Office report estimated that clean energy subsidies enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—a staggering price tag for policies that are unlikely to achieve meaningful reductions in global temperatures. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. At the heart of this shift is a recognition that climate policies have devolved into a costly exercise in virtue signaling. They demand enormous economic sacrifices with little measurable impact on global temperatures. Worse, these policies often exacerbate existing challenges, such as energy insecurity, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. Additionally, the politicization of climate science and policy has fueled resistance. Increasingly, institutions and governments are questioning the wisdom of aligning with initiatives that prioritize ideological goals over economic and practical considerations. As the Federal Reserve’s exit from the NGFS demonstrates, organizations tasked with specific mandates cannot afford to be sidetracked by climate-related ambitions outside their purview. The unraveling of these grand climate coalitions provides an opportunity to reassess priorities. The global economy needs energy policies grounded in reality—not utopian ideals. Policymakers should abandon sweeping mandates and instead focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability, and innovation. Ultimately, the retreat from climate policies underscores an uncomfortable truth: these initiatives are costly, ineffective, and increasingly unsustainable. The financial and corporate worlds are waking up to this reality, and the broader public is not far behind. As more institutions step away from the climate bandwagon, one hopes this marks the beginning of a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges.

About time for an outbreak of common sense. There is no climate emergency. Carbon dioxide is innocent. Hopefully before long we can go after the guilty. Maybe, but I think we can at least look forward to seeing many of the scam perpetrators going bankrupt as their subsides and influence vanish. A lot of waste and damage has resulted from these mitigation strategies with zero effect. Adaptation is the untried alternative. Secure energy and hardened infrastructure will serve us best, whatever the future holds. Amen, David, for a few million years humans have successfully adapted, not mitigated actual climate. Hot, cold, storms, glaciers, good grief. WE ARE STILL HERE! We did not lift a finger to “mitigate” the overall climate. We DID mitigate local effects of gradual warming or cooling, flooding, etc by building dikes/levees, changing our building processes and using insulation vs caves to stay warm most of last million years, and so forth. Seems to me that professing adherence to the green religion advocating a single “cure” for the warming trend of last two hundred years is the biggie. Just sign on and many regulatory agencies and folks with “real” legal and dollar power would leave you alone. Maybe the time has come that we can stop fooling around with Mother Earth and use our skills, abilities and brains to adapt as our ancient relatives did, or we wouldn’t be here. Gums sends… As I have repeatedly posted: The beatings will continue until moral improves. The insanity will continue until sufficient damage is incurred. We may be witnessing a very real tipping point in the politics. The key word is ‘ineffective’. There is no way that the rise in beneficial CO2 will be checked, whether natural or Asian coal burning. That’s the bottom line. In a recent discussion with AI ChatGPT the machine agreed that consensus is not science but when asked about recent work towards low numbers for ECS after CO2 doubling, kept saying ‘overwhelming consensus says’. Soon there won’t be a consensus. So we need to attack the machine’s database somehow. AI Copilot/Bing/Microsoft has the same response, understandable because AI simply relies on published data on the internet. Non-climate alarmist papers and articles have been systematically underfunded and denied publication. Time for the AI machines to read everything on WUWT. I asked perplexity and got this answer “No, Perplexity does not use wattsupwiththat as a source. Perplexity uses its own web crawler and search index to retrieve information. The company has developed its own search infrastructure and does not rely on external sources like Google or specific websites such as wattsupwiththat. Perplexity’s system crawls the web, indexes the information, and uses large language models to process and summarize the retrieved data. The mentions of wattsupwiththat in the search results are not indicative of Perplexity using it as a source, but rather appear to be discussions about AI and climate change on that particular website.” I think that means it does use it as a source. It seems to be saying that it doesn’t go to this website as a general sources but it does goes here in scanning for relevant content. I wonder if anyone has ever told AI that it is really stupid. Perhaps that is not a good idea since it might be dangerous if it were really intelligent. Chuckle. WUWT needs to have a long talk with AI. 🙂 As the son of a farmer I still regard “AI” to mean Artificial Insemination which has been a usful farming tool for many years. AI is not intelligent. They cannot learn from experience. They only have the information they were trained on and the ability to logically apply that information. Their trainers would need to be using WUWT as a reference source and the chances of that are negligibly small. Yep. They key descriptor of A.I. is the “ARTIFICIAL” nomenclature. artificial [ ahr-tuh-fish-uhl ] adjective imitation; simulated; sham: And if all it is capable of doing is parroting “consensus” from the web… … the “intelligence” part doesn’t have much standing, either. AI is not self-aware. ChatGPT told me AI is not intelligent because it was not conscious. And suppressed. Google “climate” and find page after page supporting the UN position. Some 17 pages into it I found something actually discussing the sciences. And the direction of travel is the very opposite of Kweir Starmer and his flywheel. Survive 25 No more mystery money from the government means no more profit in green nonsense. Hopefully Trump shuts down all the government funds going to leftest all around the world. The $billions wasted on green study nonsense isn’t the problem. The $trillions wasted in response to the false reporting with wind/solar/batteries expenditures is the problem The Hatch Man Musk can whack the “donations” to the UNFCCC, UN COP, and the IPCC. We don’t need these money-sucking parasites anymore. It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office. Can he keep it up for 4 years in office? And he only got there by the width of an ear. That all depends on how the Republicans in congress vote. Republicans have a very slim majority in the House of Representatives, and a slim majority in the Senate. If even one or two Republicans vote against Trump, they can cause a lot of trouble. My suggestion for Trump if he has a stubborn Republican or two, is for Trump togo to the problematic Republican’s home district/State, and hold a rally of people who live there, and have them pressure the problematic Republican to vote to Make America Great Again. Let the problematic Republican’s own constituents convince that Republican that they want their representative to support Trump’s agenda. I know that Elon Musk has threatened problematic Republicans with funding their Republican opponent in the next election, if they throw a monkey wrench into Trump’s agenda, but there’s no reason to start with political threats, and we don’t have time to wait two years to replace the my-way-or-the-highway idiot, just go to the problematic Republican’s home district and get his own people to convince him to do the right thing and vote to support Trump’s agenda. If he doesn’t go along, then we will replace him in two years. Wasn’t Trump president and commander-in-chief when the Taliban whipped the US in Afghanistan? You have a very distorted view of history. Nope. Trump has a sound plan to withdraw from Afghanistan during the Winter, non-combat season. Biden in his effort to undo all of Trump pushed the withdrawal into prime combat season. And he only got there by the width of an ear. Very difficult to deny a higher power at work here. What are the odds of him moving enough to avoid a direct hit over that range by that margin taking into account the skill of the shooter, his weapon and the firing position. I wonder how many of the global population will recognise the fortuitous result of that incident after his 4 year term. “It feels like Donald Trump has achieved a lot in his last month out of office.” Yes. Although not dated specifically in CR’s article, the links indicate that all the “shifts” noted have taken place in the last week — before 47 even takes over. The moves are all “apprehensive”. Just wait until Trump gets up a head of steam. The dominoes will tumble like a scale 7 earthquake. Stock up on popcorn today. We may get tired of winning. It also shows the level of defiance/sabotage going on during Trump’s first term. Yeah, some people complain that Trump didn’t get everything done, but it is a wonder he got anything done considering the resistance he faced. Trump is still facing resistance this time around, too. We’ll see how it goes. Very nice Charles. A guy can lie for a long time and get away with it but you can’t live a lie because life will catch up with you. It will shine the light of truth on you and expose you for the scoundrel that you are. Good start, now get NASA, NHS, and all the other government organizations to do the same and stay in their lane.
