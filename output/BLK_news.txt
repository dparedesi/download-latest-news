The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted a go-ahead to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) to list options trading for several spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development comes amidst the massive inflows recorded by these Bitcoin ETFs in the past week. According to filings by the SEC, NYSE and Cboe have obtained permission to list and trade options on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. Based on NYSE’s proposed rule change, the US securities regulator has allowed the exchange to provide options trading for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC (BTC), and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Meanwhile, Cboe has been greenlighted to list and trade options on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Interestingly, both exchanges gained “accelerated approval” from the Commission which means authorization was granted before the usual 30-day public comment period on the proposed amendments had elapsed according to Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, an accelerated approval usually happens when the Commission decides that waiting for a full 30 days is not necessary for the public protection of market stability or there is a good cause to fast-track the process as in the case of NYSE and Cboe. Commenting on this development, Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchumas has expressed no surprise although applauding the SEC’s decision. Balchunas said: They approved same thing for Nasdaq recently so not a big surprise but still good news as SEC was big hurdle. We hearing good things about the rest of process altho exact timeline for listing date still unclear. Before NYSE and Cboe, the SEC had approved Nasdaq to list and trade options on the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This represents the first approval for spot Bitcoin ETF options trading and came nine months after application with the SEC. Options trading refers to buying and selling contracts that grant traders the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset e.g.ETF at a predetermined price, albeit within a specific time frame. With six of the active spots of Bitcoin ETFs eligible for options trading, investors in these institutional funds are exposed to new trading strategies in terms of hedging against volatility or evening leveraging on Bitcoin’s price movement. Bitwise executive Jeff Park sheds more light on these in what he calls “free leverage”. Park said: ETF options will have cross-margining capabilities in multi-asset portfolios, which single-asset exchanges like Derbit can never provide. Only spot ETF options can leverage your GLD, SPY, HYG ETFs, bonds, and cross-margin to achieve uncharted capital efficiency-the closest thing to free leverage. Ultimately, this will result in increased institutional interest in an already booming spot Bitcoin ETF market which boasts over $65 billion in total net assets in ten months of trading.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) Is A Stock With High Consensus ROE
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-uber-technologies-inc-155809667.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:58:09Z

We recently looked at Goldman Sachs’ Stocks With Highest Consensus Returns: 42 Stocks With The Highest Consensus ROE. In this piece, we will look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) ranks in the list. As the fourth quarter of 2024 settles in, the narrative surrounding stocks on Wall Street is starting to shift. This is unsurprising since the beginning of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cycles stands to change economic conditions in America. These will naturally affect businesses, and cyclical stocks along with financials should see an improved outlook. For instance, consider two reports by investment bank Morgan Stanley. One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Consensus ROE: 45% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 145 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is the largest ride sharing services provider in the US. The firm has leveraged its online platform to provide additional services as well such as food delivery. In fact, along with being the largest ride sharing company, the firm is also the second biggest food delivery company in the US after DoorDash. As a result, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) benefits from earning from multiple businesses. These also enable the firm to target high growth initiatives such as air taxis, autonomous ride sharing vehicles, and dedicated shuttles. Starting from air taxis, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has invested $125 million into Joby Aviation as of 2020. For autonomous vehicles and shuttles, the firm has teamed up with General Motors to create a robotaxi service, and in October, the firm started a pilot program in New York to ferry users between Midtown New York and LaGuardia Airport. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s existing market position means that it remains the preferred partner for autonomous vehicles, which could work in its favor down the road. RiverPark Advisors mentioned Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.4 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.8 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $165 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.” Overall UBER ranks 5th on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

One of these was released before the interest rate cut, and it covered the bank’s thoughts about the stock market and the US economy for September. The other came in October, after the rate cut. In its September report, MS laid out three scenarios for the flagship S&P index’s performance for the rest of this year. The best case scenario posits that the index would close at 5,650 points in the near term, while the “attractive” and “fair” scenarios predict a closing of 5,200 and 5,350 points, respectively. Yet, the market has outperformed even the best scenario, as its recent reading is 5,764. READ ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock The bank also shares that inflation is finally dropping in America. This fact is explained through the S&P’s second quarter earnings performance. In fact, the shifting inflationary trends have set new highs for a decade when we consider sales and earnings surprises for the index according to MS. Its data shows that when inflation was soaring in Q4 2022, the net of positive and negative EPS surprises stood in lowest quintile since businesses struggled with costs. This was despite the fact that during the same time period the net of positive and negative revenue surprises was in the 70% percentile. However, now that inflation has dropped, data for the second quarter earnings season shows that the EPS surprise was in the uppermost quintile (above 80%) while the revenue surprise had dropped to roughly 35%. This data covers the past ten years, and as a result, it illustrates the momentous shifts that the market is undergoing right now. Since interest rates are the hottest topic on Wall Street, MS also commented on its expectations for them. At the September start, the bank posited that markets were expecting 100 basis points of cuts by 2024 end. The bank shared that it thought “this looks aggressive unless the U.S. economy has a hard landing, but this is not our base case.” With September’s 50 basis points cut out of the way, these expectations have remained unchanged as the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that for the Fed’s November and December meetings, the market has set the probabilities for a 25 basis point cut in each at 85.5% and 82.1%, respectively. These cuts are important for determining the market’s direction, as MS’ data shows that when economic activity as measured by the ISM Manufacturing Index sat at ~67 in 2010, the S&P’s 12 month total return was 30%. Shifting gears to the October report, MS cautions that while historically equities have outperformed following the first Fed rate cut, elevated valuations, and “consensus forecasting of EPS acceleration rather than decline, equities upside after the first cut may prove more limited this cycle.” The bank’s key stock market insight from its October report comes through its comments about cyclical stocks, though. MS shares that as upward economic growth surprises softened from April through August, “sector and factor trends skewed defensive, consistent with softer economic growth.” However, this might not be the case moving forward, as shown by the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index. MS outlines that this index had bottomed out in August with a ~-25 reading, which had jumped to roughly -12 in September. This trend was mirrored in the difference between global cyclical and defensive sectors, with the reading also moving upward as the economic surprises jumped. These factors are key when we analyze Goldman Sachs’ list of stocks with the highest expected ROE since the bank believes that stock quality will be determined by economic growth and economic rates. The bank also recently upped its 2024 closing target for the S&P to 6,000 points. This was the fourth revision of its target and a sizeable increase from the previous estimate of 5,600 points. This increase was also accompanied by optimism for the index’s earnings. GS now believes that S&P’s 2025 earnings will sit at $268, for a 4.7% revision from the previous estimate of $256. Its 2024 estimate is unchanged, though, and its value of $241 implies that earnings next year will grow by 11.2%. As for the next 12 months, GS believes that the S&P will sit at 6,300 points, for an 8.9% growth over its recent value of 5,779. As MS’ data pointed out that EPS surprises are growing as inflation tames, Goldman is also of a similar view. This is because the bank’s chief US equity strategist David Kostin shares that the upward EPS revision is reflective of the fact that the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” In a later note, the analyst outlined that “Over the past year, performance of several quality factors has tracked the broad trajectory of market views on growth and monetary policy.” Kostin added that “A positive jobs print could prompt some investors to rotate out of expensive ‘quality’ stocks into less-loved lower quality firms as the market would likely price lower odds of substantial labor market weakening.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ stocks with the highest consensus ROE, we used the bank’s latest list of 50 such stocks and chose those with a 5% or higher consensus ROE. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior manager studying a market index alongside a team of young stock market analysts. Consensus ROE: 5% Number of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 85 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the dominant player in the global electric vehicle industry. Along with EVs, the firm also makes other products such as energy storage equipment to enable building owners to rely on solar energy for their power. However, 84% of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s revenue comes from electric vehicles, which makes the stock vulnerable to downswings in the cyclical product category. This has also been the case lately, with the stock down 3% year to date and 8.6% over the past year. The drops are due to a slowdown in the EV industry stemming from high interest rates and weakening demand. Additionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long enjoyed the status of being one of the few large scale EV makers in the world. However, with new companies entering the market, the firm will have to leverage existing economies of scale to compete on the cost front – a strategy that could erode margins and affect profitability. During this critical period, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s scale, as is evident by its 1.85 million EV production capacity in 2023, its sizeable data repository of 1.3 billion miles for training autonomous systems, and a semi diversified business that saw energy storage revenue double to $3 billion in Q2 should come to the firm’s aid. However, Goldman was of mixed mind after Tesla’s We, Robot event as it criticized a lack of detail for business plans but sounded optimistic about the humanoid robot prototype Optimus. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period” Overall TSLA ranks 41st on our list of stocks with the highest consensus ROE according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Arm Holdings plc (ARM) Teams Up with Industry Leaders to Launch Advanced AI CPU Chiplet Platform for Cloud and HPC Applications

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Joining CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss the latest market trends, Mary Ann Bartels of Sanctuary Wealth remains bullish on 2024, expecting the S&P 500 to hit 6,000 by year-end. As the Fed recalibrates to an easier monetary policy and corporate profits continue to grow, the chief investment strategist believes the market will maintain its rally as we approach November and December. As of today, the S&P is around 3% shy of hitting 6,000. This is only eight months after it eclipsed 5,000 for the first time. Monday, October 14 proved to be a new record for the S&P, marking the bull market's second anniversary. The milestone represents an impressive recovery over the last two years when stock prices surged despite ongoing recession concerns and elevated interest rates. S&P 500 reaching all-time highs comes amidst optimism on Wall Street as the third-quarter earnings season kicks in. With corporate earnings proving resilient amidst high rates and moderating inflation, and investors piling into stocks poised to benefit the most from the generative AI craze- the market sentiment remains bullish as traders anticipate strong financial results and continued growth in technology-driven sectors. Artificial Intelligence-linked stocks have been leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. On October 14, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both reached all-time highs, closing up 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gained 1% and approached a record of its own. Despite these recent gains, high valuations will seemingly pose a challenge for continued growth, with analysts noting that this could be a sign that the bull market may be nearing its end. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Strategists also caution that moving forward, continued gains will depend on identifying sectors with strong earnings growth. As Artificial Intelligence is poised to significantly influence future market performance, the focus will shift to AI's impact on profitability across various industries. According to Citi equity strategist Scott Chronert, for AI to continue driving market gains, “you’ve got to have more companies delivering on the AI promise via margins and profitability metrics.” At the same time, it is also true that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, upcoming US presidential elections, and natural disasters may pose risks to the market’s climb. Nevertheless, ongoing AI innovation and a resilient economy are still in support of further gains. In light of this, Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, further notes how third-quarter results could act as a catalyst for market gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. "We continue to expect increased volatility for technology stocks in the near term,” the note states. “However, we remain positive on the tech sector as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI). Against this backdrop, we believe volatility should be utilized to build long-term AI exposure." According to the bank, October has historically been a turbulent month for tech stocks, citing how monthly realized volatility for the Nasdaq 100 over the past 40 years has been 26% in October, while other months have an average of 22%. Regardless, strong AI fundamentals and the upcoming earnings season will reaffirm positive growth trajectories. It is further stated that the overall AI semiconductor industry is expected to grow sharply, reaching $168 billion by the end of the year. Tech and AI companies are also anticipated to “beat and raise” expectations for the September quarter. Furthermore, the ongoing transition to smaller, more powerful AI chips will drive significant performance improvements, fueling further investment in the sector.

Title: BlackRock in Talks With Crypto Exchanges About Using Its BUIDL Token As Derivatives Collateral: Report

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly in talks with numerous crypto exchange platforms about using its proprietary token BUIDL as collateral for derivatives contracts. According to a new report by Bloomberg, anonymous people familiar with the matter say the world’s largest asset manager is exploring the idea of utilizing BUIDL – the crypto asset related to the firm’s tokenized mutual fund – as collateral for trading derivatives contracts. BUIDL, which launched in March of this year and stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token built on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that offers blue-chip traders yields. Bloomberg says the crypto exchanges BlackRock is in talks with include Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, as well as OKX and Deribit. Previously, it was reported that the fund invests in cash, US Treasury Bills, and repurchase agreements and sends dividends directly to investors’ wallets as new tokens every month. As stated by Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a press release issued by Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, “[BUIDL] is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients.” In April, stablecoin issuer Circle launched a new smart contract function that permits holders of BUIDL to convert their tokens into USDC. At the time, Circle chief executive Jeremy Allaire said that the new functionality would allow “investors to move out of tokenized assets at speed, lowering costs and removing friction.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: BlackRock Seeks To Push BUIDL As Derivative Collateral In Crypto Market – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-push-buidl-crypto-derivative-collateral/
Time Published: 2024-10-19T15:00:28Z
Full Content:
The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, aims to expand its foray in the digital asset industry following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024. In a new venture, the American asset manager is attempting to push the adoption of its money-market token BUIDL as a collateral asset in the crypto derivative market. According to a Friday report by Bloomberg, BlackRock has begun marketing BUIDL as collateral in the crypto derivative market. For context, BUIDL – which stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund – is a tokenized fund issued on the Ethereum blockchain offering institutional investors access to achieving US dollar yields. Similar to stablecoins, BUIDL is pegged to a stable value of $1 per unit and invests in assets such as US dollars, US treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Following its launch in March, BUIDL has experienced remarkable growth amassing $550 million in AUM to become the largest tokenized fund in the market. In order to facilitate further growth of BUIDL, Bloomberg states that BlackRock in conjunction with its broker Securitize has begun discussions with major exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit to introduce the money-market token as a collateral asset for derivative trading on their respective platforms. BlackRock will aim to charge traders a management fee of 0.5% in line with its current standard policy. However, the use of BUIDL is only restricted to eligible institutional investors with a minimum investment quota of $5 million. Currently, crypto prime brokers such as FalconX and Hidden Road have already authorized their customers to use BUIDL as a collateral asset for trading. However, a potential entry into the derivatives market of powerhouse exchanges such as Binance and OKX presents a significant opportunity to exponentially increase the market influence of the tokenized find. In launching BUIDL in the crypto derivative trading, BlackRock will experience powerful opposition from Tether’s USDT which ranks as the most common asset for collateral in the crypto derivative market. USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin and third-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $120 billion. At present, there are no confirmative comments from BlackRock or the mentioned crypto exchanges on any planned introduction of BUIDL in crypto derivative trading. However, the successful execution of this initiative would represent another outstanding milestone in the investment firm’s digital asset campaign. BlackRock already presents the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with respective net assets of $25.79 billion and $1.26 billion according to data from SoSoValue. By securing a collateral asset in the crypto derivative market, which produced nearly three-quarters of crypto trading volume in September, BlackRock could expand its reach in the digital asset industry.

Title: Majority of children on spinal waiting list will have surgery or date by end of year - Donnelly

The “majority” of 138 children who are currently on an “active” waiting list for spinal surgery will have had their surgery performed or will have a date for their surgery before the end of 2024, according to Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly. A spokeswoman for the health minister said: “The Minister for Health expects the majority of those currently on the active waiting list to have received a date for surgery / have had their surgery before the end of the year.” The Minister’s office was asked to clarify the position following comments made by Limerick Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins, who said that the Minister told him that the waiting list would be reduced by at least 100 patients by the end of this year, leaving 38 patients on the active list. When asked for clarity on the figures Minister Donnelly’s office replied that “as of September 27th, 362 spinal surgeries have been completed this year to date”. It explained that while “there are currently 138 children actively waiting for a date for their surgery”, a total of “38 children are currently confirmed for outsourced initiatives in Ireland and abroad”, which included “16 children (who) have received a date to come in for surgery at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh”. According to CHI newly published figures, there were 248 children on the spinal surgery waiting list as of September 27th, including 138 patients who were ready for surgery and waiting for a date; 18 patients who were assigned a surgery date; 35 patients who had “an initial episode of care” and required a further procedure; and 57 patients who were suspended from the waiting list due to clinical reasons (11 patients), personal reasons (8 patients), or patients who were confirmed to have their surgery in a non CHI hospital under a CHI initiative (38 patients). “A number of international outsourcing initiatives have been finalised for children waiting on spinal surgeries. While this option is not suitable for all children waiting on spinal surgeries, dozens of children and families will be able to avail of the option to get their surgery abroad - They include Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London,” Minister Donnelly’s office. “National outsourcing of spinal patients to Blackrock Clinic and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is already in progress.” The Minister’s office said: “CHI has implemented an extended operating theatre day and a ring-fenced theatre for spinal surgery to increase the number of procedures that are being carried out”. A Paediatric Spinal Taskforce, set up by the health minister, is being chaired by senior counsel Mark Connaughton, and includes patient advocacy groups, representatives from CHI, the HSE, the Ombudsman for Children, and the Department of Health. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement? Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980, will be next to retire after the baby boom. It’s a generation largely defined by financial uncertainty: Generation X was the first to cope without ubiquitous workplace pensions, relying instead on a new savings tool called the 401(k). The Great Recession of 2008 stands as the generation’s defining economic event. Now, with the oldest Gen Xers pushing 60, the cohort may not be ready for its next life stage. A Wealth Watch survey from insurer New York Life is one of several recent reports that portray much of Generation X as woefully unprepared for their looming retirement. Fewer than half of Generation X, or 46%, are “actively planning for retirement,” New York Life found, even as they approach the milestone. Most of Generation X, or 70%, think they will retire “later than expected,” the survey found, “or not at all.” Only one-quarter of Gen-Xers believe they will retire on time. The survey, released in September, reached 2,230 adults. “There are a whole lot of Gen Xers who are finding themselves resigned to the fact that they’re basically going to be working forever,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, the personal finance site. Generation X’s retirement fears are not unwarranted. Gen Xers ages 45 to 54 had a median net worth of about $247,000 in 2022, according to the federal Survey of Consumer Finances. That’s less money than baby boomers had at the same age. Boomers in the 45-54 age group had a median net worth of about $265,000 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. The contrast suggests Generation X has struggled more than other age groups to recover from the Great Recession of 2008. “I think there’s this cumulative wear and tear of different circumstances Gen X has had throughout their lives,” said KC Boas, head of retirement thought leadership and marketing at BlackRock, the global investment firm. Many in Generation X entered the workforce around the time of the dot-com bubble, the tech-stock boom that went bust in 2000, sending the stock market tumbling. Several years later, many Gen Xers were in their prime earning years when the Great Recession hit. Every generation suffered in 2008, but economic research suggests Gen X suffered more than most. “Older generations were hit much harder, in some ways, because they had more to lose,” said Catherine Collinson, CEO of the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. Late baby boomers, born between 1960 and 1965, were also in their top earning years when the Great Recession descended. Today, the “Beatlemania boomers” have much less retirement savings than Americans born in the 1950s or earlier. They and Gen X suffered a similar fate. Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, have fared better. The millennial generation is in a stronger financial position now than Gen X was at the same age, according to a new LendingTree analysis. As of 2022, millennials had a median net worth of $84,941, LendingTree reports. Generation X had a lower net worth at the same age: $78,333, after adjusting for inflation. Millennials are also better-off financially than boomers were at the same age. But boomers are much more likely than Gen X or millennials to have workplace pensions, a guaranteed source of retirement income. Generation X entered the workforce as workplace pensions were fading, leaving most workers to build their own retirement savings with 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. But 401(k) plans were few and far between in the early years. Partly for that reason, many Gen Xers got a late start in retirement saving. “This all happened without access to education and guidance,” said Jessica Ruggles, corporate vice president of financial wellness at New York Life. “It wasn’t until much later that we did things like auto-enrollment and auto-contribution,” innovations that encourage higher rates of retirement saving. Schulz, of LendingTree, is 52: a quintessential Gen Xer. He got his first real job around 1995, in his early 20s. “I didn’t even really think of retirement, or anything like that, at that age,” he said. The typical Gen Xer began saving for retirement at age 30, half a decade later than millennials, according to the Transamerica Center. Today, the median Gen X household has $93,000 in retirement savings: Not nearly enough, in the eyes of many retirement planners. As a result, Transamerica found, most Gen Xers plan to keep working in retirement. Those figures come from the 2024 Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, which reached 5,730 workers. Other retirement surveys concur that Generation X faces a unique struggle in preparing for retirement. Only 60% of Gen Xers feel “on track” for retirement, the lowest share of any generation, according to the 2024 BlackRock Read on Retirement report. Three-fifths of Gen Xers worry they will outlive their retirement savings, BlackRock found. Only two-fifths of Gen Xers use a financial adviser, the lowest rate of any generation. Generation X also seems to have a credit card problem. More than one Gen X cardholder in four, or 27%, have maxed out their credit, Bankrate reported on Thursday. Gen-Xers are more likely than millennials or boomers to have exhausted their credit, the survey found. The finding is worrisome, retirement experts say, because consumers should be paying down their debt as they approach retirement, not charging it up. The Bankrate survey covered 3,576 adults. Meet the 'Beatlemania boomers.'They face a looming retirement crisis But here’s some good news, at least from a retirement perspective: Generation X is spending less on discretionary purchases in 2024, Bank of America reports. “Discretionary” is a category that covers non-essentials. And discretionary spending among Gen Xers is down 2% in the year ended August, according to internal Bank of America card data, the biggest drop of any generation. At the same time, Gen X is investing a larger share of its paycheck than other generations, according to a September report from Bank of America Institute. “Bottom line, they’re spending less and they’re investing more,” said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute. “It’s certainly a sign that Gen X is hopeful for the future. They think they will retire, and they think that in the future, those investments are going to pay off.”

Title: Des Cahill having the time of his life as Cuala’s footballers finally get their day in the sun

Cuala are in the Dublin football final for only the second time in their history, so what do you do? You get on to Des Cahill. And you ask Des Cahill who in Cuala should you be talking to about the club’s football story. You’d like, if possible, to hear from somebody who was around for all the bad times. A person who, while being delighted for the hurlers throughout their All-Ireland-winning success in the late-2010s, still flew the flag for the football side of the house. A Cuala big ball lifer. Des Cahill thinks about it for half an hour and replies by suggesting ... Des Cahill. “In terms of this team ... that’s probably me!” reads the WhatsApp reply. “I was with them since we won the Under-21 title 14 years ago until 2 years ago. Ironically the Under 21 win – against the odds – was against Crokes ... on my 50th birthday. A day of days!” And so here we are, a few afternoons later, walking down through the village of Glasthule with red and white flags hanging from every lamp-post. Keep going and you’ll arrive on to Main Street in Dalkey, where it’s impossible to go 10 yards without seeing some sign of the county final. This part of Dublin’s southside knows plenty about success in rugby and in hurling too. But a county football final? Not in this neighbourhood. “The joy of it is brilliant,” Cahill says. “We’re probably getting more joy out of it than most teams, I’d imagine. People say, ‘Oh Cuala, sure you won two All-Irelands’. Fantastic. And it really was, everyone was so happy for the hurlers. But for the likes of me now, this justifies years and years of sticking at it.” Cuala is a flipside club in Dublin. In most cases, being a dual club means one of two realities – you’re either stubbornly 50/50 or you’re a football club with a hurling section fighting its corner. In Cuala, it’s always been the other way around. Not outwardly, not officially – but everyone knows what’s what. Cahill tells a story about Vinny Holden, brother of Mick, son of Cuala founding father Tommy. Holden hurled for Dublin for 20 years and was a mainstay of the first Cuala teams to win senior Dublin titles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Spin the tape on and he and Cahill were in cahoots the day after the minor footballers won their first county championship in 2006. [ ‘We’re a long time on the road’: Michael Fitzsimons ready to tick senior club title off the list with CualaOpens in new window ] “Mick Fitzsimons was in that group,” Cahill remembers. “But you had Paul Schutte there, David Treacy, Oisin Gough – all those lads who went on to hurl for Dublin. We beat Vincent’s in the final and we were elated. For us owl’ lads, beating Vincent’s was huge. The young lads didn’t think that was a big deal but it was for us. “Anyway, we were all out after it and it went late and sure then we all had to ring home to explain where we were. And Vinnie rang his wife Marion and went, ‘Marion, you know the minor hurlers? They’re after winning the football championship!’ “They weren’t even called the minor footballers. So that sort of sums up Cuala for me, when people ask are we a hurling club or a football club.” Over the past four decades, Cahill has been the club’s best known member, give or take Con O’Callaghan. When Cuala reached their only Dublin football final away back in July 1988, he was out of the country on a summer-long work adventure that took in Euro 88, the Tour de France and the Seoul Olympics. He has waited 36 years for them to get back here. [ My Club: Des Cahill on Cuala Opens in new window ] For long stretches of Cuala’s footballing life, they have lived in the shadow of bigger concerns. That goes for their own club, where hurling has reigned. But it goes too for the schoolyard world of southside Dublin GAA, where Kilmacud Crokes have always been the biggest boys in the flashiest kits. “We would have resented Kilmacud years ago for being the big ogres and us being the small guys,” Cahill says. “We had a fellah, John O’Callaghan, who was a sub on the Dublin 1995 team that beat Tyrone to win the All-Ireland. He’s a great lad. “But Dublin said to him, ‘You can’t be playing intermediate, you need to be playing senior’. And he came to us and said, ‘Lads, do you mind if I go to Kilmacud?’ And we were going, ‘Eh, obviously!’ But we were only messing – no one minded because he was a great lad and you were happy to see him do well. But that’s who we were, basically.” As time went on and the GAA took more of a hold around the area, Cuala were never short of talent and certainly haven’t struggled for numbers. Eventually, that translated into an unprecedented level of hurling success. Five Dublin titles in six seasons between 2015 and 2020. Back-to-back Leinster and All-Ireland champions. A golden time. In a way, it all started in 2009. The backbone of those teams came from the side that won the under-21 hurling championship in Dublin 15 years ago. What got lost along the way though is the fact Cuala did the under-21 double in 2009 and that a huge chunk of them were on the football team as well. “That under-21 final was the start of this team,” Cahill says. “The final was just before Christmas and we beat Kilmacud against the odds. On the back of that, we had a lot of promise going forward. But the hurling took over. “I’m convinced, with the talent on that team, that we could have had great success in football. The lads on that team were really good underage footballers. Paul Schutte was at least two years as a Dublin minor footballer as a full-forward. Oisín Gough and the Treacys were good underage footballers. “But Anthony Daly took them in straight away and didn’t want them playing football. We won the Dublin intermediate championship one year and we were going into Leinster. But they were going in training with Dublin in November. And I’m friends with Daly and I was going, ‘Dalo, come on’. But he was trying to make his mark as well and he was just going, ‘Des, they have to put in the work now to be ready for next summer’. “So I lost out there. They went for Dublin, which was fair enough. We had seven in the Dublin squad at one stage. Then Matty [Kenny] came along as senior hurling manager in the club. And Matty was going, ‘This group has huge potential’. The first year or two, we didn’t do anything in the hurling. But he said, ‘You cannot be hurling only every second week. You’ve no chance’. “And he was a very good salesman to the lads. He said: ‘You have to hurl every week if you’re going to do anything in the championship’. And he did that – and he was right! I thought at the time that we could win the football and the hurling in Dublin but he was right and I was wrong. We wouldn’t have won an All-Ireland in hurling if the lads had all played football as well.” If it was anything, it was a first-world problem. Cuala were winning All-Irelands in hurling and the name of the club was going far and wide. The footballers chipped away with what they had – and when Con O’Callaghan came along, what they had was enough to keep them in or around the top ranks. Peadar Ó Cofaigh-Byrne arrived, big and broad and taking no nonsense from anyone. Plenty more as well. “We had James Power, who was a very good rugby player. He’s the oldest by a long way. Him and Mick Fitz and Luke Keating have been there all the way. Power is 37 or so now, he’s kind of a posh boy, you know? A good Blackrock boy. “He called the referee ‘Sir’ once! And everyone, including the referee, thought he was taking the piss. The opposition were laughing. But no one messes with him. He’s also the most physical player we have, he’s our toughest, hardest player as well. But yeah, he called the referee ‘Sir’ in a game and Jesus Christ the ref turned against us completely. “For the likes of him and Luke Keating, this is so great. Luke would have made those hurling teams but he chose to stay with the football. And I felt so guilty. For those lads to be in a county final now, it’s great. It’s just brilliant.” Cuala will travel across Dublin Bay in style, naturally. They will march through the village en masse on Sunday afternoon and climb aboard the DART they’ve hired for the occasion. It will leave Dalkey station and go directly to Killester – very pointedly not stopping in Blackrock or Seapoint or any of the other necklace of stations from which rogue Kilmacud Crokes might sneak aboard. Then they will march on Parnell Park, a football day of days finally upon them. And though they are underdogs and though they face a Crokes team going for four-in-a-row, they won’t be put off by the odds being stacked against them. Why would they? It’s all they know. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: GAA county final previews: Kilmacud-Crokes bidding for four-in-a-row in Dublin

Full Content:
Westmeath SFC final replay: St Loman’s v The Downs, TEG Cusack Park, 3.0 – There was nothing between them in the drawn match, a contest that went back and forth but Loman’s maybe have a little more room for improvement. Verdict: St Loman’s Leitrim SHC final: Carrick Hurling Club v Cluainín Iomáint, Drumshambo, 2.0. Armagh SFC final: Clann Éireann v Clan na Gael, Athletic Grounds, 4.15 – Clann Éireann beat champions Crossmaglen in the semi-final, as they did in the 2021 final when winning their most recent title. That recent pedigree makes them favourites with Armagh All-Ireland winners spread through the field from Barry McCambridge at the back to Conor Turbitt up front. Clan na Gael’s in-form Shane McPartlan and county super sub, Stefan Campbell will ensure it’s not easy but it’s hard to see an upset. Verdict: Clann Éireann Cavan SFC final: Crosserlough v Ramor United, Kingspan Breffini, 4.0 – Crosserlough have impressed on the way to the final, especially in the absence of injured star forward Paddy Lynch. An experienced Ramor will be formidable opponents and can spring a surprise. Verdict: Ramor United. Fermanagh SFC final: Enniskillen Gaels v Erne Gaels, Brewster Park, 2.0 – Former Donegal manager Declan Bonner is in charge of Erne Gaels’ quest for a first title in 43 years and they overcame champions and regular tormentors Derrygonnelly in the semi-final. Enniskillen, champions from two years ago, stand in the way. Verdict: Enniskillen Gaels Dublin SFC final: Cuala v Kilmacud Crokes, Parnell Park, 2.30 [Live, TG4] – Kilmacud, on the trail of a fourth straight title, are hot favourites against their southside neighbours, whose only previous final was in 1988. There have been slight signs of weariness in Crokes but in the past they have always perked up at the right time. Cuala may have the edge at centrefield with Peadar Ó Cofaigh Byrne and Cillian Dunne, brother of county women’s star Jennifer, in fine form. The Dalkey side are 100 per cent for the championship to date – Crokes drew along the way – and Con O’Callaghan has been a consistent menace. What may decide the outcome is the polished Kilmacud defence, which can restrict their opponents’ high-scoring attack and leave an attainable target for Paul Mannion and company at the other end. Verdict: Kilmacud Crokes London SFC final: St Kiernan’s v North London Shamrocks, Ruislip, 2.30. Louth SFC final: Naomh Mairtín v St Mary’s, Haggardstown, 3.30 – St Mary’s are on three-in-a-row and face the team they beat in last year’s final. Despite some indifferent form along the way, they can keep the title in Ardee. Verdict: St Mary’s Longford SFC final replay: Abbeylara v Colmcille, Glennon Brothers Pearse Park, 4.0 – Abbeylara may have missed their chance last week against the experienced former champions. Verdict: Colmcille Mayo SFC final: Ballina Stephenites v Knockmore – Postponed due to the Met Éireann status orange wind warning that has been issued for Mayo. Game will now be played next Saturday, October 26th. Meath SFC final: Dunshaughlin v Wolfe Tones, Páirc Tailteann, 3.0 – A clash between the experience of Wolfe Tones and a rising Dunshaughlin, just a couple of seasons out of intermediate. Managed by Richie Kealy and coached by former Dublin All-Ireland winner Paul Curran, who has returned to his Dunshaughlin roots, the club his father Noel played for when winning an All-Ireland with Meath in 1967. Verdict: Dunshaughlin Roscommon SFC final: Pádraig Pearses v Roscommon Gaels, Dr Hyde Park, 2.0 – Pearses caused a big shock when eliminating St Brigid’s, the Connacht champions, who were unlucky not to win last season’s All-Ireland. Former provincial winners themselves, they are unlikely to let it slip against an emerging but still callow Gaels team. Verdict: Pádraig Pearses Tipperary SFC final: Clonmel Commercials v Loughmore-Castleiney, Semple Stadium, 4.0 – The great dual story of Loughmore continues and both their form in walloping the fancied Moyle Rovers and their momentum as hurling champions gives them a great chance against the formidable Commercials, who are on a three-in-a-row. Verdict: Loughmore-Castleiney Tyrone SFC final: Errigal Ciarán v Trillick, Healy Park, 4.0 – Trillick came out winners in this same fixture a year ago after a thrilling final in which they deposed the then champions. There’s not much in it again but spurred by last year’s reverse, Errigal Ciarán can settle accounts with the champions. Verdict: Errigal Ciarán Waterford SFC final: Ballinacourty v Rathgormack, Fraher Field Dungarvan, 3.0 – Rathgormack annihilated The Nire in the semi-final and are well fancied not to relent in the final against Ballinacourty who will be sterner opponents after a narrow win over Gaultier. Verdict: Rathgormack Wicklow SFC final: Baltinglass v Tinahely, Aughrim, 2.0 – Precedent is against Tinahely, who lost their more recent final to this weekend’s opponents four years ago and were also beaten when the teams met earlier in this season’s championship. Verdict: Baltinglass Antrim SHC final: Dunloy v Ruairi Óg Cushendall, Ballycastle, 2.0 – Conal Cunning’s injury is a major blow for Dunloy, who had an impressive semi-final win over Loughgiel and were on course to reclaim the Antrim title. It’s more complicated now. Verdict: Cushendall Clare SHC final: Sixmilebridge v Feakle – Postponed due to the Met Éireann status orange wind warning that was issued for Clare on Saturday. Game provisionally scheduled for bank holiday Monday, October 28th. Cork SHC final: Imokilly v Sarsfields, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, TG4, 4.15 – A tight, tight extra-time win for Sarsfields was the outcome when the teams met in last year’s semi-final, which should ostensibly give a motivational edge to Imokilly against the champions who again had a tough semi-final this time against Midleton and did well to survive. That may have renewed them for the final after an undemanding earlier season whereas Imokilly were comfortable winners against Blackrock. Séamus Harnedy has maintained his strong Cork form for the challengers as has Ciarán Joyce. Verdict: Imokilly Derry SHC final: Slaughtneil v Banagher, Owenbeg, 4.0 – Banagher approach with hopes high but it’s hard to argue with a team looking for a 12th successive title. Verdict: Slaughtneil Down SHC final: Ballygalget v St Patrick’s, Páirc Esler, 4.0. Offaly SHC final: Ballinamere v Kilcormac-Kiloughey, Glenisk O’Connor Park, 3.45 – Contrasting finalists, as Ballinamere have reached this stage for the first time in more than 100 years whereas their opponents have won five titles in the past 12 years. Defending champions Kilcormac have been in exceptional form this season and even though Ballinamere are clearly on the rise, the breakthrough may have to wait. Verdict: Kilcormac-Killoughey Sligo SHC final: Easkey v Naomh Eoin, Markievicz Park, 2.0 Seán Moran is GAA Correspondent of The Irish Times Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘A period piece, a has-been, totally unknown to this generation’: Rediscovering WM Letts

With the surname Letts, it’s not surprising that diaries, letters and memoir form a major part of the literary estate of WM Letts. What is surprising is that the life story and works of this poet, war poet, dramatist, novelist, essayist and children’s writer have been almost forgotten, despite the recent interest in neglected female authors. Winifred Mabel Letts (1882-1972) was the granddaughter of Thomas Letts of Letts Diaries, and of Alexander James Ferrier of Ferrier Pollock & Co, a wholesale textile and haberdashery company whose headquarters were at Powerscourt Town House, off Grafton Street. Her father was Rev Ernest Letts, rector of Newton Heath in Manchester, who also used to officiate as summer chaplain at Holy Trinity Church on the Herberts’ Muckross Estate in Kerry. Her mother was Mary Isabel Ferrier, of Knockmaroon, just outside the gates of the Phoenix Park. It was to Knockmaroon – “to Paradise” – that the family came on holidays each year, to escape from their “smoke-blackened and rather grim” Lancashire parish. At the age of 16, Letts moved from a boarding school in the English midlands to Alexandra College in Dublin, where she studied English language and literature, French language and literature, history, geography and drawing. Following the death of her father in 1904, the family moved from Newton Heath to Blackrock, Co Dublin. The open spaces of Ireland and the open nature of Irish people seem to have released her creative spirit and, for the next 60 years, newspapers, periodicals, publishers and broadcasters regularly featured Letts’s writings – poems, short stories, essays, children’s books, plays, reviews and, in the case of The Irish Times, her letters to the editor. Letts’s first visit to the Abbey Theatre – “a daring move” as the Abbey was regarded suspiciously by her own unionist Protestant circle – was to see Synge’s Riders to the Sea in January 1907. It inspired her to write and submit a play of her own, The Eyes of the Blind, which was accepted and first performed on Easter Monday, along with Yeats’ Deirdre and Lady Gregory’s Spreading the News and The Rising of the Moon. In October 1909, her play, The Challenge, was performed, and thus Letts, as well as being only the second female playwright to have a play performed in the Abbey, is one of the few women – to date – to have had more than one play performed there. Other plays and sketches were broadcast on radio and performed by amateur groups, and a three-act documentary play, Hamilton and Jones, was staged in the Gate Theatre in July 1941. [ What do Irish writers read? Donal Ryan, Mark Tighe, Nuala O’Connor, Claire Hennessy and more give recommendationsOpens in new window ] Letts said, when interviewed in 1969 by Maeve Binchy for The Irish Times’s Women First series, that she never heard anything “memorable or musical” in drawingroom conversation and that all her ideas came “from the back door”, from listening to the talk of people “who came to sell things or to deliver vegetables”. A conversation with a blackberry seller from Glencullen led to the poem, Thim that Thravels on their Feet, which was published in the Spectator in 1910. Letts was then asked to write a cycle of poems which CV Stanford could set to music for Harry Plunket Greene to sing. Many of her best-known poems, including A Soft Day, Tim, An Irish Terrier, and The Bold Unbiddable Child, were published in her first collection of poetry, Songs from Leinster (1913). The two Stanford cycles, A Fire of Turf and A Sheaf of Songs from Leinster, were taken from this collection, and were performed as recently as March 2024 in the National Concert Hall as part of the Stanford Centenary Series. A second and third collection of lyrical poetry followed in 1926 and 1947. Letts was asked to write a cycle of poems which CV Stanford could set to music for Harry Plunket Greene to sing Letts’s work during the first World War as a nursing voluntary aid detachment in Manchester, followed by her training in Baggot Street Hospital as a masseuse (nowadays called a physiotherapist), resulted in her groundbreaking war poetry, published prior to the collections of Sassoon, Owen and Ledwidge. Her early war poems celebrated the young men going off to war, even though they leave their heartbroken families behind. But as the war progressed, Letts exposed the physical trauma, and the barely acknowledged problems of mental trauma, in poems such as To a Soldier in Hospital and What Reward? Her empathy with, and sympathy for, the young soldier who “could not face the German guns” in her poem, The Deserter, makes this one of the most moving of all war poems. The collections, Hallow-e’en and Poems of the War and The Spires of Oxford and Other Poems, were published in 1916 and 1917. As well as writing poetry and drama, essays and short stories, Letts wrote six children’s books (five of which were serialised and broadcast on radio), three books on religious themes, a memoir (Knockmaroon) and seven novels directed at an audience of young women experiencing the freedom brought about by education and employment opportunities. Her verses were used by Elizabeth C Yeats in her Cuala Press prints and cards. A copy of the Cuala Press print St Brigid, with verse by Letts, and illustrated by her stepdaughter, Kathleen Verschoyle, now hangs in Government Buildings. Letts continued her professional work as a masseuse up to the time of her marriage in 1926 to William HF Verschoyle, a widower 23 years older than her, who had lost two of his three sons in the first World War. Letts initially found it difficult to adapt to living in town, at 19 Fitzwilliam Square, but she loved her time on the Verschoyle farmlands in Kilberry, Co Kildare. She relished the company of her step-grandson, her great-nieces, her many godchildren, and the children of those who worked for them. Life was busy with her involvement in the Women Writers’ Club, PEN, Wild Flower Society, and many charities, including the Dublin Auxiliary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (DSPCA), to whom she donated royalties and poems, when it was in financial difficulties. [ Sam Thompson: ‘I really don’t think there is a distinction to be made between writing for adults and writing for children’Opens in new window ] After the death of her husband, Letts moved to Kent in 1947 to live with her sisters. She returned permanently to Ireland in 1953, and bought the charming Beech Cottage on Ballinclea Road, Killiney. Fifty years after her death in 1972, President Michael D Higgins attended a ceremony in Rathcoole Church of Ireland marking the addition of her name to the Verschoyle headstone. In a 1957 interview in The Irish Times, Letts described herself as “a period piece, a has-been, totally unknown to this generation”. Two generations later, Letts is, at last, being recognised and remembered – as a groundbreaking poet, an innovative dramatist, an engaging novelist and a talented children’s author. Sing in the Quiet Places of my Heart, a biography of Letts by Bairbre O’Hogan, is published by South Dublin Libraries.

Title: Gold tops $2,700 for first time to extend record-breaking run
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/gold-price-2700-first-time-record-rally-mideast-us-election/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T22:23:19Z
Full Content:
Gold topped $2,700 an ounce for the first time as concerns over escalating conflicts in the Middle East and a tight US election race prompt investors to flock to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 1% to $2,720.17 an ounce, beating the all-time high set in the previous session. The bullish sentiment spilled over to the wider precious metals complex, with silver jumping as much as 5.5% to the highest since 2012. BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Silver Trust, the largest exchange-traded product tracking the metal, saw a large increase of call options as investors bet on higher prices. Markets are focused on increasingly fraught geopolitical developments after Israel said it killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Palestinian group’s attack on southern Israel that triggered a yearlong war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would keep fighting until all the hostages captured by Hamas last year are free, even as US President Joe Biden said it was time for the war to end. Investors typically seek safety in gold in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Investors were also repositioning portfolios ahead of the US election on Nov. 5. “Traditional polls and decentralized betting polls have diverged significantly, even as we get closer to elections,” said Christopher Wong, FX strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Trump hedges — long gold — may still gather traction given the fluidity of election developments and geopolitical uncertainties.” Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%, snapping a four-day rally. A weaker greenback makes bullion cheaper for many buyers, as it is priced in the US currency. Gold is about 2.4% higher for the week, with haven demand outweighing other macro headwinds that would normally weigh on the precious metal after US reports on Thursday diminished bets on the scale of Federal Reserve easing. Bullion is one of 2024’s strongest performing commodities, with gains of more than 30% so far this year. Rate-cut optimism fueled the most recent gains as the Fed kicked off its easing cycle last month. Robust central bank buying has also been a long-standing pillar of support for gold prices. Read More: Gold Investors See Gains in Rate-Cut Era From ETFs, Haven Buying Western investors have also helped drive prices higher, after largely remaining on the sidelines in the first half of the year as Asian demand surged. The US central bank’s pivot to looser monetary policy has bolstered the appeal of exchange-traded funds backed by bullion, with holdings on course for a fifth monthly expansion in October — the longest run of inflows since 2020. For many in the industry, the outlook from here is even more bullish. Traders, refiners and miners who attended the London Bullion Market Association’s annual gathering this week saw prices rising to about $2,917 an ounce by late October 2025, according to the average forecast from a survey of delegates. Silver will gain more than 40% in the coming year to reach $45 an ounce, according to the survey. Spot gold was trading at $2,718.72 an ounce as of 2:36 p.m. in New York.

Title: US SEC gives green light for options listing for spot bitcoin ETFs to NYSE

(Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to 11 exchange-traded funds to list and trade options tied to spot bitcoin prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a regulatory filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are among funds that received the approval on Friday. The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

Title: BlackRock eyes crypto derivatives market with BUIDL as collateral

The move could boost significantly the nearly $550 million market cap presented by BUIDL, the largest tokenized US treasuries fund. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is reportedly in discussions with several centralized exchanges to allow its BUIDL fund to be used as collateral for derivatives trades As reported by Bloomberg on Oct. 18, people familiar with the matter shared that the move includes exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit. This move is part of a broader push by Wall Street firms to deepen their involvement in the digital asset markets. BlackRock’s BUIDL token requires a minimum investment of $5 million and is specifically designed for qualified institutional investors. FalconX and Hidden Road, two major crypto prime brokers, already permit their hedge fund clients to use BUIDL as collateral, while custodian Komainu recently announced its clients would be able to trade via Hidden Road using the token as collateral. Direct acceptance of BUIDL on platforms like Binance and Deribit would significantly increase its market reach. The crypto derivatives market moved nearly $3.5 trillion in September, which is almost four times larger than the spot market, according to data from Coinglass and The Block. While BlackRock has yet to comment on the initiative, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers acknowledged that the exchange is considering various tokens, including BUIDL. However, Strijers stressed the need for regulatory approvals and a deeper understanding of the token’s technical aspects before moving forward. The report of the world’s largest asset manager moving deeper into crypto coincides with another report about a crypto-native company delving into traditional finance. Tether Limited, the issuer of the Tether USD (USDT) stablecoin, is reportedly considering offering lending to commodities trading companies. The move is a possible alternative the crypto firm found to leverage its $5.2 billion profit registered in the first half. Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are already considering using BUIDL tokenized shares in financial instruments. On Aug. 26, leading money market platform Aave proposed a new GHO Stability Module (GSM) based on BlackRock’s tokenized fund. GSM is a mechanism created by Aave to help maintain the peg of its ecosystem’s stablecoin, GHO. When users swap USD Coin (USDC) for GHO, the novel module would allow the exchange of USDC for BUIDL. According to the proposal, this would help GHO’s stability while providing value accrual to users through BlackRock’s offered yield. Moreover, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs revealed a new stablecoin fully backed by BUIDL on Sept. 26. The UStb would offer an alternative to Ethena’s USDe, appealing to users with a more conservative appetite for risk.

Cohen, who heads up the asset manager's exchange-traded funds and index investments as chief investment officer, told CNBC that BlackRock now sees the demand was for a better way to access bitcoin. "It was for the ETF wrapper," she told CNBC on stage at the Permissionless Conference in Utah. The total market cap of all eleven spot bitcoin ETFs now tops $63 billion, with total flows of nearly $20 billion. In the last five trading days alone, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of more than $2.1 billion, with BlackRock accounting for half of those sales. The spike in trading volume comes as bitcoin hit its highest level since July this week, trading above $68,300. Bitcoin ended the third quarter up around 140% from the same quarter a year ago, outpacing the S&P 500, as these spot token funds and the crypto market cap move higher in lock-step. Crypto-aligned stock Coinbase closed up about 24% this week, its best week since February. Cohen told CNBC that part of the strategy for attracting customers to its funds was teaching crypto investors about the benefits of exchange-traded products (ETPs). 13F filings, which offer quarterly reads on equity positions taken by large investors, show that 80% of the buyers of these new spot bitcoin products in the U.S. are direct investors. Of the 80% of direct investors, Cohen told CNBC that 75% had never before owned an iShare, one of the best-known and largest ETF providers on the planet. "So we went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically," said Cohen. "As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper." Before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission green-lit spot bitcoin funds in January, investors had a few ways to buy and custody cryptocurrencies. A centralized exchange like Coinbase was among the most user-friendly options for U.S investors. But the blockbuster debut of bitcoin ETPs has laid bare to Cohen and others across Wall Street, that crypto exchanges weren't giving digital asset investors everything they needed. It helps that the U.S. is a huge market for digital assets. New data from Chainalysis shows that North America remains the biggest crypto market globally, accounting for nearly 23% of all crypto trading volume. The blockchain analytics platform estimates that between July 2023 and July 2024, there was $1.3 trillion in on-chain value received. Venture firm a16z found in its recently released State of Crypto report that more than 40 million Americans hold crypto. So far, adoption has mostly been through wealth management clients asking advisors to add new spot crypto products to their portfolio. In August, Morgan Stanley was the first big bank to allow its 15,000 financial advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity to clients with a net worth over $1.5 million. Other firms are still performing in-house due diligence before allowing their armies of FAs to start actively pitching the funds. "Wealth manager allocators have not been allocating," VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC in Utah. "I mean, they're barely even warming up." Van Eck drew parallels to the European market, where the company has 12 token-based products trading in Europe. "It's exactly what we see in Europe," he said. "Very few private banks have really approved investment in bitcoin or ethereum or anything else in a major way." Van Eck said his company has about $2 billion in its European crypto ETPs, and that a lot of the volume is from individual investors. Wall Street needs rules from lawmakers on Capitol Hill before it gets more comfortable with crypto. Cohen thinks that in a lot of ways, ETFs and blockchain technology are solving for similar things. "ETFs have been a decentralizing force in TradFi markets that have brought a lot more access and transparency, and importantly, really accelerated in growth during the post crisis 2008, 2009 period," said Cohen, referring to traditional finance markets. "I find it incredibly meaningful to look at the fact that the bitcoin whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008, and then you have the G20 leaders from around the world meeting to discuss the aftermath of the financial crisis and how do you create more transparency through public reporting," Cohen continued. BlackRock took on less risk by using counterparty clearing and multilateral trading. In TradFi markets, those moves created huge tailwinds for ETFs. "Then at the same time, DeFi is becoming a reality over the intervening 15 years," she said. "Was this a win for Bitcoin? Was this a win for ETPs? To me, the answer is: It's a win for investors, to the extent we can effectively marry these ecosystems which are solving for the same goals." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Clontarf, the only unbeaten side in Division 1A of the Energia AIL, host second-placed Terenure in a top flight summit meeting which is also a repeat of the final both two and three seasons ago. The new classico, as it were. After wins over the two promoted sides and UCD, this is ‘Tarf’s toughest test so far. Andy Wood makes only once change, restoring loose-head prop Alex Usanov (one of many Emerging Ireland and academy talents to varnish today’s fourth round). Sean Skehan makes four changes to the Terenure side which beat Lansdowne a fortnight ago, with 19-year-old Austrian outhalf Casper Gabriel given his first AIL start alongside Conor McKeon. Max Russell returns at hooker and captain Luke Clohessy makes his first start of the season. In another clash between two of ‘the big four’, Lansdowne host champions Cork Con. The Emerging Ireland/Leinster academy duo of Cormac Foley and Charlie Tector are Lansdowne’s half-backs, while Greg McGrath, Juan Beukes and Donough Lawlor are added to the pack. Con, who completed a one-score double here last March thanks to a Matthew Bowen hat-trick, welcome back Emerging Ireland/Munster academy hooker Danny Sheahan alongside his cousin Jacob on the bench. Daniel Hurley and Louis Kahn return as does former captain and club stalwart Aidan Moynihan on the bench. UCD welcome back Emerging Ireland lock Conor O’Tighearnaigh along with fellow Leinster Academy players, Ruben Moloney, Ben Brownlee, Rory McGuire, and Alan Spicer in a stacked pack for their bottom two clash at City Of Armagh. Nenagh Ormond host Old Belvedere in a 1B summit meeting while the quartet of 2A pacesetters with a maximum 15 points are all at home.

Title: BlackRock to integrate BUIDL fund as collateral for Binance, OKX, and Deribit

Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:15:13Z

Share this article BlackRock is advancing into the crypto derivatives market by integrating its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, as collateral for crypto trades, according to a report by Bloomberg. The asset management giant is in discussions with major crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Deribit, aiming to expand BUIDL’s use in derivatives. Already accepted by prime brokers FalconX and Hidden Road, BUIDL’s adoption could challenge dominant stablecoins like USDT and USDC in collateral markets. With a minimum investment of $5 million, BlackRock’s BUIDL token is designed for institutional investors. By having it accepted as collateral, BlackRock aims to provide a highly liquid and secure alternative for derivatives traders. This could shake up the current dominance of USDT, which holds a market value of $120 billion and is the most commonly used collateral in crypto derivatives. BlackRock launched its BUIDL token in March 2024 as part of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The token is a blockchain-based representation of a traditional money-market fund that invests in assets like US Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. BUIDL distinguishes itself from other stablecoins by offering interest to holders, making it an attractive option for institutional investors seeking both yield and security. If exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Deribit integrate BUIDL, the token could become a standard for institutional collateral, providing a regulated, yield-bearing alternative to existing stablecoins. In addition to its focus on BUIDL, BlackRock has been actively leading the Bitcoin ETF space. Since the start of October alone, BlackRock has acquired over $2.2 billion worth of Bitcoin, accounting for 8% of their total Bitcoin holdings. BlackRock’s leadership in acquiring Bitcoin spot ETFs is set to expand their influence across both spot and derivatives markets. The integration of BUIDL as collateral for derivatives trades could complement their Bitcoin strategy, allowing for a diversified presence across crypto markets.

Title: ‘I really enjoy the journey of it all’: Lacken lad Caelan Doris would make ideal Lions king
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/18/i-really-enjoy-the-journey-of-it-all-lacken-lad-caelan-doris-would-make-ideal-lions-king/

It will be another six months before Andy Farrell finally has to choose his British & Irish Lions captain for the 2025 expedition to Australia. Plenty of time for the landscape to change and, theoretically, for one or two surprise contenders to emerge from the shrubbery. Until, that is, you sit down with the staggeringly impressive Caelan Doris and realise there is little need for Farrell to look anywhere else. A bold prediction? Hardly. It is not rocket science that a world-class player with the universal respect of his peers, a university degree in psychology and a warm smile might just fit the bill. Ireland have produced some illustrious Lions captains in the pro era, from Brian O’Driscoll to Paul O’Connell and Peter O’Mahony, and another top-drawer candidate lurks quietly in the wings. Because whether or not he is confirmed, as most anticipate, on Wednesday as Ireland’s skipper for the upcoming November Tests, the 26-year-old Leinster back-rower is every coach’s dream. Even on a damp Tuesday morning he is already eyeing the next big challenge, batteries recharged and eyes gleaming after last Saturday’s win over Munster in front of 80,468 spectators at Croke Park. “You just kind of get into the zone. I don’t think I’m crazy aggressive; I’d say I’m relatively consistent on and off the pitch. But of course you’re competitive and want to play on the edge and win.” Alongside the footwork, physicality and footballing nous that make him such an effective number eight, however, Doris is no ordinary jock. The son of two psychoanalysts – his maternal grandfather Michael Sweetman was a prominent industrialist and political figure who tragically died in the Staines air crash in 1972 – he might have pursued a very different career. Or maybe not, given what he found when he returned to his native Co Mayo this summer. “I was back home in June, flicking through some old stuff, and found a book I’d made when I was making my Holy Communion at the age of 10 or 11. It had a page for future ambitions and where I wanted to live. On it was written, ‘I want to be a rugby or a football player’. That was kind of cool because I don’t remember that being something I was going after.” The follow-up entry – “I want to have a house in Mayo, London and New York” – also prompted some amusement. “I’ll be a while playing rugby if I want to do that.” To understand the real Doris, even so, you need to understand Lacken, where he grew up. The post office and the shop were sad casualties of Covid but the area remains close to his heart. “It’s beautiful. On a good day it’s hard to beat. My parents are still based there and I get back when I can. “It’s very rural ... I think there’s about 500 people in the parish. It’s about 10 minutes to the closest village and 20 minutes to the closest town. At my primary school, which was walking distance from where I grew up, there were 30 to 35 pupils in the whole school across eight years. In my year, I only had one other classmate.” Fortunately he and his solitary companion, David, became good friends but the 12-year-old Doris subsequently leapt at the chance to board at Blackrock College. Perhaps his genes would have propelled him into the national squad anyway but he thinks otherwise. “I’m more of a nurture over nature guy. Of course there’s a genetic element of it but I’d have had a rugby ball or a Gaelic football in hand from a very early age. We had a pretty big garden and lived by a school with a pitch so there was always something going on. Then you go to Blackrock, which is a massive rugby school. I loved it from the start.” He has been on a steep upward trajectory ever since. The 6ft 4in forward captained Ireland under-20s in 2018, made his Leinster debut in the same year and won the first of his 44 senior Ireland caps in 2020 under the captaincy of Johnny Sexton, whom he’d grown up admiring from afar. “It was strange initially. There was a bit of impostor syndrome: ‘What the hell am I doing in the same dressingroom as this guy?’” [ How to overcome impostor syndrome: ‘It affects high achievers who feel unworthy’Opens in new window ] Now, suddenly, Sexton has retired and Doris, who was in Cardiff this week to promote this year’s Investec Champions Cup, is fast becoming a similar talisman for Leinster and Ireland. He led the national side for the first time against Italy in February and was appointed Leinster’s captain last month. The mental side of the game – “It’s definitely an area I’m interested in ….” – fascinates him, as does the potential for captaincy to enhance his growth as a player and a person. “I want to get the best out of myself from a playing and a human perspective. If there’s extra responsibility ... it allows you to increase your capacity.” This includes his inner self. “Anything from being more open with friends and family or getting things off my chest or sharing something with someone. I do weekly therapy sessions and mindfulness to fill up the tank.” Sea swimming and saunas are other regular pastimes. “I’ve also started doing a bit of hot yoga recently, which I’ve enjoyed. It all just gives you a bit of balance and calm.” He will need plenty of both if a high-profile Lions role does come. As a kid, Doris remembers accompanying his father, Chris, to a local village pub at breakfast time to cheer on the Lions in 2005 and 2009 and Australia 2025 has long been on his bucket list. “It’s a pretty special thing isn’t it? It’s definitely a goal. There’s a lot of rugby to be played before then for Leinster and Ireland. But, yeah, I would absolutely love to be on the tour.” Before that, of course, comes next month’s looming reunion with the All Blacks, the first meeting of the sides since last year’s fateful World Cup quarter-final. That anniversary fell this week but Doris is more focused on embracing the next phase of his career. “Of course there are hard days, but there are so many good ones as well,” he said. “I really enjoy the journey of it all: the craic with the lads, the friendships, the travel, the opportunities. I’m trying to soak it all in.” The country boy from Lacken would make a cracking Lion king. – Guardian © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Will This Bull Market Ever End? – September Dividend Income Report
URL: https://thedividendguyblog.com/will-this-bull-market-ever-end/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T14:41:34Z
Full Content:
The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / October 18, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. Last month, I covered why BCE is dead to me. This time, let’s also look at our never-ending bull market and what could happen next. Let’s start with the numbers as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – October 2024): 160.33% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 84 months): 14.65% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 14.53% (total return 158.50%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 10.42% (total return 100.10%) It seems that each time I review my portfolio, I cross a new all-time high. On one side, I’m glad I’m always 100% invested as I fully benefit from the bull markets. On the other hand, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow when I look at the current state of the market. This will not change my strategy, but I seriously think we are due for a market correction. Having said that, I would still invest all my money in the stock market if I had received my pension account last summer instead of doing it seven years ago. In the end, it doesn’t matter what I think will happen in the market in the next 12 months, as time in the market is more important than timing the market. Now, the S&P 500 is up by more than 20% since the beginning of the year, and the TSX is not far behind at +16% (including dividends). When investors ask if it’s time to invest in the stock market because interest rates are finally going down this year, I answer that the market started banking this information 12 months ago. This is what I was telling you in this monthly report back in November 2023. On the U.S. side, I was surprised that the utility sector surged more than all the others (+31.56% so far this year). The communication sector, led by tech giants Alphabet and Meta, is second, while the financial industry closes the top 3 best-performing sectors using SPDR spiders ETFs. Of course, this is not perfect, as ETFs can play around with stock allocation for each sector, but it gives a good idea of what is going on. You won’t be surprised to find the consumer discretionary sector last, offering a return of about half of the S&P 500 (around 10%). It seems it’s the only sector warning us that a recession could happen as many companies struggle to report sales and profit growth, claiming customers are stuck with tight budgets. When I look at the BMO ETFs tracking a mix of Canadian and U.S. stocks, I come to a similar conclusion about the consumer discretionary sector. It’s a tough ride if you are exposed to this sector. Still, everything is in positive territory with a strong rebound from the energy sector leading the pack with communications (BMO includes Alphabet and Meta in their ETF too). Despite concerns about the economy, Canadian Banks are doing quite well! Even ScotiaBank is performing well in 2024! If you are looking for “undervalued” stocks, the best sectors seem to be consumer discretionary and REITs (potentially utilities in Canada, too). Those sectors have taken a good hit since the rise in interest rates, and the recovery is not complete for many companies. Investing during all-time highs is always tricky as we fear a market crash. However, focusing on quality (read strong financial fundamentals) will always be a winning strategy. And let’s be honest, it’s a lot easier to select quality companies than predict where the market may be in 6 months! Should you want to add some stocks to your portfolio, I have shared my Top Underrated Dividend Growers on my YouTube channel. It includes my analysis of LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT), one of my holdings. Watch it below: Slowly but surely, the portfolio is taking shape with 11 companies spread across 7 sectors. My goal is to build a portfolio generating 4-5% in yield across 15 positions. I will continue to add new stocks monthly until I reach that goal. My current yield is 4.47%. I used my $500 contribution to buy more Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO). The stock has dropped about 20% from its peak value due to the weakness in oil prices. That’s a good time to buy more of what always works! I’ve covered CNQ’s recent drop in this podcast episode: I will likely sell my shares of CWB in the coming months since the play worked out perfectly, and I can move my money into another stock and it will help reduce my exposure to the financial sector. Here’s my SM portfolio as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): Let’s look at my CDN portfolio. Numbers are as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$2,777.13 (+2.54%) since September’s income report. We are at the end of a quarter and I’ll start reviewing U.S. companies’ earnings in my next portfolio update. Here’s my US portfolio now. Numbers are as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$5,894.06 (+4.89%) since September’s income report. Each quarter we run an exclusive report for Dividend Stocks Rock (DSR) members who subscribe to our very special additional service called DSR PRO. The PRO report includes a summary of each company’s earnings report for the period. We have been doing this for an entire year now and I wanted to share my own DSR PRO report for this portfolio. You can download the full PDF showing all the information about all my holdings. Results have been updated as of October 4th, 2024. Download my portfolio Q3 2024 report. It’s great to see a steady dividend increase over the past few months. I’ve performed a few transactions over the past 18 months such as selling Enbridge and Magna International, and my portfolio still pays more dividends now than ever. It’s great that most of my holdings have increased their dividends in the mid to high single-digits! It’s a great sign that my portfolio is healthy. Dividend growth (over the past 12 months): Canadian Holding payouts: $393.46 CAD. U.S. Holding payouts: $228.10 USD. Total payouts: $702.22 CAD. *I used a USD/CAD conversion rate of 1.3536 Since I started this portfolio in September 2017, I have received a total of $27,912.93 CAD in dividends. Keep in mind that this is a “pure dividend growth portfolio,” as no capital can be added to this account other than retained and/or reinvested dividends. Therefore, all dividend growth is coming from the stocks and not from any additional capital being added to the account. You may have noticed that I hold over $1,000 in cash across my US and Canadian accounts. This liquidity will soon be used to increase my position in Toromont Industries (TIH.TO) since it’s my smallest holding. I haven’t moved yet because I’ve been busy with other stuff! I don’t expect to make any other trades by the end of the year unless one of my top holdings breaks the 10% barrier of all my portfolios (hello, Apple!). Cheers, Mike.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs break $20 billion in inflows as BTC aims ATH

BTC ETFs achieve record inflows in months, a feat that took Gold ETFs years to achieve. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to shatter records and defy expectations. In a remarkable development, cumulative total net inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded the $20 billion mark for the first time since its launch in January. This record level was achieved following a massive influx of $1.5 billion in just four days. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted the significance of this milestone on X (formerly Twitter). He stated, “The most imp number, most difficult metric to grow in ETF world.” He further compared it to gold ETFs, noting that: “It took gold ETFs about 5yrs to reach same number.” It is worth noting that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been a major contributor to these inflows. Data reported by SoSo Value revealed that on the 17th of October, BTC Spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $470 million. Out of which, IBIT led the way with an impressive $309 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ETF ARKB followed with a net inflow of $100 million. Source: SoSo Value As a result of these inflows, the total assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $64 billion. On the 16th of October, IBIT experienced a substantial net inflow of $393.4 million, marking its largest inflow since July. At press time, BlackRock’s net assets stood at over $25 billion. The product accounted for 1.95% of the entire Bitcoin market share of $1.3 trillion. The surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs wasn’t the only bright spot this week. The cryptocurrency market has brought the long-awaited ‘Uptober’ rally to life. After briefly dipping to around $58,000 on the 10th of October, BTC skyrocketed to a high of over $68,000 in just six days. Over the past week, it rallied by double digits, gaining approximately 12%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,786, just 8% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of over $73,000. Consequently, optimism has been growing among traders, with many speculating that this bull cycle could propel Bitcoin to new highs. The combination of bullish sentiment and a potential supply shock has sparked renewed enthusiasm and interest in the asset, suggesting the rally may be far from over. While the king coin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market value, it has also managed to secure its spot among the top monetary assets. According to CompaniesMarketCap, Bitcoin now ranks as the 10th largest monetary asset globally. This achievement highlights Bitcoin’s growing influence not just in digital assets, but also in global financial markets.

Title: ‘$500 Billion In Three Weeks’—Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk Issues ‘Crazy’ Fed ‘Bankruptcy’ Warning After Sparking Bitcoin Price Panic

The bitcoin price, which soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin in recent weeks thanks to BlackRock and China, has stalled after Tesla's $750 million worth of bitcoin moved to new addresses following two years of dormancy, sparking speculation Tesla may have sold off its remaining bitcoin. Now, as billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller issues a serious Federal Reserve warning, Elon Musk has repeated a warning that the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has repeatedly warned the U.S. is headed for "bankruptcy"—while the ... [+] bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin. "Excess government spending is driving America to bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter. Musk's post quoted an anonymous finance account that had said "$500 billion was added to the national debt in just the last 3 weeks," adding: "The government is out of control." Meanwhile, speaking during a town hall meeting in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Musk warned inflation could again spiral out of control as a result of "crazy" government spending. "The Federal government is spending America into bankruptcy ... and that's what really leads to inflation ... when the government spends more than it brings in," Musk said, calling it a "pernicious" tax. "We have to radically reduce the amount of government spending so we don't rack up a government debt that's impossible to repay and we don't drive the country to bankruptcy," Musk said. 10/20 update: Elon Musk has continued to warn that U.S. spending is spiraling out of control, posting to X that "this needs to stop." "The U.S. Treasury—your tax dollars—are being wasted at a staggering rate," Musk posted, quoting a post by a political action committee (PAC) founded by Musk that claimed "half a trillion dollars has been added to the National Debt in the in the past three weeks." "Wasteful spending is out of control in this country," the America PAC posted, adding "a Department of Government Efficiency is desperately needed." Musk has agreed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that has been suggested by former U.S. president and Republican candidate Donald Trump, calling it Doge—a reference to the meme that's also the basis of the dogecoin cryptocurrency. The dogecoin cryptocurrency, a tongue-in-cheek rival to bitcoin that's been semi-adopted by Musk over recent years, has seen its price soar 25% this last week on the back of Musk's Doge department comments—which caused billionaire Mark Cuban to joke that Musk could put "dogecoin in the U.S. Treasury," if Donald Trump retakes the White House next month. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has returned to its all-time high this year, surging as the Federal Reserve gears ... [+] up to begin its interest rate cutting cycle. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts predicted a so-called "debasement trade" could fuel a bitcoin price boom going into the U.S. election. Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by "persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar," according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade. "Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin," JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Title: India's IPO record shattered with $5.5 billion launch
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/indias-ipo-record-shattered-with-55-billion-launch/a-70499104
Time Published: 2024-10-18T08:41:00Z

India is the world's third-largest auto market, set for further huge growth before the end of the decade. South Korean carmaker Hyundai is banking on a Bombay listing to solidify its market position. The South Korean auto giant Hyundai launched its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, billed as India's biggest stock market debut, and was projected to be worth about $3.3 billion (€3.05 billion). The first carmaker to go public in the South Asian country since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, Hyundai offered 142 million shares for sale, representing about 17.5% of the total shares of its Indian arm. By the end of Thursday, the IPO was twice oversubscribed, drawing bids of $5.51 billion. Reuters news agency cited unnamed sources linked to the listing as saying that Hyundai would price its shares at 1,960 rupees ($23.31, €21.49t), giving it a market valuation of $19 billion. That would value the Indian unit at about 40% of its Korean parent. In a sign of the popularity of Hyundai's listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange, institutions, including foreign investors, bid nearly seven times the shares reserved for them. Nearly $1 billion in shares were snapped up by institutional investors on Monday alone, including the government of Singapore and BlackRock, the giant US investment firm, which picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million. Fidelity, meanwhile, bought shares worth $76.5 million and domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth $340 million. Hyundai India shares are expected to start trading on Tuesday (October 22). Already India's second-largest carmaker by sales, Hyundai is keen to build on the advantage gained by its early entry into the national market in 1996. Last year, Hyundai sold over 605,000 vehicles in India, a 9% increase from the previous year. It hopes the additional funds will help close the market share gap with leader Maruti Suzuki. India already has the third-largest auto sector in the world — and it is growing fast. Last year, more than 4.1 million vehicles were sold. The auto sector is a major pillar of the economy and the country's large, growing consumer base and urbanization rate, along with relatively low production costs, make it an ideal location for Hyundai to manufacture and sell its vehicles. India's government is keen to boost domestic electric vehicle production, which aligns with the Korean carmaker's strategy. Hyundai also sees India as a critical alternative to China and Russia, where sales have dropped because of geopolitical issues. The South Asian country offers a more stable environment to its peers. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Globally, Hyundai's IPO beats July's US listing by Lineage Logistics, the world's largest cold-storage firm, which was worth $5.1 billion. Hyundai's listing will also eclipse the 2022 IPO of the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India, in which the government sold a 3.5% stake and raised $2.7 billion. Other top domestic listings in recent years include fintech giant Paytm, whose IPO was worth $2.2 billion in November 2021, and Coal India, which went public in 2010 at $1.8 billion. India's stock market has been booming over the past four years, growing by 210% between April 2020 — during the first pandemic lockdown — and last month. On Tuesday, the SENSEX, the index of the Top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was trading at 81,820. India recently pipped Hong Kong to become the fourth-largest stock market in the world. India's auto market has rapidly become ultracompetitive, and smaller domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have eaten into Hyundai's market share. "India is one of the most exciting auto markets in the world," Unsoo Kim, managing director of Hyundai's Indian unit, told a news briefing in Mumbai last week. "[The] IPO will ensure that Hyundai Motor India is even more dedicated to succeed in India." Hyundai plans to use proceeds from the IPO to enhance its research efforts and develop new cars, seeking to transform the country into a production hub for other countries in the Global South. Hyundai already delivers its India-made vehicles to more than 90 countries. "We intend to become a global manufacturing hub for Hyundai for the emerging markets," Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, told the Reuters news agency. "In [the] next 3-4 years, [a] 30% increase in production will improve our domestic and export volumes." The Korean automaker has already invested $5 billion in the country and plans to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade to help make its Indian operations a key plank of its electric vehicle (EV) production, as well as building EV infrastructure such as charging stations and a battery assembly plant. Hyundai currently has one manufacturing plant in India for local sales and exports. Production at a second plant is expected to begin operations in 2025, which will help take the firm's total capacity in India to beyond 1 million units a year.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Private finance experts met the Chancellor at No11 Downing Street today to boost investment in infrastructure and drive growth nationwide. Rachel Reeves convened the inaugural meeting of the British Infrastructure Taskforce as part of a new approach that involves government working with business to design policy that will unlock private investment, including by building business confidence in UK infrastructure investments. The Taskforce will explore different options to support the Government’s infrastructure goals to drive growth for the whole of the nation, and some of the UK’s biggest financial companies including LLoyds, HSBC, and M&G will be in attendance. This Government has committed to turbocharge infrastructure investment across the width and breadth of the UK. Invitees have been selected to ensure a wide range of experience and expertise in UK infrastructure. This marks a significant shift in approach, with key businesses and stakeholders invited to work with the government to support the delivery of its infrastructure agenda. It follows the announcement to launch a newly formed National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA) which will bring oversight of strategy and delivery under one roof. The NISTA will support the development and implementation of the ten-year infrastructure strategy in conjunction with industry which was outlined for the first time last week by the Chief Secretary Darren Jones. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves MP said: Increasing investment in infrastructure is a vital part of delivering on our number one mission to grow the economy and create jobs. Just days after our International Investment Summit, we are delivering on our promise to work with business to drive growth across the country, and the expertise of this Taskforce will be invaluable in the weeks and months ahead. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones MP said: We are serious about ending the cycle of underinvestment that has plagued our infrastructure systems for over a decade. The best way to do that is to design the solution with business in the room. That’s what this taskforce is all about. The Taskforce will meet regularly, offering insights that deliver long-lasting solutions for job creation, growth, and environmental goals. This builds on the success of the International Investment Summit, which saw hundreds of top international investors attend the event, £63 billion of confirmed investment into Britain, along with the launch of the £27.8 billion turbocharged National Wealth Fund. Tracy Blackwell, CEO, PIC said: We have a huge amount to invest and we want to invest more in Britain. There is no shortage of capital that can support the British economy’s capacity to grow. The right combination of policies and ideas will unlock that capital and boost growth. From planning reform and better use of public sector pension funds to a streamlining of institutions and regulations, there is a lot that Government can do to crowd in more private investment and deliver social value. It’s great to be in an ongoing conversation with the Chancellor about taking that agenda forward. Andrea Rossi, CEO, M&G plc said: M&G has been an active investor in the UK for 175 years. Of the £100 billion M&G invests in the UK, infrastructure remains a core part of delivering sustainable returns for our savers, clients and shareholders. The UK’s clear focus on infrastructure presents a significant opportunity to deliver economic and social progress and we are delighted to contribute our expertise.” Deepa Bharadwaj, Head of Infrastructure Europe, IFM Investors said: IFM is a major global infrastructure investor, a major investor in the UK, and is owned by pension funds. We look forward to solutions-based discussions that can unlock new investment across UK infrastructure sectors and themes”. Stephen Cohen, Chief Product Officer, Blackrock said: There’s a rapidly growing pool of capital to invest in infrastructure, but deploying it requires pragmatism in policy. We’re pleased to be working with the government in identifying policies that will support private investment. Charlie Nunn, CEO, Lloyds Banking Group said: At Lloyds Banking Group, we are committed to helping the UK deliver the infrastructure the country needs, supporting jobs and growth. We welcome the British Infrastructure Taskforce’s focus on increasing investment in UK infrastructure and addressing some of the fundamental barriers that have existed to date. As the UK’s leading bank for project finance, we will work closely with the government in the development of this taskforce, ensuring the work supports communities, businesses, and industries across the regions and nations of the UK. Anne Richards, Vice Chair, Fidelity International said: We have a shared ambition to drive growth in the UK by unlocking investment in infrastructure for the benefit of savers. Our best opportunity to achieve that is through collaboration with government and the industry.

Title: FinTech IPO Gains 3.7% as Upstart and Paymentus Lead Platforms Higher

Earnings season is barely a week old. While the headlines have centered on big banks, Wall Street trading and credit card spending, the deluge of quarterly reports has yet to be seen from the digital upstarts populating the FinTech IPO Index. We’ll get there for sure. But in the meantime, in the past week, the prime movers of the FinTech IPO Index’s 3.7% surge came through the platforms, where partnerships and new products represented a broadening of the features and services offered to individuals and to businesses. That’s not to say that all platforms rose in lockstep. Futu shares sank 16.3%. The company said this week that it had launched its ETF-based intelligent robo-advisory services, a new feature designed to deliver personalized investment solutions tailored to clients’ risk appetites and investment preferences. The company said it is working with BlackRock to offer Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios powered by BlackRock strategies and insights. Other platforms’ surges more than tipped the balance of the index’s momentum to the upside. As reported by PYMNTS, Paymentus — which saw its stock roar ahead by 24.3% — has introduced a tool to help insurers offer instant digital disbursements. The Paymentus Disbursements Accelerator added to the Guidewire ClaimCenter, and is designed to help insurers rapidly weave instant digital disbursement capabilities into their claims management processes. The accelerator, the release said, lets policyholders get payouts in the way they wish, including payments to digital wallets, credit or debit cards, ACH transfers or via check. Upstart’s stock gained 20.5%. In an annoucement late last week, the company detailed a programmatic purchase commitment from funds managed by Blue Owl Capital. Blue Owl’s Alternative Credit strategy will purchase up to $2 billion of consumer loans on the Upstart platform over 18 months. The transaction includes an initial acquisition of a $290 million personal loan portfolio, which closed in September. The transaction was structured and closed by Atalaya Capital Management, an alternative credit manager that focused primarily on asset-based credit investments across consumer and commercial finance, corporate and real estate assets. Alkami and Nutmeg State Financial Credit Union launched the latest version of its digital banking services with the Alkami Digital Banking Platform. The credit union’s members, per the announcement, have access to a wide range of online and mobile banking services, ranging from account aggregation, and financial wellness education and services. Alkami shares were up 5.7% SoFi is expanding its loan platform with a new $2 billion investment. The new “loan platform business agreement,” announced this week is based on funds that will be managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group. The agreement expands the capabilities of SoFi’s loan platform business, where the company refers prequalified borrowers to loan origination partners, while also originating loans on behalf of third parties. The announcement follows last week’s news that SoFi had added two new credit cards to its digital financial services offering: one for consumers who prioritize earning rewards on their daily spending, the other for those focused on building or improving their credit scores. SoFi shares added 14.4% through the past five sessions. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Byju’s was planning to go public in early 2022 with several investment bankers giving the firm valuation as high as $50 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier. He alleged that many of his more than 100 investors had urged him to pursue aggressive expansion into as many as 40 markets. But, he added, those very investors got cold feet when global markets tumbled following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending the venture capital market into a downward spiral. Raveendran said many of his investors “ran away,” and the departure of three key backers — Prosus Ventures, Peak XV, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — from the company’s board last year made it impossible for the startup to raise additional funds. Representatives of the aforementioned three firms as well as auditor Deloitte left the startup’s board last year, citing governance issues. Byju’s has since entered insolvency proceedings, and Raveendran, who no longer controls the company, said: “It’s worth zero. What valuation are you talking about? It’s worth zero.” Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup, counts BlackRock, UBS, Lightspeed, QIA, Bond, Silver Lake, Sofina, Verlinvest, Tencent, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Owl Ventures, and World Bank’s IFC among its backers. It has raised more than $5 billion to date. Raveendran said he remains hopeful that his startup will make a comeback. “I have nothing to lose. I came from a small village. I invested everything I had into the startup.” Topics Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is reportedly fundraising for a new AI startup DJI sues Department of Defense over listing as a Chinese military company What we know about the layoffs at Meta I just spent my first week ever with an EV, the Chevy Equinox — here’s what it was like 23andMe faces an uncertain future — so does your genetic data Claude: Everything you need to know about Anthropic’s AI Meta lays off employees across multiple teams Reporter, India © 2024 Yahoo.

Title: Ambitious James Culhane keen to push on after two seasons of stop-start
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/18/ambitious-james-culhane-keen-to-push-on-after-two-seasons-of-stop-start/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
It tells us much about James Culhane’s potential that despite being sidelined by various ailments and injuries, restricting him to just eight Leinster appearances during two seasons in their academy, he was upgraded to a senior contract in advance of this season. Now, after his second Emerging Ireland tour finished with him captaining the side to their concluding 33-24 win over the Cheetahs, Culhane could make his first start of the season against Connacht at the Dexcom Stadium on Saturday (kick-off 7.35pm). If so, it will be his first start for Leinster since the corresponding game in Galway which cruelly ended his season last December. “I tore my hammy and fractured my shoulder in the same game. So, there is a bit of trauma there. I think my hamstring is still somewhere around the 22-metre line of that pitch,” he says, showing a nice line in gallows humour. The injuries happened within two minutes of each other. “I did my shoulder first and was supposed to come off but I think Max Deegan had gone off for a ‘bloods’ so they were like ‘two minutes and then you can come off’. “Then we scored a try and I caught the kick-off. Right before I was to come off two lads jumped on my shoulder and I just went to step off my left leg and I felt it pop. I’ve never had an injury like that before, so I knew there was something seriously wrong. Then the scan said it all.” Having never suffered a hamstring injury before, he’d tore one off the bone. Now completing his degree in electrical engineering at UCD, his life is largely about time management, although his studies were a blessing during rehab. “I split my course up a little bit, but on average it is a 40-hour studying week, so it is tough to fit that in with training every week. But when I got injured, I had something to focus on and that was a big benefit. “I wasn’t just feeling sorry for myself the whole time. I’ve done well so far and I don’t think my parents [Paul and Margaret] would ever let me quit the college side of things, so I am forced to do it,” he says, smiling. Reared in Enniskerry, education has always been a priority for Culhane and his sisters Rosie and Lily, even though his dad was also a number eight who captained St Munchin’s, the Ireland Under-21s and Irish Universities (against a New Zealand team featuring Seán Fitzpatrick) before injury cut short his career. Like father, like son, they are both Arsenal fans, and Culhane was also a handy footballer with Wayside Celtic and Gaelic footballer with Kilmacud Crokes. He captained Blackrock College to the Leinster Schools Junior Cup in 2018 and would have captained the senior team in 2020-21 but for Covid. In Ireland’s Under-20 Grand Slam-winning side of 2022 his record carrying metres (349 from 66 carries) saw him named player of the championship, but he was soon hospitalised for a month with a kidney infection, probably the consequence of overtraining and dehydration. While that was excessive, it shows how driven Culhane is. Bright and humble, but ambitious too, he describes the Emerging Ireland tour as “another stepping stone” and an opportunity to work with Paul O’Connell. “He kind of knows everything, to be honest.” Culhane also gives an interesting take on the “freshness” of Jacques Nienaber and Tyler Bleyendaal. “When Stu [Lancaster] was in he controlled both attack and defence. He kind of did it all himself, so it’s good to get different eyes on things. Jacques has the new defensive set-up that we’ve never really experienced in Irish rugby before. That’s still something we’re learning, but we’ve made good ground on that. “Attack-wise, it’s not too dissimilar, Tyler really enjoys just ‘play what’s in front of us’ sort of thing so it’s not always too systematic, especially on transition, whereas in the past we would have just focused on playing our own system, not seeing outside of it. But Tyler really encourages players to take space if they see it.” Mature beyond his years, Culhane captained Leinster in preseason friendlies this year and last, further demonstrating they know they have a good one here. This is also a big season for him. Not in an arrogant way, but more stating the obvious, Culhane says: “I think it’s time now to push into this Leinster team and it’s pretty obvious once you’re in a Leinster team that you’ll find yourself in an Irish squad. So, that’s the goal. Especially in my first year of senior, I’m trying to make some moves.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin ‘To the moon!’ What’s behind Michael Saylor’s prediction?

BTC’s price rally fuels bullish sentiment, with supply shortage signalling more gains. Bitcoin [BTC] bulls are having a field day as their Uptober dreams appear to be turning into reality. This week, the king coin made a remarkable comeback, breaching critical resistance levels. On the 16th of October, the king coin climbed to $68,424, marking its highest price in nearly three months. MicroStrategy Co-Founder and Chairman Michael Saylor chimed in on the excitement, declaring, “To the moon.” His words captured the optimism among crypto enthusiasts, as Bitcoin’s surge fueled renewed confidence and excitement. At the time of writing, the coin had slightly pulled back to $67,458 but remained up by 0.97% over the past day and 10% over the past week. Aside from the positive price movement, developments on the supply side have fueled traders’ expectations for further gains. Firstly, Bitcoin miners produce only 450 BTC daily, which falls short of meeting the rising demand driven by ongoing accumulation from institutional investors. For instance, BlackRock recently added $391.8 million worth of Bitcoin to its holdings. Worth noting that spot Bitcoin ETFs hold total net assets of $64.46 billion, representing 4.82% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, according to data from SoSo Value. Additionally, the circulating supply of Bitcoin has reached 19.77 million, accounting for 94.14% of the total supply. Lastly, as per CryptoQuant, the Exchange Reserve has fallen to a five-year low of just 2.6 million BTC. As a result of these factors, the likelihood of a supply shock appears increasingly imminent. Source: CryptoQuant To gain deeper insights into market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, AMBCrypto analyzed the derivative’s data. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) recently reached an all-time high of $20 billion, signaling increased participation and interest. Source: CryptoQuant CME Bitcoin Futures OI also hit a record high, reflecting growing institutional involvement. Moreover, the funding rate was positive at press time. Data from Coinglass showed a Long/Short Ratio of 1.02, indicating a slight preference for long positions. These metrics suggested overall optimism in the market. Amid the favorable market environment, with Saylor eyeing the moon, it seems that the moon might be around $70,000. The 6-month liquidation heatmap from Coinglass revealed a substantial liquidity cluster at this level, with $72,300 and $72,600 emerging as the next magnetic zones likely to attract the price. On the downside, significant liquidity was concentrated around $67,000 and $65,000. If BTC drops to sweep these levels, a rebound could follow. Source: Coinglass Thus, given Bitcoin’s trajectory, bulls remain hopeful of reclaiming the record highs set in March.

Elon Musk endorses Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Photo: Getty As the US prepares to vote for a new president, the campaign here, and the candidates’ behaviour, should act as a warning to voters in Ireland and other democracies around the world. For more than a decade we have been plagued by far-right rhetoric and disinformation designed to activ­ate the worst instincts of people. Donald Trump’s cult-like following has debased our politics and our civic society, making us weaker, darker, more resentful, angrier and more polarised. It has enabled racist, ignor­ant, misogynistic, nativist groups to emerge and foment divisions that harm the nation and our social fabric. The appeal, however limited, of Independent Ireland and the move in Ireland to create a National Alliance of far-right groups is cause for alarm. Ignorance and disinformation are key to the growth of these movements. Democracies need to strengthen civic institutions, elevate civil discourse and educate young people to understand why it’s important to participate in their communities. Demagogues like Trump, Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson feed on the worst impulses of people, and they offer no constructive solutions. At the same time, mainstream political parties need to devise and seriously embrace policies that address problems including housing, healthcare, immigration, environmental devastation and economic opportunity. These are problems to be solved by serious, thoughtful political parties and policy-makers, informed by data and open to rational debate. Far-right demagogues who threaten democracies do long-term harm and need to be rejected by voters. Jim McManus, Massachusetts, US The slanted reporting of most journalists on the US presidential election is blatant. Their failure to report the truth is disappointing and harmful. Fair and balanced reporting is ess­ential to guarantee the authenticity of the democratic process. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin The electoral college, another 18th-century remnant, will deliver the presidency to Donald Trump or Kam­ala Harris next month, contradicting the popular vote and, for many, rendering the election meaningless. Until this outdated remnant is disbanded, US democracy will continue to discredit itself. It’s my contention that the vote of every US citizen should count – not just those of partisan electoral college insiders. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary When Sinn Féin forgot, or neglected, the historical reason for the depart­ure of Éamon de Valera and his followers to form Fianna Fáil (“a slightly constitutional party”), it was bound to run into its current difficulties. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said recently that Leo Varadkar “has found his inner Shinner”. I would say the Shinners have “found parliamentary democracy” a threat to their totalitarianism. Declan Foley, Melbourne, Australia Have some members of Dáil Eireann taken a pay cut? Convalescing following an illness, I watched proceedings in Leinster House at government “question time” and was less than impressed by the sartorial inelegance of some of our elected representatives. It looked like dress-down Friday, but it was only Tuesday. I also noted an urban/rural divide, with those deputies from beyond the Pale showing respect for their office, their constituents and themselves, in turning out dressed appropriately for the privileged positions they hold. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan Further to Tom Grufferty’s letter on kindness being “only in Ireland”, (Letters, October 17), I was reminded of a school trip some years ago when we visited several eastern Europe countries where the Irish students were intimidated by the stern attit­udes of border officials. It was only on their return to Dublin, greeted by border management personnel with jokes, smiles and being addressed by their first names, that they finally relaxed. Ireland of the hundred thousand welcomes indeed. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Rian Noctor reminds us of one of the greats of Irish rugby, Anthony ‘Axel’ Foley, whose death eight years ago at the age of 42 shocked the sporting world (‘“He’s always spoken about” – Munster aim for Stormers win as tribute to Anthony Foley’, Irish Independent, October 17). There’s a beautiful and striking riverside memorial stone to the rugby legend in his native Limerick at a place called Clancy’s Strand on The Three Bridges River Walk. Whenever I pass this stunning statue erected in his honour in this rugby-mad city, I’m reminded of how fleeting life is, but also how sport can be a force for good when played with the passion and excitement with which the former No 8 thrilled his fans. Munster will be hoping that the legend of Axel Foley will propel them to victory away to the Stormers in Cape Town this weekend. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry The Los Angeles Archdiocese has agreed to pay $880m (€813m) in response to sexual abuse claims. It appears many of these clerics didn’t read their Bibles. Matthew 18:2-6 states: “If anyone causes one of these little ones – those who believe in me – to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.” How can people supposedly devoted to doing right do what they did? There are so many clergy who do so much good, but there are a few that let the team down.

Here is a quote: “The Biden-Harris administration’s ban on new permits for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports threatens nearly one million jobs over the next two decades if the restriction remains in place, a new study finds. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) conducted a study in partnership with PwC that was shared exclusively with FOX Business and found that between 515,960 and 901,250 jobs – as well as about $103.9 billion in labor income – would be threatened if the ban remains in place through 2044. The analysis used the Department of Energy’s outlook prior to the ban announcement to calculate its potential long-term impact. The export ban would stifle the U.S. GDP by between $122.5 billion and $215.7 billion in 2044, while between $26.9 billion and $47.7 billion in tax and royalty revenues to federal, state and local governments would be at risk in 2044 if the permit pause persists, the study found.” o o o H.L. sent us this: Orange Juice Prices Near Record Highs Amid Fears Of Worst Florida Harvest In A Century. o o o H.L. suggested this at Zero Hedge: Dozens Of Meat Processing Plants Expected To Shut Down Under New EPA Rules. o o o A Historic Short Squeeze In Oil Has Only Begun. 2024 Harris Tax Proposals: Details & Analysis. o o o Donald Trump Tax Plan Ideas: Details and Analysis. o o o Bloomberg: 2024 Tax Calendar. o o o US budget deficit hits $1.8 trillion for fiscal 2024, per CBO.

Title: USDT Popularity Soars As Tether Adds Over 36 Million Users in Q3 2024

Tether’s USDT, the largest crypto stablecoin, recently celebrated its 10th year in the industry. The company’s growth has been impressive, thanks to its steady user base, holdings that include $97 billion in US government bonds, and its plans to partner with US law enforcement agencies to strengthen its brand. Now, the team behind Tether can find another reason to celebrate: data suggest that Tether’s USDT user growth recorded its best quarter in Q3 by adding 36.25 million new users. The company added that its quarterly user data has increased by 9% on average over the last 12 months, giving it enough cushion as it expands its use cases and applications. In a post at Tether.io, the company boasts of an increasing adoption of its stablecoin, reporting over 330 million in-chain wallets and accounts. The company clarified that these refer to users who have received the stablecoin by the end of the third quarter. This number excludes users who use the coin in centralized platforms such as Binance and Coinbase, which also numbers to several million. An October 16th report indicated tens of millions of Tether customers on these exchanges and off-chain venues. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, most users are from developing countries. He explained that the majority of users buy USDT to hedge against inflation and their country’s weak monetary systems. Part of Tether’s success in the industry is its support of tier 1 blockchains like Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain. According to the company, Ethereum-based layer-2 networks contributed the most users this quarter. Last year, Arbitrum and Polygon added the most users to Tether’s pool. Telegram’s The Open Network (TON) was also instrumental in growing Tether’s user base. According to Philip Gradwell of Tether, TON added 3.3 million users in six months, which accounts for 1% of all on-chain accounts. As Tether continues to pick up millions of new users, the company is looking for ways to expand its reach. According to reports, the company is studying ways to enter traditional finance through lending. The company has also invested in a few startups, like Bitdeer, a crypto mining company, and Blackrock Neurotech. However, its most exciting move this year relates to image-building. In a Fox Business interview, Ardoino shared that collaboration with US law enforcement agencies is doing well. If Tether improves its image, we can see more significant user growth in the next few quarters.
