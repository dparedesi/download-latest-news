Title: The Big Bad Republican Bill Wasn’t Regressive Enough for the Anti-Tax Crusaders

Mother Jones illustration; Samuel Corum/Getty It is apparently not enough for America’s anti-tax crusaders that Congress just passed one of the most expensive and regressive tax bills in our history. The Washington Post reports that Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and other conservative groups are now urging the Trump administration to change how investment profits are taxed—unilaterally, if need be—in a way that would overwhelmingly favor the wealthiest Americans. Sound familiar? Namely, they want to index capital gains to inflation. Suppose I bought $100,000 worth of Apple stock on July 10, 2020, and kept it. Today, I could sell that stock for $170,383—a tidy $70,383 profit. That’s a 74 percent overall return and an average annual return of 11.7 percent. Pretty good, right? Not good enough for Norquist et al. These players want to let me adjust the “cost basis”—the price I originally paid for the stock—for inflation. Using this inflation calculator, I could then tell the IRS that my initial $100k investment was in fact a $120,407 investment, and so my profit for tax purposes is only $40,976. This is insane—for several reasons. First, read the room. Congress just passed a megabill whose benefits are deeply skewed in favor of the wealthy. Its tax provisions and spending cuts, taken together, will result in a 4 percent increase in average after-tax income for the richest 1 percent of American households and a nearly 4 percent decrease for the poorest 20 percent, based on the Yale Budget Lab’s analysis. This is very, very unpopular. The bill will add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt—more like $5 trillion if expiring provisions are extended in the coming years. And indexing capital gains to inflation, according to 2018 estimates from the Tax Policy Center and the Penn Wharton Budget Model, would add yet another $100 billion to $200 billion to the tab—with the richest 1 percent reaping 86 percent of the benefits. “I don’t think reducing [capital gains rates further] will change investor behavior,” says billionaire Mark Cuban. Norquist told the Washington Post he recently spoke with President Donald Trump and recommended the president implement the change with an executive order. Indexing capital gains to inflation was considered during Trump’s first term, the Post‘s Jeff Stein reports, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin felt Congress should handle it—current secretary Scott Bessent may prove more compliant. “I said something like, ‘Mr. President, after we do the bill, we will need more economic growth,” Norquist told Stein. “The Big Beautiful Bill is very pro-growth, but with this, we can have even more growth.’” In reality, not one of the Republican tax packages enacted since Ronald Reagan became president has lived up to its sponsors’ economic promises. “The economy may well enjoy a sugar-high the next couple of years, as borrowing stimulates near-term consumption,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement after Congress passed the “One Bie Beautiful Bill” on July 3. “But a sugar-high won’t be sustained, it will do real damage, and often what comes next is the crash.” As for the notion of indexing fueling “more growth,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me in an email that he thinks the current tax rates on capital gains are fair, and “I don’t think reducing it will change investor behavior.” (He added that he would support even lower rates—even zero—under certain circumstances, for ordinary employees of a company that gets liquidated, as a way to reduce wealth inequality.) Yet the fairness of those rates—and their justification—is the subject of fierce debate. Suppose I’m a wealthy investor and I sell assets I’ve held for at least 12 months—stocks, bonds, real estate, or even, say, a stud racehorse—netting my family $1,000,000 in profits. The federal tax on those capital gains ranges from zero for the first $94,000 to 20 percent for the portion that exceeds $583,750. Because my spouse and I have income of more than $250,000, we also have to pay a 3.8 percent “net investment income tax.” This all adds up to an effective tax rate of about 19 percent. But tax rates for wage income are much higher. A couple reporting $1,000,000 in salary income pays an effective rate of about 30 percent. That’s a huge difference, and part of why families whose money comes primarily from asset growth have amassed wealth so much faster than working families have. It no lefty exaggeration to say America’s economic system is rigged against workers and in favor of investors. It’s right there in the tax code. “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing.” So how do conservative policy wonks justify the low capital gains rates? A key argument, interestingly, is that inflation eats away at the value of long-term gains. One “solution” would be to index the gains to inflation, notes the libertarian Cato Institute, “but most countries instead roughly compensate” by offering reduced tax rates for investors. And now the anti-taxers want to have it both ways. Investors enjoy other economic advantages, too. Notably, their gains are counted as income only when the assets are sold. In practice, this allows people with a large portfolio of appreciated assets to borrow against their holdings at single-digit interest rates and live off those loans instead of selling assets and paying a double-digit tax. As ProPublica discovered, many of America’s wealthiest families have been doing precisely that. (As a result, from 2014 to 2018, Jeff Bezos paid an effective income tax rate of less than 1 percent.) Or say you have a $100 investment that grows by 10 percent a year during a period of 2 percent annual inflation. The first year’s profit, after inflation, is $8. “But I don’t pay tax on that $8 until I sell, which may be decades later,” says Bob Lord a former tax attorney and associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. “I’m basically getting a free ride on the appreciation of that $8 portion of my investment.” Doesn’t that benefit, he asks, more than offset any detriment from inflation? And also, isn’t investing supposed to contain an element of risk management? Isn’t the ability to beat inflation part of what separates a savvy investor from a useless one? Indexing for inflation, combined with favorable tax capital gains rates and an exemption for unrealized gains—doesn’t that basically reduce investing to shooting fish in a barrel? It is worth noting, too, that most Americans work for a paycheck, and the ones who make their living via investing are by and large quite wealthy. More than half of Americans now own some stock, but not much. As of January 2024, per Federal Reserve data, 93 percent of US stock holdings were owned by the most affluent 10 percent of the population, and the richest 1 percent owned more than half of all public equities—not to mention private equities. Indexing gains to inflation “would really codify the notion that income taxes are only for people who work for a living,” says Morris Pearl, a former managing director at BlackRock and current chairman of the board of Patriotic Millionaires, a nonprofit that advocates for higher taxes on the rich. If the Trump administration were to attempt the change Norquist recommended—unilaterally or otherwise—its not even clear how it would work. You would presumably need to make changes on both the profit and loss sides of a balance sheet. Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has concluded that indexing is complex and unlikely to generate significant economic impact, and is therefore “more trouble than it’s worth.” “Indexing has been rejected in the past to avoid opening new tax shelters,” says Steven Rosenthal, a Washington tax policy expert and former legislation counsel for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “If investors were permitted to index their assets, but not required to index their liabilities, debt-financed investments would explode. Investors could exclude profits and deduct interest. But indexing both assets and liabilities is a mess, which I, as a congressional staffer, discovered when we tried to draft it.” “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing,” adds Patriotic Millionaires’ Pearl. “It’s absurd that all I would need to do is buy property that I can rent out, and make a lot of money, and never have to pay taxes again!” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Title: EU ‘has no money except for war’ – Hungarian official
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621327-hungary-eu-ukraine-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T09:58:50Z
Full Content:
The EU is placing Ukraine’s military needs above the priorities of the bloc’s member states, Hungarian government adviser Balazs Orban has said. He accused EU leaders of always finding money for “war” but not other causes. Leaders of EU nations are considering the creation of a new €100 billion ($117 billion) fund under the bloc’s upcoming seven-year budget to cover expenses for the Ukrainian government, Bloomberg reported this week, citing people familiar with the discussions. Budapest, however, has been a vocal critic of the bloc’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict since its onset. “Europe has run out of money – except when it comes to war. There is always 100 billion euros for that,” Orban wrote on Wednesday on social media. He warned that such an allocation of funds would likely lead to further proposals to spend EU taxpayers’ money on Ukraine. Orban pointed to Kiev’s estimate that it would require $1 trillion over 14 years for reconstruction and modernization, a figure shared by Prime Minister Denis Shmigal during a donors conference in Rome this week. “While Europe cannot climb out of its own economic, social and security crisis, Brussels would continue to finance the war – weapons instead of peace, new debt instead of a competitive Europe,” Orban said. Last week, Bloomberg reported that US investment firm BlackRock had abandoned efforts to attract private investors for a Ukraine reconstruction program. The fund was expected to be launched at the Rome conference, but potential participants reportedly expressed “a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty” over the country’s future. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky said at the event that “only friends are invited” to help rebuild the country. He reiterated his call to confiscate Russian state assets frozen by Western nations and transfer them to Kiev. Moscow has warned that such actions would constitute international theft. EU members have voiced concern that expropriating Russian assets could significantly erode global confidence in their financial systems. As an alternative, Ukraine’s backers have been imposing a “windfall tax” on profits from the immobilized Russian funds and channeling the money to Kiev – an approach Moscow has described as another form of criminality. Hungary has accused the EU leadership of inflicting major economic harm on member states through sanctions on Russia, and of wasting resources on a war effort that it argues cannot deliver a military victory over Moscow.

The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of above $1,16,000, marking a 101 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) gain. With momentum intact, Bitcoin could next target $1,20,000, and possibly more, if ETF inflows and macro conditions stay supportive. The Fear & Greed Index now signals “greed,” reflecting strong investor sentiment and sustained buying interest, observed Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex. He added that institutional participation remains a key driver, with $1.52 billion flowing into crypto funds over the last five trading days. Pankaj Balani, CEO & Co-Founder of Delta Exchange, expressed optimism on the next leg targeting $1,30,000 and beyond, with support from macro conditions and ETF inflows. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price triggered a short squeeze, where traders betting against it were forced to buy back in, resulting in over $1 billion in losses and accelerating the rally. The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Ethereum’s breakout past $3,000 and its brief lead over Bitcoin in futures volume at $62.1 billion reflects increasing risk appetite and expanding trader interest in ETH derivatives, Balani also said. Many altcoins followed the broader market uptrend, with GRIFFAIN, SAGA, GOAT, and SEIU rallying more than 20 per cent. “If Bitcoin keeps climbing, altcoins could see a surge in optimism and potentially even larger gains.” Institutional demand remains a major driver of this momentum, with US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion in net inflows to date. Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ shared that BlackRock alone holds over $65 billion in BTC, while corporate treasuries continue to accumulate. Macroeconomic shifts including a weaker dollar, rising treasury demand, and sovereign credit downgrades are further positioning BTC as a hedge. Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, attributed the rise in institutional demand to more favourable signals from the Trump administration in the US. “This rally is not just about price; it reflects how crypto is maturing into a recognised asset class within the global financial system. With smart regulations, policy clarity, and support for homegrown innovation, India can become a global leader in crypto innovation. India can’t afford to be on the sidelines and a time-bound plan to regulate crypto in India is the need of the hour. On the investor side, it’s encouraging to see most portfolios in green,” he said.

Title: Melting glaciers awaken hundreds of dormant volcanoes, threatening global chaos
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-07-11-melting-glaciers-awaken-hundreds-of-dormant-volcanoes.html
Time Published: 2025-07-11T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Key points: Glacier melt is destabilizing volcanoes, triggering more frequent and explosive eruptions. Historical data reveals that rapid ice loss following the last ice age unleashed violent volcanic activity â a pattern repeating today. High-risk zones include North America, New Zealand, Russia, and Antarctica, where pressure shifts threaten dormant magma reservoirs. Underground nuclear tests and deep drilling may artificially hasten volcanic awakenings, with catastrophic environmental consequences. Governments and corporations remain dangerously unprepared for the cascading effects of multiple eruptions, including climate disruption and mass displacement. Ice retreat, volcanic awakening: A ticking time bomb A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity. Fluid injection: Pumping fluids (e.g., fracking wastewater, geothermal injection) deep underground increases pore pressure in rock formations, lubricating faults and prompting slippage that results in earthquakes. Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events. Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes. Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

Title: Pentagon to become largest shareholder in Rinehart-backed rare earth miner MP Materials

The Defense Department will become the largest shareholder in Gina Rinehart-backed rare earths miner MP Materials after agreeing to buy $US400 million ($606m) of its preferred stock. MP Materials owns the only operational rare earth mine in the US at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas. Proceeds from the Pentagon investment will be used to expand MP’s rare earths processing capacity and magnet production, the company said. Shares of New York-listed MP Materials soared about 50 per cent to close at $US45.23 ($68.59). Its market capitalisation grew to $US7.4 billion ($11.2b), an increase of about $US2.5b ($3.8b) from the previous trading session. Mrs Rinehart, Australia’s richest person, saw her 8.5 per cent holding in MP via Hancock Prospecting add approximately $US211m ($320m) to her net worth overnight. Rare earths are used in magnets that are key components in a range of military weapons systems including the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines, according to the Defense Department. The US was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70 per cent of imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rare earths have been a central point of contention in recent trade disputes between the US and China. Ryan Browne Kevin Breuninger Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the Trump administration was considering making direct equity investments in critical mineral companies to break US dependence on China. MP Materials CEO James Litinsky described the Pentagon investment as a public-private partnership that will speed the buildout of an end-to-end rare earth magnet supply chain in the US. “I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalisation,” Litinsky told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Thursday. “We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny. We’re shareholder driven.” US miners are facing a unique threat from “Chinese mercantilism,” he said. The Pentagon investment in MP could serve as a model for similar deals with other US companies, the CEO said. “It’s a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want and make sure that mercantilism is not going to hurt our ability to do so,” Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon is buying a newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials’ common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $US30.03 ($45.55) a share for 10 years that allows the US to buy additional common stock. Exercising the convertible preferred shares and the warrant would leave the Pentagon holding about a 15 per cent stake in MP Materials as of July 9, nearly twice the 8.61 per cent held by Litinsky and the 8.27 per cent held by BlackRock Fund Advisors, according to FactSet data. MP Materials will build its second magnet manufacturing facility in the US to serve defence and commercial customers with support from the Pentagon. The facility, whose location wasn’t disclosed, is expected to start commissioning in 2028 and will bring MP Materials rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tonnes annually. This manufacturing capacity is enough to “meaningfully support US defense and commercial needs,” Mr Litinsky told investors on a call Thursday morning. Arjun Kharpal The Pentagon has agreed to buy 100 per cent of the magnets made at the new facility, called 10X, for 10 years after the plant is built to support defense needs and the commercial market. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are providing $1b ($1.5b) to help finance the manufacturing facility. The Pentagon is also guaranteeing a minimum price of $US110 ($166.86) per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, that is stockpiled or sold by MP Materials. NdPr is a rare earth compound used to make permanent magnets. If the market price is below $US110 per kilogram, the US will pay MP Materials the difference in a quarterly cash payment, Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon, in turn, will receive 30 per cent of the upside above $110 per kilogram once MP Materials’ second magnet facility is operational, the CEO said. The Defense Department negotiated a very tough deal, Litinsky said. “The taxpayers are going to make a lot of money,” the CEO said. MP Materials also expects to receive a $US150m ($227m) loan in 30 days from the Pentagon to expand its rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Title: BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale Dominate Crypto ETF Assets Amidst Institutional Interest

The firms’ offerings made up 85% of all crypto AUM, while separate research found 75% of investors expect cryptocurrency to soon become part of institutional allocations. Institutional investors expect cryptocurrency to become more prevalent in institutional portfolios and expect traditional financial institutions to dramatically increase their launches of digital asset funds in the near future. According to London-based Nickel Digital Asset Management Ltd., which partnered with research firm Pureprofile to interview 200 institutional investors and wealth managers for the project, 75% of respondents said they expect cryptocurrencies to become a part of institutional portfolio asset allocation within the next five years. Cryptocurrency ETFs are often used by institutional asset owners that seek exposure to the digital asset class. These offerings are dominated by three firms, according to research from ISS Market Intelligence, which, like CIO, is owned by ISS STOXX. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Grayscale Investments manage more than 85% of all crypto ETF assets under management, totaling approximately $123 billion, ISS MI reported. Fidelity offers exposure to bitcoin and ether through its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and its Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Grayscale offers exposure through four different funds.

The Nickel Digital survey also found that 66% of respondents said they see cryptocurrency as the asset class with the biggest opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the next five years, followed by private equity and emerging market equities at 64% and 61%, respectively. These investors expect more “traditional financial institutions” to launch crypto funds over the next two years, with 43% saying there will be a dramatic increase and 53% anticipating a slight increase. “Traditional finance firms are already making significant strides into the digital assets space and that is only predicted to increase over the next two years,” said Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founding partner in Nickel Digital, in a statement. “The views of institutional investors and wealth managers on the ability of crypto to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns helps to explain why that is the case, and why professional investors increasingly expect crypto to be part of institutional investors portfolio allocation.” The Trump administration includes a slate of regulators who are proponents of digital assets, including Jonathan Gould, an attorney who was confirmed by the Senate Thursday to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. After serving the first Trump administration, he was chief legal officer at Bitfury Group, a provider of crypto mining equipment and related services. Additional belief that interest in digital assets also follows the Senate’s passage of the landmark GENIUS Act, setting the stage for the enactment of the first federal framework for stablecoins. The House is scheduled to vote on the measure next week.

That distinction could become more important, as firms’ experimentation with security-based tokens potentially leaves investors confused—a concern raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week. A stock that’s natively tokenized on Ethereum, for example, would carry the same set entitlements that investors receive when purchasing stock through traditional means, like voting or dividend rights, Domingo said. Natively tokenized assets also have no counterparty risk, while avoiding any fragmentation issues, he added. BlackRock’s $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which Securitize helped introduce last year, is natively tokenized because, as the asset manager’s transfer agent, the firm manages and records the fund’s shares directly on-chain, Domingo explained. Transfer agents usually use proprietary databases instead of a blockchain. “The token represents 100% of the security,” Domingo said, pointing to crypto software platform Exodus’ stock as another example. “One token represents one share.” Exodus shares began trading as tokens on Securitize’s platform in 2022, but this year, interest in tokenization has renewed, with Robinhood unveiling tokenized stock trading on Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum last month, and Kraken pushing xStocks on Solana and other networks like BNB Chain. In a statement on Tuesday, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce recommended that firms structuring tokenized offerings, given their obligation to adhere to federal securities laws, should consider meeting with the regulator. Tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations, she underscored. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she wrote. “Tokenized securities are still securities.” Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at Seward and Kissel LLP who leads the firm’s blockchain and digital assets practice, told Decrypt that the conversation around tokenization pertains to crypto, but at the end of the day, it’s about policing securities under existing securities laws. “People sometimes feel that, because of the nature of the blockchain, crypto should be less regulated,” he said. “That’s not what we’re talking about here.” In some ways, Peirce’s statement represented a warning to investors, not long after ChatGPT maker OpenAI denounced Robinhood’s move to offer so-called stock tokens in Europe that are tied to equity in the tech darling. In response, Robinhood said its tokens give "indirect exposure to private markets” as “tokenized contracts that follow their price.” Indeed, Pierce said in her recent statement that a tokenized security, depending on the circumstances, could resemble “security entitlements” or a “security-based swap,” as opposed to equity in any private or public company. Robinhood’s stock tokens possess some features that appear aimed at creating a controlled environment for the product. U.S. customers are barred from buying stock tokens, they can’t be sent to other wallets or platforms, and users must be KYC-verified via identifying information. Kraken doesn’t allow U.S. customers to purchase xStocks either, but the tokens, which are issued by a firm called Backed, are permissionless, meaning that they can be freely traded on a decentralized exchange or independently adopted by any platform. As the SEC urges market participants to consider federal securities, the regulator is trying to stick to a collaborative approach to crypto under U.S. President Donald Trump, as reflected by a roundtable discussion on tokenization hosted by the SEC in May. “In recent history, we seem to have forgotten a very fundamental concept: that investors and issuers have valuable observations and experiences,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and now-defunct crypto exchange FTX once dabbled in tokenized stock trading—but those products were ultimately shelved. Crypto lending platform Abra began offering contracts as tokens to customers in 2019 that allowed them to gain exposure to price moments of certain U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. The company “voluntarily ceased offering” the tokens after cooperating with an SEC investigation, according to a CFTC filing. In 2020, the SEC and CFTC ordered Abra to pay each agency a $150,000 penalty for allegedly offering unregistered securities and engaging in unlawful off-exchange swaps trading. Abra agreed, “without admitting or denying the findings.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Share this article Aptos Labs, the development team behind the Aptos layer 1 blockchain, has appointed Solomon Tesfaye as its new Chief Business Officer, strengthening its executive team at a time of rapid growth in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional blockchain adoption. Tesfaye previously served as Head of Capital Markets at Aptos, where he led efforts to connect the blockchain to traditional financial players. His leadership enabled Aptos to build partnerships with institutions including BlackRock, Apollo, and Franklin Templeton, helping to position the network for deployment in crypto ETPs and ETFs in both the US and Europe. “Solomon has been critical in shaping our Global Trading Engine vision and forging the partnerships that will help make it a reality,” said Avery Ching, Co-Founder and CEO at Aptos Labs. “As CBO, he’ll be key to scaling that work, bringing more institutions, markets, and real-world use cases onto Aptos as global web3 adoption continues to accelerate.” With more than a decade’s experience in investment banking, venture capital, and digital asset strategy, Tesfaye is expected to lead Aptos Labs’ push into financial services infrastructure, institutional onboarding, and scalable tokenization. His focus will include driving global enterprise partnerships in fintech, payments, and asset management, advancing strategic initiatives and business development, opening new markets and use cases for on-chain finance. Aptos is expected to benefit from pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, which promise improved regulatory clarity and enhanced support for crypto businesses. “With the US nearing the completion of frameworks for next-generation financial services, Aptos Labs is well-positioned to lead the shift to on-chain assets and help shape the infrastructure of tomorrow’s global markets,” said Tesfaye in a statement. “I’m excited to forge the partnerships and integrations that institutions and other market participants need to fully harness Aptos’ tokenization capabilities at scale.” The leadership change comes amid accelerating adoption, as Aptos surpasses $540 million in tokenized real-world assets, with institutional integrations having doubled since the start of 2025.

Title: Airbnb Host Refuses To Let Renters Stay In The Unit They Reserved, So They Complain To Airbnb Who Kicks The Host Off The App

by Jayne Elliott Shutterstock/Reddit It used to be that if you wanted to travel somewhere and needed a place to stay, you had to stay in a hotel, but websites like Airbnb have changed that. Now, there are a lot more options! The problem with sites like Airbnb is that not all rentals and not all rental hosts are created equal. I’ve used Airbnb multiple times and had great experiences, but there have been a couple times I thought, “I’ll never stay there again!” Thankfully, I’ve never had an experience as bad as the guy who wrote this story. His experience is so bad that he had to complain to Airbnb about it multiple times to gets the problem resolved, but in the end, it did get resolved in everyone’s favor except the Airbnb host! Let’s see what happens. In around 2019 I had a friend coming to visit for Paddy’s Day. Now I’m Irish, but he’s actually from Hong Kong. Given that I’m local, I said I’d take care of booking accommodation etc. I went on and of course as usual everything was like half a grand (welcome to Dublin…). Obviously things were maxed out due to it being Paddy’s Weekend. But I found one spot in Blackrock, which isn’t in the city centre but is only a few stops away on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit), that was going for €68 per night! I booked it right then and there. Then something weird happened. The following morning I got a notification from AirBNB saying the host wanted to up the price by €288.28, and if I would accept that. I clicked no and figured hey, he’s already accepted our booking, I don’t have to say yes to this! I waited the few weeks until the weekend in question, and then it came. My friend landed at Dublin Airport, we made our way to Blackrock, got to the door, rang the doorbell, and… nothing. This is even weirder. There was no car in the driveway, nobody was home. We hung around for forty minutes until the host arrived, and he wouldn’t. Even. Look us in the eye. I said hi, we’ve a booking to stay here this weekend? And he mumbled something about how no one was staying there sorry and he went inside. Airbnb tried to make it right. Well I got straight onto AirBNB. They offered us our money back, and I said no, that’s not good enough, everywhere else is half a grand what are we going to do with €68? So they offered us double, and I still said no, we need a place to stay! So they booked us into a lovely house elsewhere that was closer to the city centre. It gets even better! But that’s not all. I made an official complaint about the host and how he screwed us over, and they booted him off the app! For trying to fleece a couple of twenty-something lads, he had to stop renting his place out entirely! I’m a petty guy, so every couple of months I randomly think about this and check to see if he’s back online yet. As of May 2025, he’s still not. So I’ve cost him over six years of AirBNB rent (and counting). You love to see it. That Airbnb host really should’ve just let the guys rent the place for the agreed upon price. Let’s see how Reddit reacted to this story. Here’s the perspective of someone who hasn’t used Airbnb. A former Airbnb host shares hatred for the service. This person finds the request to pay more pretty unusual. It’s possible the host listed the unit somewhere else. Or maybe the host sold the rental. At least Airbnb made it right for the renter. That’s something. If you liked that post, check out this post about a woman who tracked down a contractor who tried to vanish without a trace.

Learn more and register today. – Sarah Morton Two years ago, I took on the role of editor for Crypto for Advisors at a pivotal moment. It was mid-2023, and the cryptocurrency industry was in the midst of a deep winter. The collapse of major lending platforms and the implosion of FTX had sent shockwaves through the markets. The U.S. regulatory climate was hostile, marked by enforcement-first tactics, and confidence was shaken. But even then, the undercurrents of something bigger were impossible to ignore. Fast forward to today, and we’re standing on the edge of what Bank of America calls a “once-in-a-millennium transformation.” They’re not talking about memes or speculation. They’re talking about the reshaping of global financial infrastructure, economic models, and digital ownership — and it’s being driven by crypto. An Ode to Bitcoin: The Genesis “Bitcoin belongs in the same breath as the printing press and artificial intelligence.” — Bank of America: Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, created something revolutionary: a decentralized, fixed-supply digital currency. It belonged to no government, no corporation, and no central authority. From there, a movement began. Early adoption saw students tinkering with GPUs, developers building wallets, entrepreneurs launching exchanges, and miners chasing cheap power around the globe. A technological and economic revolution took shape. Today, we’re seeing bitcoin ETFs from the world’s largest asset managers — BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale being the top three by AUM — and even nation-state adoption as countries like the U.S. and UAE race to become global crypto hubs. It’s an unparalleled acceleration of financial innovation. The Rise of Ethereum and Smart Contracts Bitcoin sparked the fire, but Ethereum — and the smart contract innovation it introduced — brought utility, programmability, and the ability to tokenize everything: real estate, carbon credits, fine art, identity, equities, and even yield-generating protocols. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, tens of thousands of digital assets exist. And while investing grabs the spotlight, blockchain is quietly transforming supply chains, intellectual property, finance, and more. Public companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets. Over 140 public firms have announced bitcoin reserves. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken will offer tokenized equities, while retail platforms like Robinhood expand their crypto products. Access points are multiplying: direct-to-consumer platforms, ETFs (now in the hundreds), tokenized funds, and direct ownership. And the list keeps growing. The Landscape Has Changed — Are You Adopting? Only a handful of advisors were very early adopters but that’s slowly evolving. There’s broadening recognition of the opportunity — to support clients, protect relationships, and win new business. It's becoming increasingly common to hear from advisors that they are winning clients simply because they’re willing to talk about bitcoin. On the other hand, the lack of regulation, prohibitive firm policies, digital assets volatility behavior and overall uncertainty with a new asset class has caused hesitancy. Moreover, advisors have a lot to pay attention to —- and now learning a new — and always changing — asset class is added to the list! Despite all of this, clients want to access digital assets. Recent Coinshares survey data highlights that clients want the help of their advisors and expect them to be knowledgeable in digital assets. More than 80% of the respondents answered that they would be more likely to work with an advisor that offers digital asset guidance, and 78% of non-crypto investors say they’d turn to an advisor if crypto support were available. Notably, almost 90% said they planned to increase their crypto exposure in 2025. A Call to Action Blockchain is an infrastructure, crypto is more than an asset class and the technology extends well beyond investing. The industry is maturing,regulation is advancing andthe world’s largest institutions are developing on blockchain. As U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently, “Crypto is the most important phenomenon happening in the world today.” You don’t need to be a crypto trader or blockchain developer. But if you’re a fiduciary — a guide, a planner — you owe it to your clients to understand what’s happening. Education is key. In two years of curating this newsletter, I’ve watched sentiment shift from skepticism to curiosity to strategic integration. And we’re just getting started. I’m thrilled to be here with you on your crypto journey. Connect with me for ideas on future topics you’d like to see addressed. - Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc. Q. Why is the same digital asset priced differently on each exchange? A. Equities “plug in” to an exchange, allowing for one, centralized price. Crypto, on the contrary, is “decentralized.” This means there’s not one “plug” to price a digital asset. While crypto prices are based on supply and demand (as well as other factors), each exchange operates independently and therefore prices can vary between different exchanges. Q. How can I find reliable pricing data for digital assets? A. There are many digital asset index and data providers. Look for pricing that (1) comes from a reputable and trusted provider with a proven track record in digital assets, (2) has a transparent and rules-based approach to construction, and (3) lays out thoughtfully constructed criteria for how the pricing is captured. The index methodology is incredibly important. For example, if selection criteria of an index included “trading on more than one eligible exchange” with eligibility thoughtfully designed, then in the case of the FTX collapse, FTT (the exchange token of FTX) wouldn’t have made it into the index. Thoughtful construction can rule out bad actors. Q. Why are people using bitcoin to measure the entire digital asset landscape? A. While bitcoin now accounts for 65% of the total digital asset market, there were times bitcoin was less than 40% of the market. One asset should not be a benchmark for the entire asset class. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Effective benchmarking must serve multiple constituencies—enabling performance evaluation, supporting investment strategies, and setting industry standards for everyone. Indices such as CoinDesk 5 (CD5), CoinDesk 20 (CD20), CoinDesk 80 (CD80), CoinDesk 100 (CD100) and CoinDesk Memecoin (CDMEME) were constructed to meet the needs of those looking to benchmark, trade and/or invest in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. - Kim Klemballa, CoinDesk Indices Keep Reading Kim Greenberg Klemballa contributed reporting.

Title: Bitcoin Blasts to $112,017 ATH – What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Surge?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now’s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin’s surge. It’s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. “The President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.” Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC’s natural supply. In addition, “BlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we’ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.” Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin. And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $CRO – the native token of the ETF’s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com. With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures, and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you’re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you’re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor’s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That’s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins, DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you’re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER. It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. It’s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. That’s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It’s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it’s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. The America Party Token ($AP) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk’s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: “Fiat is useless, so yes.” Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 – up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. As Saylor put it, “Bitcoin is moving higher.” And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC’s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER, $BEST, and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we’re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment.

Title: The Persecution of Francesca Albanese. Chris Hedges

Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:06:33Z

When the history of the genocide in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning. Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable. She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world” that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “Genocide as colonial erasure,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “A Genocide Foretold.” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true, as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue. The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted. She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here or watch below. Her latest report lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur. Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S. and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression, the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter, the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?” Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers, checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations, brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance, are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: $21M Flows Into First US Solana ETF as Snorter Token Approaches $1.7M Milestone
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/21m-flows-into-us-solana-etf-snorter-token-spikes/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:51:16Z
Full Content:
On July 8, the first US-listed spot Solana ETF – Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) – recorded $21M in net inflows. Impressively, this pushed its total inflows to a hefty $41.2M in the first four days of launching. That single-day surge surpassed the $2.02M raised in the previous three trading sessions, effectively more than doubling the total inflows into the ETF. This is fantastic news for Solana. SSK’s ability to attract more users and capital significantly boosts the network’s visibility, liquidity, and overall credibility, positioning it for even greater success moving forward. As such, it’s highly bullish for Solana-based projects, like Snorter Token ($SNORT). Already, it has nearly raised $1.7M owing to being the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot slated to launch in Q3 2025. Still, SSK’s footprint remains relatively small compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Despite doubling on July 8, the $41.2M in inflows represents just 0.5% of Solana’s market cap, far below Bitcoin’s 0.34% and Ethereum’s 0.3% penetration rates during their ETF launches. This gap primarily stems from SSK’s structure. Around 40% of its assets are tied to offshore Solana ETFs, whereas the rest is directly invested in $SOL. The SSK ETF’s impressive doubling highlights the growing early institutional interest in Solana. Should the SEC approve pending Solana ETF applications from Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale, it could trigger a fresh wave of capital into the network. As demand for the blockchain continues to rise, Solana-based projects like $SNORT are poised to benefit from the increased activity. Now could be the perfect time to explore these low-cap opportunities before they gain significant traction. $SNORT is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot currently under development. Built directly on Telegram, it promises to make trading the best meme coins faster, safer, and easier. The bot will enable you to manage every part of your trading strategy from the fourth-largest messaging app worldwide: spot new tokens, snipe launches, place trades, and set stop losses. All will be achieved without compromising security. Snorter Bot will include real-time honeypot detection, rug pull alerts, and MEV protection. By doing so, it’ll shield you from malicious tokens and front-running attacks so that you don’t get caught off guard. Given that $2.2B in crypto was stolen last year, protective trading platforms like Snorter Bot have never been more necessary. It’ll initially go live on Solana to take advantage of the network’s low fees and high-speed transactions. After that, it’ll expand to EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. Beyond granting reduced fees, $SNORT also unlocks governance rights (anticipated around Q4 2025), additional premium features, and high-yield staking rewards, currently offering a 218% APY, which is not to be overlooked. In fact, there’s no better time to lock up some $SNORT. As more investors join the project, this percentage is likely to decrease, resulting in higher returns while also enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. It’s no wonder $SNORT has quickly raised $1.6M+ on presale in just a few months and shows no signs of slowing down. Solana’s recent ETF inflows are a clear sign of growing institutional interest, signaling a strong upward trend for the network. With the potential approval of more ETF applications by the SEC, even greater capital could flow into the blockchain. This bodes well for Solana-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT), which stand to benefit from the increased activity and investment. You can buy $SNORT on presale for as low as $0.0977 to get the most out of the Snorter ecosystem. Once listed on the best crypto exchanges, as promised around the end of the year, it’s projected to hit $0.94. Thereby, there’s no better time to join for potential 861% gains.

Title: The SEC Is Crashing the Digital Stocks Party
URL: https://gizmodo.com/the-sec-is-crashing-the-digital-stocks-party-2000627381
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:20:28Z
Full Content:
For years, the promise of blockchain technology has captivated the financial world, hinting at a future where traditional assets are transformed into nimble, digital “tokens.” This vision, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce puts it, is “enchanting, but not magical.” SheÂ just sent a clear message to anyone hoping blockchain would free them from financial regulation: not so fast. Commissioner Peirce acknowledged the promise of tokenization, the process of turning real-world assets like stocks into blockchain-based digital tokens. But she warned that, no matter how futuristic it sounds, the same old rules still apply. âTokenized securities are still securities,â Peirce said in a statement. âThe same legal requirements apply to on- and off-chain versions of these instruments.â Her statement comes amid a frenzy of experimentation in tokenized finance. Firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Robinhood Markets are exploring how to tokenize everything from stocks and treasuries to real estate and private credit. The hype is real: blockchain-based markets promise 24/7 trading, faster settlement, better transparency, and a radically cheaper financial system. But the SEC is reminding everyone that innovation doesnât mean exemption. If youâre creating or selling tokenized securities, even if you’re just wrapping real assets in a digital shell, youâre still subject to decades-old laws governing how financial instruments are issued, traded, and disclosed. The goal of federal securities laws is to protect investors and ensure fair, orderly markets. The End of the Stock Market As We Know It Tokenization refers to the creation of digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets. These can be as simple as company shares or as complex as bundles of loans. Think of it as taking something traditionalâlike a Tesla stockâand putting it into a blockchain wallet so it can be traded like cryptocurrency. But not all tokens are created equal. Some are issued directly by the company (like a tokenized share of a public company), while others are created by third parties who hold the real assets and issue their own tokenized version. According to Peirce, those third-party tokens carry âunique risks,â especially for retail investors who may not actually own the underlying asset. âA token could be a âreceipt for a security,â which is itself a security but is distinct from the underlying security,â Peirce explained. Or worse, it could qualify as a âsecurity-based swap,â whichÂ are typically used by sophisticated investors and are heavily regulated, often restricted from being traded by everyday people (“retail persons”) off of regulated exchanges. If a token falls into this category, it could face severe trading restrictions. Tokenization could reshape how regular people invest, borrow, and access wealth. But it also raises serious questions: Who actually owns these tokenized assets? What happens when a crypto firm collapses or loses customer funds? And what protections do Main Street investors have? Tokenization could make markets faster and more accessible, even allowing people to own fractions of stocks and assets. But Peirceâs statement throws cold water on the idea that blockchain makes all that risk-free. The SECâs message is that innovation must come with compliance. Peirce, one of the more crypto-friendly voices at the agency, still made it clear: âThe process of issuing an instrument representing a security is not new.â Whether it lives on-chain or off-chain, itâs still under the SECâs jurisdiction. Peirce encouraged firms to engage with the SEC early and often if they want to build tokenized products legally. She also hinted that the agency is open to modernizing outdated rules or creating exemptions, but only if firms play by the rules. For now, the crypto and finance industries have been put on notice. Tokenized finance isnât a legal gray zone. Itâs Wall Street on-chain. The message is clear: the future of finance will be built on innovation, but also on accountability.

Title: Former Irish swimming coach George Gibney agrees to extradition from US to face 79 charges for sexual offences

LAST UPDATE | 10 Jul FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney, who is facing up to 79 charges, including attempted rape, relating to the alleged sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland, has agreed to be extradited from the US to Dublin. Gibney, who was arrested in Florida last week, has withdrawn his application to contest his extradition ahead of a court appearance tomorrow, according to court documents seen by The Journal. The 77-year-old was living in the US for 30 years and was wanted for 79 alleged sexual assault offences, 78 for indecent assault and one for attempted rape, against four girls between 1 January 1971 and 14 August 1974. Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. He was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993, which were dropped in 1994 after Gibney secured a High Court injunction which prevented the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from prosecuting him. Gibney then left Ireland for Scotland, where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a Garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. Advertisement A specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau launched a detailed inquiry after a garda probe was reopened in 2020 when several people made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. Court documents relating to the case, lodged last week, refer to the podcast series extensively. The podcast series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by the accused. A number of alleged victims emerged after an appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. He was arrested in Florida last week, where he has been living for nearly three decades, on foot of an international warrant which was issued by Irish authorities. It is understood that Irish and US law enforcement had prepared for the arrest for over a week. Gibney appeared before Orlando District Court Judge Daniel Irick for 11 minutes last week. He was remanded in the custody of US Marshals to appear before the same judge tomorrow for a detention hearing. Court documents filed ahead of the hearing yesterday, which have been seen by The Journal, state that Gibney withdrew his application to contest the extradition and agreed to being extradited to Ireland after being advised of his rights earlier this week.

Title: Wall Street Quietly Braced For Crypto ‘Floodgates’ To Open As Bitcoin Suddenly Tops All-Time High Price

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has topped its previous all-time high, climbing above $112,000 per bitcoin as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirms wild bitcoin rumors. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, climbing thanks to a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto and Wall Street piling into bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—with a “huge” BlackRock ETF bombshell suddenly appearing on the horizon. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that some think could be about to flow into bitcoin and crypto, a closely-watched Wall Street analyst has predicted the “floodgates” are about to open for crypto ETFs.

More predicting the bitcoin rally could be just getting started. The bitcoin and crypto ETF landscape is braced for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds and create a "framework" that would make the approval process for future crypto ETF applications much quicker, according to a report by The Block that cited an anonymous source. "Then we will see the floodgates open on these other assets, but that’s what I’m waiting for," Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on an X Spaces broadcast, adding he expects a draft of the framework could emerge as soon as this month, with implementation possible by September or October. The SEC, which has pivoted from being hostile to bitcoin and crypto under the Biden administration to pro-crypto under Trump, has issued new guidance this month on disclosure requirements for exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies, described by Reuters as “the first step toward approval of dozens of applications for ETFs linked to everything from solana and XRP to president Donald Trump’s eponymous meme coin.” "The SEC is moving forward on creating a framework for how they’d like to see all these crypto assets included in investment funds" to address the "explosion" in the number of ETFs now awaiting a regulatory verdict, Sui Chung, chief executive of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, told the newswire.

BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $77 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Title: Ethereum outshines Bitcoin, but ETH’s ATH still out of reach – Why?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-outshines-bitcoin-but-eths-ath-still-out-of-reach-why/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T09:00:55Z
Full Content:
Ethereum is spinning up like a quiet tornado, but still waiting to break free. Zooming in, Ethereum [ETH] seems to be charting its bull path as risk appetite returns. It’s up nearly 30% in under three weeks, about 3x Bitcoin’s [BTC] gains over the same period. The ETH/BTC pair echoes this rotation with a 20% surge, amplified by Bit Digital’s move to swap 280 BTC for ETH, signaling growing investor conviction. Altogether, Ethereum’s Q3 is off to a strong start, echoing its Q2 trend where it outperformed Bitcoin by 1.2x. And yet, the price still hasn’t fully priced in this momentum shift, even as Bitcoin enters price discovery. Ethereum’s market dominance is edging back toward the 10% mark, placing its valuation around $347 billion. Still, it remains a distant second to Bitcoin’s commanding 60%+ market share. The divergence isn’t random. Since breaking into six figures, Bitcoin has notched three fresh all-time highs, the latest peaking at $111,936 on the 9th of July. In contrast, Ethereum hasn’t posted a $3k close in over five months, still trading 43% below its 2021 ATH of $4,891. And despite recent strength, the ETH/BTC ratio remains heavily suppressed, having yet to recover even 50% from its five-year low of 0.018 posted in early Q2. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Even so, Q2 felt like a shift. For the first time since the 2021 cycle, ETH outpaced BTC in quarterly performance. And this outperformance wasn’t a random bounce. Institutional allocation into Ethereum is hitting escape velocity. Five publicly visible treasury holders now control 240,000 ETH, Trump’s disclosed crypto portfolio is 95% ETH, and BlackRock now commands 42% of market share with $4.45 billion in ETH holdings. That’s a textbook setup for a supply-side squeeze. And yet, price action still lags, leaving the market to question whether Ethereum’s breakout is the beginning of its structural shift, or just another temporary blip in a Bitcoin-dominated cycle. Ethereum’s breakout case is building. Price has cleanly breached the $2,815 resistance, with momentum eyeing a test of $3,000. If the structure holds, upside continuation is in play. But the catch is, can ETH decouple if BTC slips? So far, evidence says no. Despite stronger fundamentals and ecosystem growth, ETH remains cycle-bound to Bitcoin. Even in May, while Etheruem consolidated and Bitcoin pulled back from all-time highs, ETH still underperformed sharply, dropping 24%, twice the drawdown of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Critics argue Ethereum faces an identity dilemma, torn between being a utility protocol or a growth asset, unlike Bitcoin’s clean monetary pitch. Since December, Ethereum has seen major protocol upgrades, yet on-chain demand remains flat. Unless ETH breaks this structural correlation with BTC, a new all-time high stays out of reach.

Title: Bitwise Says the Next Trillion-Dollar Crypto Wave Could Start With These 4 Tokens

The growing crypto push toward on-chain financial assets is drawing attention from institutional investors and analysts. According to a recent client note from Bitwise Asset Management, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Chainlink (LINK) may be among the most direct beneficiaries of the emerging tokenization narrative. The report suggests that the surge in blockchain-based representations of stocks, bonds, and other real-world assets (RWAs) is no longer theoretical and could begin influencing crypto prices sooner than previously expected. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan and Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen outlined this perspective in their latest analysis. They argue that while tokenization has long been considered a future trend, recent milestones suggest the infrastructure and momentum needed to support adoption are already materializing. In the last month alone, Robinhood and crypto exchange Kraken have introduced tokenized stock trading platforms, built on crypto networks such as Arbitrum and Solana, respectively. Though currently limited to non-US users, Coinbase has also filed with the SEC to bring tokenized equities to the US market. Simultaneously, financial institutions invested $135 million into the Canton Network, a Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for trading tokenized stocks and bonds. Participants in the round included Tradeweb, Citadel, Goldman Sachs, and DTCC, signaling institutional buy-in. These advancements come amid regulatory support, as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins labeled tokenization a significant innovation and suggested a pivot from punitive enforcement to proactive development. At the same time, real-world applications continue to emerge. One of Latin America’s largest exchanges announced a $200 million tokenization initiative on the XRP Ledger, and Galaxy Digital warned tokenization could eventually impact traditional exchanges like the NYSE. Collectively, these moves point to a shift in how financial markets could operate going forward. Bitwise’s report suggests that ETH, SOL, XRP, and LINK stand out as “clean” investment vehicles to gain exposure to the tokenization trend. Ethereum’s role as the foundation for Arbitrum, Solana’s adoption by Kraken, the XRP Ledger’s use in real-world asset programs, and Chainlink’s role in connecting off-chain data to smart contracts make them logical candidates for long-term inclusion. The note also emphasizes that diversifying across these crypto networks may be more effective than backing a single protocol. The analysts further referenced BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who in his 2024 shareholder letter asserted that “every asset can be tokenized.” With global stock and bond markets representing a combined $257 trillion, the total addressable market for tokenization is substantial. The Bitwise analysts added that even modest adoption, 1% to 5% penetration, could translate into trillions of dollars flowing through blockchain ecosystems. Bitwise’s conclusion: the tokenization narrative, once considered speculative, may already be shaping the next major cycle in crypto markets.

Title: Serial winner Gus McCarthy planning to carry his happy habit into the Ireland fold
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/07/10/serial-winner-gus-mccarthy-planning-to-carry-his-happy-habit-into-the-ireland-fold/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Gus McCarthy has never been on the losing side in a Test match or a Champions Cup game. It is a striking statistic for the 21-year-old Leinster and Ireland hooker. On Saturday he will look to maintain that record when Ireland take on Portugal in Lisbon (7pm Irish time). He has played 20 matches in senior professional rugby and suffered defeat just twice, both in United Rugby Championship (URC) games. McCarthy is a serial winner. He led his school, Blackrock College, to a Leinster Schools Senior Cup crown. He captained the Ireland Under-20s to a Six Nations grand slam and a place in the World Junior Championship final, where they lost to a brilliant French team. McCarthy’s progression from Leinster to Ireland debuts came in just under six months, via an Emerging Ireland tour. The ACL injury suffered by Dan Sheehan in July 2024 provided an opening, which the young hooker followed up on. He scored a try in his first cap against Fiji last November, provided an assist for three others and finished the match in the backrow because of injuries. The Leinster man then followed up with another try-scoring cameo in the 22-19 victory over Australia. McCarthy won two further caps off the bench in the Six Nations. That was a major achievement in itself as the two players ahead of him at Leinster and Ireland are currently away with the Lions − Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher. McCarthy said of his rapid rise from rookie to the Test environment: “I’ve been delighted with the opportunities I’ve got, but obviously I’m in Leinster and it’s a very, very tough challenge. I’ve got two probable Lions Test players in the same position as me. “I haven’t played a whole amount. I didn’t really get involved in any of the URC knockout stages and the latter end of the Champions Cup, but I did get quite a bit of game time in the middle of the season. It’s good to learn from the best, some seriously good talent. The competition is endless; it keeps you on your toes. “I wouldn’t say it’s frustrating. Obviously, I would like to play but I’m still very inexperienced. I try to take every opportunity I get and just bide my time.” He smiles when the word “meteoric” is mentioned. “It did happen sooner than I would have thought. I thought I was just going to be training for the first week of Portugal (in November) but then I got held on. “For the week of the Argentina game, I was back with Leinster and then I thought I was done, but I got the call on the Sunday night asking me to come into camp again and then I got named to start in that Fiji match. I wasn’t expecting it, but I was delighted to get a shot.” He was part of an Irish front-row alongside Jack Boyle (2) and Thomas Clarkson (6) that had a combined 12 caps when Ireland faced into last week’s Test in Tbilisi. Whatever about the callow nature of the team, squaring up against Georgia in a scrum is not for the fainthearted. It is a rigorous technical examination. While Ireland did experience issues initially in that facet of the game, they successfully worked their way through them and won the game 34-5. So, what was the scrum Test like? “I really enjoyed the experience of playing against that Georgian pack,” he said. “The Georgians are known for being a seriously strong scrum, big front-row, abrasive players. It was a great test for us as a young and relatively inexperienced pack. Everything wasn’t perfect but I think we did a good job and got stuck into them physically.” Saturday will provide a contrasting test, fast and loose in the sweltering temperatures of Lisbon and a Portugal side that will engage Ireland in a different way to Georgia. McCarthy can’t wait. He’s where he loves to be, in the match environment. Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Bitcoin hits record high of $112,055; crypto stocks rally in response
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-hits-record-high-of-112055-crypto-stocks-rally-in-response/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T03:27:36Z

Bitcoin has once again smashed through its previous records, surging past the $112,000 mark for the first time in its history to set a new all-time high on July 9. The milestone represents a significant achievement for the leading cryptocurrency as it continues to recover from the market aftershocks of US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and solidifies its position in an evolving financial landscape. As the broader crypto market continues its recovery, Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new record high of $112,055 on Tuesday. This fresh peak surpasses the previous all-time high of $111,970.17, which was set on May 22. The digital asset has been trading in a volatile range since then, with the area around the $110,000 level proving to be a significant psychological and technical barrier. Over the past several weeks, each time Bitcoin’s price neared this level, it was met with a combination of profit-taking from existing holders and increased pressure from short-sellers. This latest decisive break suggests a new wave of bullish momentum has taken hold. The journey of Bitcoin, first introduced in a 2008 white paper by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been remarkable. Launched in 2009 as the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency, it has grown to become the largest digital asset, with a current market capitalization of $2.18 trillion. At the time of this report, Bitcoin accounted for nearly 65% of the total crypto market capitalization of $3.4 trillion. From crossing the $100 mark in April 2013 to the $1,000 mark in November of that same year, its path has been marked by staggering growth. It first hit the $10,000 level in November 2017 and reached a memorable peak of $69,000 in November 2021. Following President Trump’s victory in his second presidential election, it set a new all-time high of $76,999 in early November 2024, before crossing the landmark $100,000 target in early December 2024. A key factor underpinning Bitcoin’s current strength is its growing acceptance within the traditional financial system. With the Trump administration signaling its validation of Bitcoin through its plan to create a strategic US Bitcoin reserve, and with the continued institutional adoption led by Wall Street giants such as BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the “king coin” appears to have found a more secure home, at least for now, within the US financial ecosystem. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, a prime example of this institutional integration, now currently owns 3.5% of the total supply of Bitcoin. The success of this and other spot Bitcoin ETFs has had a profound effect on institutional investment and has likely influenced the broader market optimism. While the new all-time high is a headline-grabbing event, some market watchers have noted that the build-up to this moment has been relatively slow and quiet, which they interpret as a potentially bullish setup for what’s to come. “Crypto feels so quiet, [while] bitcoin is ready to move,” wrote Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree, in a recent report. Morris pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility has been steadily declining, a pattern that has historically preceded large upward price movements. This sentiment was reflected in the performance of crypto-related stocks. Shares of Strategy (MSTR) were higher by 4.4%, trading at $414, just a few dollars shy of its highest level in 2025 (though still well below its record high of $543 set late last year). Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) was ahead by 5%, and Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) were both up by roughly 6%, all riding the wave of Bitcoin’s record-breaking achievement.

Longevity startup Circulate Health announced Wednesday that it has raised $12 million in seed funding to expand a pricey outpatient service it calls ‘targeted blood cleaning.' The treatment, known as therapeutic plasma exchange, removes a patient's blood, separates the liquid plasma, and then returns the blood cells with a replacement fluid. Circulate Health says this process clears out inflammation and biological compounds linked to aging. According to GeekWire, the procedure costs between $8,000 and $10,000 per session and is not covered by insurance. Since May 2024, the Seattle-based company says it has completed over 1,000 treatments in eight states through a network of 24 clinics. Don't Miss: Today's Best Finance Deals Circulate Health co-founder and CEO Dr. Brad Younggren told GeekWire that they "saw a lot of expected outcomes that would be consistent with cellular rejuvenation." A study published in Aging Cell by Circulate Health and Buck Institute for Research on Aging observed 42 participants, with one group receiving six plasma exchanges plus a dose of antibodies. That group experienced a 2.61-year average reduction in biological age, according to the company. However, the trial lasted only three to five months, and experts say more research is needed. Dr. Jeffrey Winters, chair of transfusion medicine at the Mayo Clinic, told the New York Times that the findings do not show the therapy leads to longer or healthier lives. The study's final blood samples showed diminishing effects, suggesting that any benefit may taper off over time. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Circulate Health operated in stealth for two years and officially launched in January 2024 when Younggren joined as CEO. According to GeekWire, his co-founder is Dr. Eric Verdin, CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. Khosla Ventures led the $12 million seed round, joined by Seaside Ventures and CSC Ventures. Robbie Schwietzer, former chief product officer at 98point6, also joined the Circulate Health team as chief operating officer, GeekWire says. “We incubated Circulate to explore whether a safe, well-understood therapy like therapeutic plasma exchange could counter the deleterious effects of aging, and offer broader health benefits like potentially removing microplastics from the body,” Khosla Ventures partner Alex Morgan said in the statement. “Early clinical results are promising, and we’re excited to continue backing the team as they work to make therapeutic plasma exchange more accessible to more people.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now The U.S. longevity tech market has pulled in $1.8 billion in investment since 2021, according to PitchBook. In 2024 alone, startups in the space raised nearly $300 million as investors doubled down on areas like epigenetic reprogramming and senolytics, fields targeting the root causes of aging rather than just its symptoms. Backed by visionaries such as Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman, PitchBook says the sector is gaining momentum despite regulatory uncertainty and long development timelines. Circulate Health's competitors include MaxWell Clinic and Next Health, both offering similar treatments. The difference, Circulate Health claims, according to Geekwire, lies in their replacement fluid: albumin instead of saline, and the addition of targeted antibodies. Younggren said their method aims to improve longevity outcomes beyond what traditional plasma donation protocols offer. While the treatment remains expensive and uncovered by insurance, Younggren believes it could help prevent costly chronic illness down the line. "This notion of making America healthy again fits right in with what we're trying to do," Younggren told GeekWire.

Title: Rex-Osprey spot Solana ETF doubles cumulative inflows to $41M on July 8
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/rex-osprey-spot-solana-etf-doubles-cumulative-inflows-to-41m-on-july-8/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T23:00:18Z
Full Content:
Despite the increase, the net inflow amount represents 0.05% of Solana's total market cap, well below the proportions registered by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The first US-listed spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) received $21 million of net inflows on July 8, lifting its running total to $41.2 million, based on Farside Investors’ data. The one-day addition to the Rex-Osprey’s Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) 104% of the $20.2 million raised over the previous three trading sessions, effectively doubling net inflows. [Editor’s Note: SSK isn’t a pure spot ETF. At least 40% of its assets are allocated to other Solana ETFs, primarily issued outside the U.S., with the remainder directly invested in Solana. This structure was approved under the Investment Company Act of 1940, differing from the approval route of the infamous spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Several asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have filed applications with the SEC to launch spot Solana ETFs. These applications are currently under review.] SSK began trading on July 2 with a 0.75% management fee, triple the 0.25% headline charge that BlackRock and Fidelity levy on their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. Comparing the first four trading days for each asset class reveals a disconnect between the flows and the market capitalization of the underlying assets. Bitcoin spot ETFs earned about $2.9 billion during their first four sessions in January, which is roughly 0.34% of BTC’s market capitalization at the time. Ethereum spot ETFs absorbed almost $1.2 billion over their opening quartet in late June, or 0.3% of Ether’s market value once Grayscale’s legacy outflows are stripped out, per the same dataset. By contrast, Solana’s $41.2 million equates to approximately 0.05% of SOL’s circulating supply, roughly 16.7% of the penetration level achieved by the earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum launches. One reason for the divergence is the cost. Rex-Osprey’s 0.75% levy ranks as the highest among US spot crypto ETFs, while its seed inventory of just $600,000 suggests limited authorized participant warehousing capacity. Fidelity and BlackRock launched their Bitcoin funds with seed baskets exceeding $300 million and fee-waiver schedules that decreased to 0.12% and 0.20% during the first year. Furthermore, Rex-Osprey remains the sole issuer of Solana ETFs that directly hold SOL. While the small base and higher expense ratio leave SSK’s early intake below that of its large-cap counterparts, the fund’s doubling on July 8 shows an incremental appetite from allocators undeterred by cost.

Title: Institutions Buy Bitcoin In Record Numbers, But Why Is Price Still Below $111,900 ATH?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/institutions-buy-large-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T23:00:09Z

Institutions like BlackRock and Metaplanet continue to actively accumulate Bitcoin, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. BTC has, however, remained below its current all-time high (ATH) due to factors such as tariffs and selling pressure from old whales. SosoValue data shows that BlackRock has officially surpassed the 700,000 BTC milestone and now holds $76.35 billion in assets under management (AuM). The asset manager’s Bitcoin holdings account for 3.5% of the crypto’s total supply of 21 million. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is now way ahead of Saylor’s Strategy and the second-largest Bitcoin holder, behind Satoshi Nakamoto. BlackRock has achieved this milestone in less than two years since its Bitcoin ETF launched. Commenting on this milestone, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the asset manager now holds 700,000 BTC and is 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi. The Bloomberg analyst added that IBIT has on average accumulated 40,000 BTC a month or 1,300 BTC a day. Based on this pace, the asset manager is on course to 1.2 million BTC in May 2026. Besides BlackRock, Metaplanet is another institution that is actively accumulating Bitcoin in record numbers. The company’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, announced that they have acquired 2,205 BTC for $238.7 million at $108,237 per bitcoin, achieving a BTC yield of 416.6% YTD. Metaplanet now holds 15,555 BTC, which it acquired for $1.54 billion at $99,307 per bitcoin. BitcoinTreasuries’ data shows that Metaplanet is now the fifth-largest Bitcoin treasury company, only behind Strategy, MARA, Twenty One Capital, and Riot platforms. Other companies like MARA Holdings, Semler Scientific, and ProCap BTC have also expanded their Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting the massive demand for the flagship crypto. Macro factors like the Trump tariffs continue to pose an obstacle to a new uptrend for the Bitcoin price. The US president recently sparked panic in the markets with his trade letters, which he sent to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, imposing a reciprocal tariff on them. These tariffs are set to take effect from August 1, and Trump has declared that he has no intention to extend the trade deadline again. The Bitcoin price dropped from its weekly high above $109,000 amid this development and is again at risk of reaching new weekly lows. The BTC price also looks to be facing selling pressure from old whales, which matches the buying pressure from these institutions. Bloomberg reported that early Bitcoin whales have sold over 500,000 BTC in the past year, which roughly matches the net inflows from the Bitcoin ETFs during the same period. One early Bitcoin whale also recently moved 80,000 BTC, raising concerns that they were looking to offload these coins. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: SEC pushes back decision on in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock Ethereum ETF
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/sec-ethereum-etf-decision-delay/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T20:35:04Z

Share this article The SEC has extended its timeline to rule on Nasdaq’s proposal to enable BlackRock’s spot Ethereum, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), to offer in-kind creations and redemptions, according to a new filing. The in-kind model under SEC review, which mirrors traditional commodity ETF mechanics, would allow Authorized Participants (APs) to transfer Ethereum (ETH) directly, replacing the current cash-based creation and redemption process to reduce slippage and simplify operations. In practice, APs would be able to deliver actual Ether to the ETF issuer in exchange for new shares, and redeem shares to receive Ether back, rather than settling them in cash. BlackRock submitted an amended S-1 registration statement to the SEC in May, seeking approval to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for its ETHA fund. The asset manager is also awaiting a regulatory decision on a similar in-kind model for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Other fund managers, including 21Shares, Fidelity, WisdomTree, Bitwise, and VanEck, have also filed to enable in-kind creation and redemption for their crypto ETFs. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has previously said that in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs are “definitely coming at some point.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Q&A: Will survivors of historical abuse in schools be compensated? And who will be liable?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/07/09/qa-will-survivors-of-historical-abuse-in-schools-be-compensated-and-who-will-be-liable/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T19:04:29Z
Full Content:
The Government has establishment a commission of investigation into historical sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools. What scale of abuse is thought to have occurred? An initial scoping inquiry was told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. It was told it involved 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools countrywide between 1927 to 2013. Most of these allegations were reported from the records of some 42 religious orders that run, or previously ran, schools in the State. When did this abuse occur? The abuse was mostly described as having occurred from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, with the highest number of reported incidents occurring in the early to mid-1970s. What prompted the inquiry in the first place? In a RTÉ Radio 1 documentary Blackrock Boys, broadcast in November 2022, brothers Mark and David Ryan outlined how they had both been sexually abused at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College in the 1970s, discovering each other’s abuse there only in 2002. The broadcast prompted a public outcry and a surge in allegations of abuse, mostly in religious-run day and boarding schools. Are just religious schools the subject of a scoping inquiry? No – it is all schools. The commission will have a remit to examine the handling of sexual abuse in all types of schools, primary and second level. This reflects the views of survivors. A scoping inquiry recommended that the commission’s terms of reference include the handling of allegations, suspicions and concerns of historical sexual abuse across all primary and post-primary schools. Will the voices of survivors be included? A “survivor engagement process” forms part of the commission. This provides a confidential space where they can share the impact of their experiences. It is not a legal process, however. Will survivors be compensated? That is the intention. Minister for Education Helen McEntee says further work is being done to examine the matter of financial redress and how any future scheme could be funded. This is viewed by many survivors as a measure of accountability for those responsible for sexual abuse in schools. Can religious orders be forced to contribute? Given the difficulties in extracting funds from religious orders in the past for abuse-related issues, many will be sceptical about whether this is possible. The Government says a further phase of detailed investigation and data analysis on this issue is essential. Ms McEntee has said “all potential levers that can be brought to bear to secure funding from those responsible for sexual abuse in schools” will be considered. This is likely to include looking at changes to the statute of limitations on civil claims and changes to the status of unincorporated associations, as well as looking at the assets that religious orders have. The reality, however, is that survivors do not know what they will get, or when, or if they will get redress at all – and there is no clear pathway towards ensuring religious orders pay into a scheme. Will the State be liable? It could be. Some campaigners, such as Louise O’Keeffe, who won a landmark case following abuse in primary school, argue that her case established the principle that the State had an obligation to protect pupils from past ill-treatment at school and should have put safeguarding measures in place to help minimise the risk of sexual abuse. Worries over the extent of the potential redress bill and its impact on the exchequer run deep. In 2023, for example, officials in the Department of Education outlined that a broad scheme would expose the exchequer to “unquantifiable and potentially enormous costs”. Earlier this year, officials in the Department of Public Expenditure warned that the recommendations from the scoping inquiry have the potential to “very significantly impact on public finances”. As of now, however, the State cannot confidently measure its liability, nor ignore the risk of footing the bill. How will the commission work? Mr Justice Michael MacGrath – appointed to the High Court in January 2018 and a judge on the Court of Appeal since June 2024 – will chair the commission. It is due to undertake preliminary work over the coming months and will seek initial expressions of interest from people who may wish to provide information to it. As with many other statutory inquiries, what are the chances of this dragging on for years? The commission has been given a time frame to report within five years. Ms McEntee said the terms of reference are set out “very clearly” to ensure it does not go over time. “There is a very clear pause within the first two years to make sure that the commission can highlight any problems that arise,” she said. “But also it works both ways, that the minister can then identify if issues are emerging, how the work is being done, and whether or not that will result in an outcome that is appropriate.” Are there implications for schools today? The report of the initial scoping inquiry found that current child protection systems in schools are “robust and effective”, but there are recommendations for further safeguarding steps. The department said it has already begun to implement these recommendations.

Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer (CIO) of crypto asset management firm Bitwise, is predicting an explosion in the tokenization of traditional assets. In a new blog post, Hougan says that the transition of stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) onto blockchains instead of traditional systems may happen much quicker than he previously thought. “I still think it will take more than a decade before the majority of stock and bond trading happens on-chain. But with major financial firms like Robinhood and Tradeweb positioning themselves for the transition today, I’ve started to wonder: could tokenization achieve 1-5% penetration in a few years? Could a dozen major pilot projects lift us to that level of market penetration? It seems possible, and it would translate into trillions of dollars … more than any other crypto application or asset, including Bitcoin. The narrative around tokenization is only going to accelerate from here – if Robinhood is rolling out tokenized trading, you can bet that Charles Schwab and others are studying it aggressively. I’d expect a wave of additional announcements this fall.” Hougan names several crypto projects that could give investors exposure to an RWA tokenization boom. “The cleanest way to invest in the rise of tokenization is to buy a basket of the top layer-1 blockchains and infrastructure plays: Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Chainlink, etc.” Hougan also notes how Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, highlighted the massive growth potential for tokenization of RWAs in his 2025 annual shareholder letter, saying, “Every stock, every bond, every fund – every asset – can be tokenized.” If Larry Fink is right, Hougan says the “tokenization market could grow over 4,000x in the coming years.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: France not fit to replace BlackRock in Ukraine – party leader to RT

The reported plans by the French government to replace US investment holding BlackRock in Ukraine are “unacceptable” for the EU nation’s people, the leader of France’s Patriots party, Florian Philippot, told RT in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. BlackRock had been actively involved in developing a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund aimed at financing post-war reconstruction projects, with plans to attract $15 billion from public and private investors, including commitments from Germany, Italy, and Poland. The fund, which was set to be unveiled at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome on July 10-11, is now on hold, and France is reportedly working on an alternative plan. Last week, Bloomberg claimed, citing informed sources, that BlackRock halted the search for investors for its fund earlier this year due to US President Donald Trump’s rocky relations with the authorities in Kiev. The sources also claimed that France has been trying to set up an alternative structure that could take the spot freed by the US company in the country. However, they questioned if the reported French initiative could succeed without the American money. Philippot told RT that the report by Bloomberg came as a “complete surprise” for him. He reminded that France is €3.4 trillion (around $4 trillion) in debt and is about to face “extreme austerity,” blaming the situation on the policies of President Emmanuel Macron. ”We are no longer properly funding hospitals, farmers, security and many other expenditure items. How are we going to replace a behemoth like BlackRock in Ukraine under conditions of total military, diplomatic, financial and economic uncertainty?” the politician wondered. The general public will be against the alleged plans by the government in Paris once more people learn about them, Philippot insisted. “This is obviously unacceptable for the French,” he added. The Patriots party leader said that Macron’s moves regarding Kiev “make no sense,” urging France’s immediate and “total military and financial disengagement from Ukraine.” He also suggested that BlackRock withdrew from Ukraine because it realized that it is inevitably going to suffer a defeat at the hands of Russia. “You do not invest in a country that is going to lose,” Philippot explained. BlackRock, which controls roughly $11.6 trillion in assets, owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, among many others. Armaments produced by these firms, which are supplied to Kiev by its Western backers, have seen extensive use in the conflict. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.
