BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he was caught by surprise at the breadth of President Donald Trump’s tariffs last week on many countries, including key US trading partners. “The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink said on a call on Friday with analysts after the company reported first-quarter financial results. The president imposed the steepest tariffs in a century on April 2, sparking markets to sell off around the globe. On April 3 and 4, the S&P 500 Index had its steepest two-day plunge since the March 2020 onset of the pandemic. “This isn’t Wall Street versus Main Street,” Fink told analysts Friday. “The market downturn impacts millions of ordinary people’s retirement savings.” The US is either very close to a recession or already in one, Fink said in a CNBC interview after the analyst call. He said he was shocked at the 10-Year Treasury’s reaction in the wake of Trump’s tariffs. Trump partially backed down on his trade war Wednesday, calling for a 90-day pause on “reciprocal tariffs” while keeping 10% duties on most countries. But Trump hasn’t wavered on China, with tariffs of 145% on imports from that country. In the short run, inflationary pressures and anxiety dominate client discussions, according to Fink. Investors have put an all-time high — about $950 billion — in cash accounts at BlackRock as of April, money that could eventually be invested in stocks, bonds and private markets, he said. “Yes, in the short run, we have an economy that is at risk,” Fink said. But he added that artificial intelligence and surging infrastructure demand present “transformative investment opportunities.” Fink also raised the prospect that investors will allocate more money to Europe in the future.

As of March 31, the world’s largest asset manager held $50.3 billion worth in ETF digital assets, about $5 billion less than in the previous quarter, according to the release. Still, among asset managers, BlackRock remained the leader in inflows with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) adding $2.7 billion and $548 million in inflows, respectively, during the quarter. The combined $3.1 billion represents about 3% of net flows into BlackRock’s products in Q1. BlackRock currently has 463 products listed on the U.S. stock market, according to Stock Analysis. As of Friday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF had nearly three times the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, totalling $45 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF had an AUM of $1.8 billion, less than the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF’s $3.46 billion footprint, although the latter is a conversion from an existing fund and has shed $4.1 billion since its ETF debut. Still, investors had less of an appetite for BlackRock’s crypto products in the first quarter amid a largely risk-off environment. Over the past 12 months, BlackRock’s crypto ETFs generated $30 billion worth of net inflows, averaging around $7.5 billion per quarter. IBIT has added about $39 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024. The price of Bitcoin fell 12% in the first quarter, representing the asset’s worst performance since the second quarter of last year. Ethereum’s price meanwhile collapsed 45%,its biggest plunge since Q2 2022), but BlackRock’s crypto ETFs still generated inflows. BlackRock, which first tapped Coinbase as a custodian for its crypto ETFs, recently turned to Anchorage Digital. BlackRock disclosed in filings earlier this week that it would now lean on the digital assets trust bank as an additional option for safeguarding digital assets.

Title: Consumer confidence craters as recession fears grow

U.S. consumers are growing deeply uneasy. According to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment has declined 11% since March. This marks the fourth consecutive monthly decline and a 30% decrease since December 2024. Typically, consumer confidence shows a partisan tilt, with optimism rising under one’s preferred political party. However, the April decline was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation,” according to survey director Joanne Hsu. The downturn reflects rising concerns over inflation, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and abrupt domestic policy changes. Many respondents cited trade and tariff developments as potential economic headwinds — though the data was collected before President Donald Trump’s latest tariff revisions, which paused levies on select countries while increasing them on Chinese imports. “Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession,” Hsu noted, highlighting deteriorations in expectations for business conditions, household finances, incomes, inflation, and the labor market. Notably, the share of Americans expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has more than doubled since November 2024 and now sits at the highest level since 2009. While sentiment remains above its mid-2022 lows, this abrupt downturn in early 2025 marks a sharp reversal from gains in more recent years — and a sign that American households are bracing for more economic turbulence ahead. Recent warnings from top executives underscore the public’s growing unease. Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy said new tariffs are already prompting many third-party sellers to raise prices and driving shoppers to stockpile. Amazon is trying to soften the blow by stockpiling inventory and renegotiating supplier terms, but Jassy acknowledged that inflationary pressures are likely to ripple through the platform. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the economy is facing “considerable turbulence,” highlighting risks from “sticky inflation,” high fiscal deficits, elevated asset prices, and escalating “tariffs and ‘trade wars.’” Appearing on CNBC (CMCSA) Friday, BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s sentiments, saying that he expects a “slowdown” across the board, and that the U.S. may be in a recession soon — if it isn’t already.

Title: BlackRock’s crypto ETFs thrive in one of the toughest quarters with $3 billion inflow

BlackRock's crypto ETFs capture investor interest amid Bitcoin and Ethereum volatility. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, reported $3 billion in digital asset inflows during the first quarter of 2025 despite the volatility in the crypto market. The update came in the firm’s latest earnings report, which also revealed $84 billion in total net flows across its broader portfolio during the quarter. The performance was primarily fueled by record-breaking activity in BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which brought in $107 billion in net flows alone. Additional gains came from private markets and systematic active strategies, reflecting strong investor confidence in the firm’s broader offerings. Commenting on the results, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the quarter as the firm’s best start to a year since 2021. Fink added: “We delivered 6% organic base fee growth in the first quarter, representing our best start to a year since 2021 and secular strength against a complex market backdrop. We are helping clients navigate market and policy changes, while also providing insights on long-term structural growth opportunities.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs comprised around 2.8% of total Q1 inflows. While that share remains modest, it’s significant given the market turbulence in early 2025. Bitcoin and Ethereum faced steep corrections, marking one of their most challenging quarters in recent memory. Despite the volatility, BlackRock’s crypto-related products played a pivotal role in what many analysts have called the most successful ETF rollout in financial history. The firm’s digital asset offerings have driven billions in liquidity to the crypto market, helping to soften the usual capital rotation cycles that dominate the space. As a result, the firm has begun expanding its crypto-related product offerings to other regions, including Canada and Europe. However, digital assets remain a relatively small part of BlackRock’s broader portfolio despite the momentum. As of March 31, 2025, the firm’s digital asset ETFs held $50.3 billion under management, just 0.5% of its total $11.6 trillion portfolio. These assets generated $34 million in base fees over the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s grim recession warning: Trump tariffs ‘beyond anything I could have imagined’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/11/business/larry-fink-says-trump-tariffs-beyond-anything-i-could-have-imagined/

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Friday he was blindsided by the scope of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs — and joined other Wall Street bigwigs in warning that a trade war could push the economy into recession. “The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink told analysts on a conference call following BlackRock’s first-quarter earnings release. “This isn’t Wall Street versus Main Street. The market downturn impacts millions of ordinary people’s retirement savings.” Fink also expressed concern about the broader economic outlook, telling CNBC that he believes the US may already be in a recession. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” he said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” Trump’s decision on April 2 to impose the most severe tariffs in over a century triggered a global sell-off. The S&P 500 Index suffered its steepest two-day drop since the COVID-19 market crash in March 2020, plunging sharply on April 3 and 4. While the president moved to ease tensions with a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs Wednesday, he maintained a firm stance on China — imposing a 145% levy on Chinese imports and keeping 10% tariffs on most other countries. China retaliated early Friday morning by announcing that it was raising its own tariffs on US imports to 125%. While Trump’s temporary tariff pause could buy time, it did little to alleviate deeper investor concerns, according to Fink. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. And we now have a 90-day on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty.” Fink noted that signs of a slowdown are already surfacing, even as headline economic data such as job growth and retail spending remain relatively strong. He suggested that consumer stockpiling ahead of the tariffs may be obscuring underlying fragility in demand. “In the short run, we have an economy that is at risk,” he said. Despite the near-term turbulence, Fink emphasized that longer-term investment opportunities remain, such as the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and growing demand for infrastructure. He also suggested that investors may begin shifting capital toward Europe as conditions in the US remain volatile. At a separate Economic Club of New York event earlier in the week, Fink remarked that many CEOs share his concern about the country’s economic direction. “Other CEOs also think the US is probably in a recession,” he said. BlackRock’s latest quarterly results underscored the uncertainty. The nation’s largest asset management firm reported adjusted earnings per share of $11.30 for the first quarter, topping analysts’ expectations of $10.14, according to LSEG. However, revenue came in at $5.28 billion, falling short of the $5.34 billion forecast. The firm attracted $84 billion in net inflows for the quarter and closed March with nearly $11.6 trillion in assets under management. Fink said that rising inflation and market volatility have led clients to park nearly $950 billion in cash at BlackRock, a record amount. “That money will eventually be deployed,” he said, “but for now, clients are waiting.” Shares of BlackRock rose slightly in early Friday trading. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon echoed Fink’s sentiments on Friday, warning the US economy is facing “considerable turbulence” from Trump’s threats to start a global trade war. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and ‘trade wars’, ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,” Dimon said.

Title: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets

Time Published: 2025-04-11T15:15:58Z

Highlights Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is quietly transforming capital markets, enabling greater efficiency, liquidity and automation through blockchain technology. RWAs offer CFOs and treasurers practical benefits over speculative crypto assets, including yield generation, liquidity management and collateralization, by anchoring digital tokens to tangible or cash-flow-generating assets. Despite growing interest, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle, with industry leaders and lawmakers recognizing the need for clearer frameworks to enable broader adoption of tokenized financial instruments. Blockchain technology was meant to disrupt payments and finance. But while the payments space, at least in the U.S., remains in waiting for a crypto-led transformation, it is across capital markets where traditional approaches are already undergoing a quiet on-chain revolution thanks to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). With the news this week that private equity and insurance giant Apollo has made a strategic investment in Plume, a blockchain platform focused on RWAs, boardrooms and treasury offices are now paying closer attention to efficiencies gained by turning real-world assets into digital ones through tokenization. The Plume investment follows Apollo’s January partnership with RWA infrastructure provider Securitize to tokenize investment opportunities. As digital transformation reshapes capital markets, RWAs represent a potent convergence of blockchain technology and traditional finance. For chief financial officers (CFOs) and corporate treasurers charged with steering balance sheets, optimizing liquidity and mitigating risk, RWAs could offer both compelling opportunities as well as new layers of complexity. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which derive their value from consensus and scarcity, RWAs are anchored in real-world value and can often generate cash flow. For CFOs, this shift signals a move from speculative digital assets toward instruments that might be able to play tangible roles in liquidity management, yield generation and even collateralization strategies. Read also: Need for On-Chain Trust Grows as AI Agents Flood Crypto Real-world assets are tangible or intangible assets — such as U.S. Treasuries, real estate, invoices, carbon credits, securities or even art — that have been tokenized and placed on a blockchain. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token that represents ownership or a claim on an underlying asset. These digital representations are often embedded with smart contracts that automate compliance, yield disbursements and governance functions. Once these assets are tokenized, organizations and enterprises can take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains which can reduce transaction fees, streamline settlement times and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets makes them easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets. Major financial players, and not just Apollo, are taking RWAs seriously. BlackRock recently launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by short-term U.S. Treasurys. JPMorgan’s Onyx platform has already settled billions in tokenized collateral transfers, while Citigroup partnered with Wellington Management and WisdomTree to explore the tokenization of private markets. Earlier this year, it was also announced that Ondo Finance would be the first provider to bring real-world assets to Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN). “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” For CFOs and treasurers responsible for safeguarding corporate capital and ensuring optimal deployment, RWAs present novel use cases across several financial disciplines. See also: Stablecoin Sandwiches? Here’s What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon Digital asset fluency is quickly becoming a core competency for finance teams. The blockchain can offer CFOs and treasurers a powerful toolkit, but, like all advanced technologies, it is one that must be wielded with precision and foresight. PYMNTS Intelligence this year found that blockchain technology has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of regulated industries, including finance, healthcare, identity verification and supply chain management, to name a few. But holding tokenized assets requires secure digital custody solutions. Custodians must be vetted not only for cybersecurity but also for their legal and compliance frameworks. Additionally, many RWA platforms still rely on centralized issuers who can pose operational or credit risk. Among the biggest uncertainty impacting the RWA space, just as with the rest of the on-chain economy, is the lack of operational clarity around regulation in the U.S. marketplace. But the tide is beginning to turn. “The largest financial institutions are eager to explore tokenized assets,” Nikola Plecas, head of commercialization, Visa Crypto, told PYMNTS, but added that they require regulatory certainty to do so at scale. PYMNTS covered Wednesday (April 9) how crypto industry participants and attorneys told a House subcommittee that existing regulations from the SEC lack clarity and are outdated, while the lawmakers in attendance said new legislation tied to market structure and oversight would be forthcoming.

Title: Larry Fink says Trump's tariffs 'went further than I could have imagined'

Even people who make a living from predicting the markets can’t predict everything. Larry Fink, the longtime CEO of BlackRock (BLK), said on a Friday call with analysts that he was surprised by President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs last week. “The sweeping U.S. tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink said on a call after the company reported first-quarter financial results. On April 2, the president imposed the steepest tariffs the country has seen in over a century — a 10% universal tariff and heavy reciprocal tariffs. This week, Trump announced a 90-day reciprocal tariff pause on countries that hadn’t announced retaliatory duties. Tariffs on China, notably, remain in place; the country is now facing a 145% reciprocal tariff; China has since announced a 125% levy on all U.S. goods. The markets have been chaotic this month — after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, the S&P 500 had its steepest two-day plunge since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 90-day pause on tariffs sent the markets skyrocketing before coming back down to Earth. Now, the markets continue to grapple with what the future could look like: What the steep tariffs on China mean for Big Tech, whether the president will continue to be erratic with his trade policy, whether the country is headed for a recession, and more. “In the short run, we have an economy that is at risk,” Fink said, before adding that artificial intelligence and rising infrastructure demand present significant and “transformative” investment opportunities. “This isn’t Wall Street versus Main Street,” he said. “The market downturn impacts millions of ordinary people’s retirement savings.” This morning, BlackRock announced better-than-expected first-quarter results — revenue rising 12% to $5.28 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $11.30, beating analyst expectations of $10.19. Fink, who has become a billionaire through his role at the helm of the world’s largest asset manager, went on CNBC’s (CMCSA) Squawk on the Street on Friday morning to issue a more dire warning about the days ahead. “I think we’re very close (to), if not in, a recession now,” he said. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. … We now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty.” Fink said the current economic crisis “is not a pandemic, this is not a financial crisis, this is something that we have created.” He added that the U.S. is now a “global destabilizer.” His comments Friday echo what he said earlier this week: that the U.S. is headed for a global slowdown and that the country’s economy is “weakening as we speak.” Fink told CNBC, “Long term, I’m less worried about some of these issues, but in the short run, I’m petrified about some of these issues.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin and Ether ETF Inflows Declined 83% in Q1 to $3B

Full Content:
In no surprise given the lame crypto price action in the first quarter of 2025, BlackRock (BLK) posted a sizable slump in net inflows into its spot bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) ETFs. In all, investors put $3 billion into BlackRock’s digital asset-focused ETFs in the first three months of the year, according to the company's first quarter earning report. That's an 83% drop from what was a big inflow number in the fourth quarter as prices and sentiment shot higher alongside the Trump election victory. Taken alone, the first quarter number still signals strong demand for crypto-linked funds, even as prices deteriorated. That $3 billion represents 2.8% of the total inflows into BlackRock’s mammoth iShares ETFs in the first quarter, which also include active, core equity, and strategic funds, among smaller categories. BlackRock at quarter's end managed roughly $50.3 billion in digital assets, or about 0.5% of its total assets of more than $10 trillion. Digital asset ETFs accounted for $34 million in base fees, or less than 1% of the company’s long-term revenue. The decline in bitcoin and ether ETF inflows last quarter came alongside a 70% quarterly fall in iShares' overall inflows to $84 billion from $281 million as global markets attempted to navigate the changing macroeconomic environment under President Trump.

Title: BNY Is Changing The Game For Crypto Accounting
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/11/bny-is-changing-the-game-for-crypto-accounting/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T14:19:04Z

BySean Stein Smith BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. BNY continues to expand crypto operations In the latest move by TradFi institutions pivoting to embrace the blockchain and tokenized asset space, the banking giant BNY has debuted a real-time reporting tool (Digital Assets Data Insights) in partnership with Blackrock. The fact that these two financial giants are collaborating on an on-chain valuation and reporting tool is set to have substantial effects on the crypto accounting and reporting conversation moving forward. Put simply, this tool will allow the posting of net-asset-value data directly on to select blockchains without relying on third-party accounting services. The involvement of on-chain money market fund, BUIDL, managed by Blackrock in addition to being the leading partner on this initiative, also highlights the growing importance of on-chain assets. Benefits that have been discussed connected to this include 1) the ability of BNY to post NAV figures directly on chain, 2) enhanced credibility of tokenized funds thanks to increased transparency and real-time information, and 3) the ability of other products to benefit from more comprehensive suites of tools tailor made for tokenized information. The launch of the partnership also reinforces the rise of tokenized assets and other data, outside of traditionally decentralized instruments such as bitcoin and ether. While the project itself is still in early stages the implications of this real-time reporting and disclosure capability are significant in terms of allowing further maturation of tradeable products and services. In addition the reporting functionality of Digital Assets Data Insights will have implications for the crypto accounting world; let’s take a look at a few of them. One of the key aspects of BNY’s efforts is the connection that will be established between on-chain assets and off-chain data across blockchain networks. Specifically, and leveraging the data already managed on-chain by BNY, the institution will be able to broadcast select accounting data to the Ethereum network, amplifying the ability of investors to leverage public blockchain traceability and transparency. By also integrating smart contract functionality, customers will be able to automate data analytics and better integrate off-chain data and information alongside how public blockchains are used. In short the efforts underway at BNY have the potential to unlock better transparency, traceability, and insights for tokenized products whether or not said instruments are stored on-chain or secured via off-chain mechanisms. These values of tokenized funds being posted directly on-chain also have the potential to accelerate conversations related to accounting, reporting, and disclosures. An ongoing issue in the crypto and tokenized asset sector is the lack of standardized reporting and disclosures in the marketplace. While multiple private sector options have been put forward as potential options the reality is that there are still open items when it comes to critical accounting issues. These include not are limited to how to best determine valuation and liquidity measures for certain specific cryptoassets, products, or instruments and the consistency with which these pieces of information are reported to the marketplace. Accounting professionals will need to be aware of how these non-CPA generated reporting frameworks and best practices will influence client expectations going forward. Obtaining more accurate and real-time data linked to the valuation of crypto instruments and investing options will also enable the increased proliferation of dashboards, KPIs, credit scores, and other data that is essential for widely traded investing products and services. One additional aspect of these changes is the impact and acceleration that more real-time data will have on a particularly tricky crypto accounting area; crypto-audits. The singular aspect of the cryptoasset landscape that has continued to lag behind the landscape at large, even as institutional adoption continues to accelerate is the development and proliferation of standardized crypto audit practices. With the FASB and IASB only having issued limited guidance to this point, and tax agencies taking varied approaches to crypto tax issues, the onus has fallen on the private sector to develop such practices. For example, the AICPA has developed and continued to update multiple practice aids related to accounting and attestation best practices for digital assets. In addition the Digital Chamber of Commerce has also issued multiple whitepapers on the topic of proof-of-reserves, and although that practice continues to evolve the expectation is that some iteration of this concept will play a key role going forward. The efforts by BNY to enable more real-time valuation and (by extension) reporting and disclosure will only increase the appetite and interest in these ideas. As TradFi continues to adopt crypto, some of the largest institutions are looking to shake up the crypto accounting landscape.

Title: BlackRock CEO says U.S. may be in a recession now

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy has weakened to the point of growth possibly turning negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on “Squawk on the Street.” Fears of an economic slowdown have risen sharply since President Donald Trump unveiled widespread tariffs last week, sparking a sell-off in the stock market. Trump on Wednesday announced that he was pausing some of those import levies for 90 days, but that move is not enough to restore confidence in the economy, Fink said. “I think you’re going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there’s more certainty. And we now have a 90-day on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty,” Fink said Friday. Surveys of consumers and business leaders have shown weakening sentiment in recent months. However, other pieces of economic data like job growth and retail sales have held up better. Fink said consumers may have been stock up on goods ahead of the threatened tariffs, which could be masking some underlying economic weakness. Fink’s comments come after BlackRock released its first-quarter financial results. In that release, the CEO commented that “uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations.” The asset management giant’s financial results were mixed. BlackRock reported $11.30 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, above the $10.14 expected by Wall Street analysts, according to LSEG. However, $5.28 billion in revenue was short of the $5.34 billion consensus expectations. On the assets front, BlackRock reported $84 billion in net inflows during the quarter and ended March with nearly $11.6 trillion under management. Shares of the firm were up less than 1% in morning trading. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: BlackRock draws $3 billion in digital asset inflows in Q1, AUM reaches $11.6 trillion

Share this article Investors poured around $3 billion into BlackRock’s digital asset products in Q1 2025, contributing to $84 billion in total net inflows for the quarter, according to the firm’s first-quarter earnings release on April 11. BlackRock’s iShares ETF platform brought in a strong $107 billion in net inflows during Q1 2025. However, the firm’s total net inflows came in lower at $84 billion, as outflows in other segments—notably a $45.5 billion pullback from institutional index funds—offset the ETF gains. BlackRock’s digital assets under management stood at over $50 billion at the end of Q1, up from $17.5 billion a year ago, which represents a 187% increase year-over-year. This surge dwarfed the growth rate of other asset classes within the firm’s portfolio, such as equities, which was up 8% YoY to $5.7 trillion. The first quarter also brought notable volatility. Even though digital assets attracted over $3 billion in net inflows, market depreciation reduced their value by over $8 billion. As of March 31, the global asset manager oversees approximately $11.6 trillion worth of client assets. Digital assets make up just 1% of BlackRock’s total AUM, with their $3 billion net inflows accounting for 2.8% of total ETF inflows in Q1 2025. For comparison, private market investments brought in $9.3 billion during the same period. Digital asset-related investment advisory and admin fees reached $34 million in Q1, less than 1% of BlackRock’s total $4.1 billion in long-term revenue as of March 31. That figure aligns with the segment’s AUM share but underscores the low-fee structure typical of digital offerings. For example, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), BlackRock’s flagship crypto ETF launched in early 2024, operates at a competitive 0.25% fee post-waiver. The report comes as US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their sixth straight day of net outflows, with $149 million in redemptions yesterday, according to Farside Investors. The withdrawals were led by Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, amidst a broader market movement where investors sought safer assets such as gold and cash, influenced by escalating US-China tariff disputes and market volatility tied to US policy changes.

Title: Ireland women to get true test of their progress
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/11/ireland-women-to-get-true-test-of-their-progress/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T13:52:41Z

This afternoon in Cork, Ireland will discover if there is any lingering scar tissue from last year’s 88-10 shellacking at Twickenham. Scott Bemand’s Ireland team have made significant progress in the interim, including a brilliant victory over New Zealand in Canada last November. England, chasing a 32nd successive Six Nations victory dating back to when Ireland were the last side to beat them in 2018, remain the benchmark by which all teams are weighed and measured. John Mitchell’s side show no signs of growing bored or tired of their dominance and will be keen to continue to crush all comers ahead of a home World Cup later in the year. Under Bemand and his coaching team, the influx and influence of the Sevens cohort has helped to produce a more blended style in attack and defence l and there has been an improvement at set-piece and breakdown. England are about to test that warranty. Ireland’s reserve hooker Clíodhna Moloney has first-hand knowledge of the basement level issues that undermined Irish women’s rugby over the years and also the current trajectory that has seen the national side climb steadily in performance and ranking. Her appraisal is worth noting. “A lot has changed in terms of our experiences as a group, our playing group has changed, new people have come in. You’ve got the likes of Erin King coming in and performing really well in Vancouver. “A lot of other players have come in and come through the Celtic Challenge and other pathways. I think it’s just growing all the time. We’ve obviously got a new coaching staff. Areas of our game continue to develop like lineout, set-piece, Hugh Hogan has been brilliant on defence. “Our set-piece has grown from a coaching perspective but also from a player’s expectation. When we train (in) units, the detail that the girls are operating at weekly, it’s advancing all the time. And that expectation is very high in the group. “The physicality is going up a lot. The ball in play, we’re trying to push that. We’re trying to play quickly, trying to play on top of teams. And you feel it in your body, and you feel it in the intensity after sessions. “We’re trying to diversify our attack as well. It’s a multifaceted piece. I think a lot has changed and people have learned a lot, that [the England game last year] was probably the biggest game they’d experienced ever for this group. That will never happen again, I think we’d all say that. “People are happy and excited after it rather than worrying or looking back. They want more. That’s probably the biggest thing with this group is that you’ve got girls being like, ‘okay what’s the next thing’?” Moloney’s time in England with the Exeter Chiefs gives her an obvious insight into England’s depth of quality in terms of the playing roster but she doesn’t feel the need to tell any ghost stories. Her team-mates know what’s coming and are keen to embrace the challenge. “I don’t think you need to tell them. It’s more of a feeling of knowing that we’ve done the work, experiencing how training feels when we’re under really high-pressure scenarios. It’s that that gives them confidence more than me telling them this or that about whatever player I might know. “The have confidence from the pressure we’ve experienced here. I think they’re just really excited to be honest with you. There’s no fear in there.” And the truth in that statement will be borne out by what happens this afternoon during the 80-minutes. Ireland must have the courage and belief to play and let that take them where it will on the scoreboard.

Friday’s premarket futures point to a modestly positive open after Thursday’s steep sell-off, with the S&P 500 edging up 0.2%, the Dow gaining 0.2%, and the Nasdaq rising 0.1%. In premarket news, big-name financials including BlackRock (BLK), JPMorgan (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS) posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter results, offering a glimpse into how Wall Street is weathering the latest round of economic uncertainty. But behind the headline numbers, executives struck a noticeably cautious tone. BlackRock reported top-line growth, with revenue rising 12% to $5.28 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $11.30, beating analyst expectations of $10.19. Net inflows surged to a record $84 billion, led by iShares ETFs, and total assets under management climbed to $11.58 trillion. Shares were flat in premarket trading. Morgan Stanley also turned in a strong performance, with net revenues of $17.7 billion, up from $15.1 billion a year earlier. The bank beat earnings-per-share estimates and highlighted robust momentum across trading, wealth management, and other segments. Shares rose 0.5% early in the morning but declined 2% just before the market open. JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter earnings of $5.07 per share on revenue of $46.01 billion, topping analyst expectations as profit rose 9% to $14.64 billion. Excluding a one-time gain from the bank’s First Republic acquisition, adjusted EPS came in at $4.91, still beating estimates, with strong performances in trading, investment banking, and asset management driving the upside. Shares climbed over 1% in early trading but sank into the red as the bell neared. In his comments, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon offered little room for celebration. In a statement, he warned the economy faces “considerable turbulence,” citing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits, inflated asset prices, and an escalating wave of “tariffs and ‘trade wars.’” “The potential positives of tax reform and deregulation are being offset by significant negatives,” Dimon said. In other words, Wall Street’s balance sheets may still look strong, but its crystal ball is getting cloudier by the day.

* Banks warn tariffs could slow economic growth * Executives highlight consumer and corporate caution amid tariff uncertainty * Banks report record revenue from stock trading By Nupur Anand, Saeed Azhar and Tatiana Bautzer NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Profits at major U.S. banks beat forecasts in the first quarter as stock trading jumped, but executives warned on Friday that sweeping tariffs could fuel risks and weigh on economic growth. Equity traders at JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley brought in record revenue as markets boomed at the start of the year, while Wells Fargo earned more fees from clients. But industry executives said consumers and corporations were becoming more cautious about U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have roiled markets and could spur inflation and tip the economy into recession. "Attention is now shifting to the storm clouds of tariff uncertainty," said Peter Torrente, a banking sector leader at KPMG in the U.S. "The magnifying glass is hovering now over fiscal policy and credit risk. The health of consumers’ finances is being carefully observed, as tariffs could lead to higher prices, impacting their loan repayment capability ... Monitoring loan demand from companies will also be an important area to watch." While it is too early to understand the full implications of the tariffs, households and businesses were starting to respond to the import levies, executives at the biggest U.S. lenders said. "You're starting to see maybe a little bit of pivoting from consumers pre-buying stuff that might be getting more expensive," Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, told reporters. Corporate clients are in a wait-and-see mode, because "this level of policy uncertainty is one that makes it hard to plan for the long term." Corporations that are set to report their results in the upcoming weeks will probably withdraw their earnings forecasts given the uncertainty, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts. The latest warnings add to a chorus of Wall Street executives ringing alarm bells about the potential economic damage from the tariffs, including Dimon, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman. Investors hoping for an end to wild market swings were reminded with Thursday's stock-market plunge that shifting tariff plans remain a threat to earnings and the economy. Corporate and commercial banking clients "are taking a step back saying, 'you know, I need to get more clarity, certainty about where things are going,'" Wells Fargo CFO Michael Santomassimo told journalists.

Title: Gold is a better bet than Treasurys to weather the market storm, says BlackRock strategist

Gold hit another record high above $3,200 on Friday — and is a better way to protect against the ongoing market turmoil than Treasury bills, a BlackRock executive said. Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at the asset manager, wrote in a LinkedIn post on Thursday that higher exchange rates and "currency down" were abnormal. "Also not normal — risk off, #dollar and Treasuries down. I will keep saying it: #gold is a better diversifier than Treasuries in this environment of high debt." Fears over the longer-term effects of President Donald Trump's trade tariffs have triggered an aggressive sell-off of US bonds. Yields have continued to rise this week, with the 10-year Treasury yield up almost 4.4% on Friday. Treasurys have traditionally been considered one of the safest investments available, but that perception may be starting to change. The dollar has also suffered amid the turmoil, hitting a three-year low against the euro and a 10-year low against the Swiss franc. "In this new regime characterized by 1/ #inflationary pressure and 2/ high #debt, gold has been and could continue to be a better diversifier than long-duration Treasuries," Li wrote in an earlier LinkedIn post. Last month gold broke through the $3,000 level for the first time. In the days following Trump's tariff announcement on April 2, the metal went as high as about $3,150 before retreating. Gold has since regained momentum as investors seek out safe-haven assets, which typically maintain or increase their value during market turbulence. In a Friday note, UBS analysts raised their 2025 gold price target to $3,500, citing "escalating tariff uncertainty, weaker growth, higher inflation and lingering geopolitical risks." "Gold seems to be unfazed by higher US yields," they wrote, adding that the metal has stood out this year compared with other safe havens including Treasurys, the franc, and the yen. Analysts at Bank of America also have a price target of $3,500 for gold. Get the latest Gold price here. Jump to

Title: BlackRock's Larry Fink has a global and 'optimistic' worldview even as Trump upends international trade

BlackRock's first client 37 years ago was Japanese. A majority of the $11. 6 trillion New York-based firm's employees are based internationally. The manager's risk platform Aladdin just signed its first Korean client. There are even plans to open a few more offices outside the US where the world's largest asset manager has a client base, CEO Larry Fink said Friday morning. "BlackRock is a global firm, but one that operates hyper-locally," he said. In practice, this means "we are Mexican in Mexico, Canadian in Canada," among other countries and nationalities, Fink said. It was a notable remark from the world's largest asset manager, which held its first-quarter earnings call Friday morning as the financial world struggles to digest the ramifications of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Though the tariffs have been put on pause for most countries, though notably not China, Fink said that "in the short run, we have an economy at risk." This follows his talk Monday at the Economic Club of New York when Fink said that most of the CEOs he is talking to "would say we are probably in a recession right now." In the firm's earnings release, the current market environment is compared to "large, structural shifts" that occurred during the financial crisis and COVID-19. Despite the dire immediate backdrop, Fink said his firm leads with "optimism." The large macro trends — such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure spending that BlackRock has focused on for the next wave of its growth — "are still around," he said, and that the manager has a "growth mindset." Over recent weeks, BlackRock has had thousands of client conversations, Fink said, and there's still a significant appetite for infrastructure investing. He said BlackRock preaches long-term solutions, not moves to address "the next tweet." He said the public market chaos is expected to attract more assets to private markets, a shift the firm is embracing. Still, the tariffs — which Fink said "went beyond anything I could have imagined" — cannot be ignored as simply short-term noise. BlackRock's European ETF line surpassed $1 trillion in assets for the first time last quarter, thanks to investors leaving the US. Retirement and college savings are hit by such severe dips in stock markets. "This isn't Wall Street versus Main Street," Fink said in his prepared remarks to start the call. His closing advice (or wish): "Have a calm second quarter." Jump to

Title: Stocks tick back up as trade tensions deepen and big banks report earnings

U.S. stocks rose sharply Friday afternoon to close out a historically turbulent week, as investors absorbed rising trade tensions, falling consumer confidence numbers, and a wave of major bank earnings. After a turbulent Thursday that saw major U.S. market indexes sink sharply, the Dow Jones Industrial Average concluded the day up 619 points, or about 1.5%. The S&P 500 added 1.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose almost 2.1%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) finished Friday up 4% after the bank reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue. BlackRock (BLK) gained 2.6% following its own earnings beat, while Morgan Stanley (MS) shares rose 1.4% following strong performance across its major business lines. Wells Fargo (WFC) slipped almost 1%, underperforming its peers. Big Tech names also posted gains. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ended up 2.6%, Microsoft (MSFT) gained 1.9%, and Apple (AAPL) rose 4.1%. The gains suggested that while concerns over tariffs and political volatility remain top of mind, corporate results — especially from key financial players — are offering some reassurance to investors as earnings season kicks off. However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the economy is facing “considerable turbulence,” highlighting risks from “sticky inflation,” high fiscal deficits, elevated asset prices, and escalating “tariffs and ‘trade wars.’” He pointed to analysts’ revised earnings estimates for the S&P 500 as a possible sign of pain to come. Appearing on CNBC (CMCSA) Friday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s sentiments, saying that he expects a “slowdown” across the board and that the U.S. may be in a recession soon — if it isn’t already. And U.S. consumers are growing deeply uneasy. According to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment has declined 11% since March. This marks the fourth consecutive monthly decline and a 30% decrease since December 2024. Overnight, China announced a steep escalation in its trade retaliation, raising tariffs on U.S. imports from 84% to 125%. Chinese officials said the new rates effectively render U.S. goods uncompetitive — and that any further tariff increases from Washington would be treated as economically irrelevant. Meanwhile, gold surged to a record high above $3,200 an ounce as the bond selloff resumed and investors fled U.S. assets. Long-dated Treasury yields spiked again, signaling persistent fears over inflation and policy volatility. The U.S. dollar also slid, with the ICE Dollar Index down more than 1% to its lowest level in nearly three years. Deutsche Bank (DB) analysts quoted by the New York Times cited the “radical vision and volatile policy” of the Trump administration as a major reason for the depreciation of key U.S. assets. Consumer-facing companies are also beginning to warn of downstream effects. Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy said the newly announced tariffs are already prompting third-party sellers to raise prices and consumers to stockpile. While Amazon is trying to soften the blow by stockpiling inventory and renegotiating with suppliers, Jassy acknowledged inflationary pressures are likely to ripple through. Meanwhile, the political climate may be adding its own chill. JPMorgan Chase strategist Michael Cembalest revealed this week that he has begun softening his public commentary on tariffs, citing the tense environment and recent executive orders targeting firms and individuals associated with Trump-era investigations. Other analysts are speaking out, however, with Wedbush releasing a memo Friday morning that didn’t mince words. “The economic tariff Armageddon unleashed by Trump last week has been the dark black cloud over stocks since this fiasco began and so far it’s been a Wall Street/stock driven event...that is all about to change over the coming days and weeks for U.S. consumers and businesses with the China 145% tariff now in place,” the memo said. “The self-inflicted uncertainty from the China tariffs has turned the corporate capital expenditures world upside down, created mass uncertainty not seen since Covid, created a price shock that will impact the daily lives of U.S. consumers with no end in sight, and unfortunately ripped the hearts and lungs out of the U.S. Big Tech supply chain in the process with no minimal to no alternatives.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has reported a slowdown in inflows after two record quarters, as the sell-off in financial markets weighed on investor confidence. The New York-headquartered group said it attracted $84 billion (€74 billion) in the three months to March, down from $281 billion (€248 billion) in the final quarter of 2024 and lower than Wall Street estimates. The new money boosted its assets under management to $11.6 trillion. Full-year profits fell 4 per cent on the previous year to $1.5 billion, or $9.64 per share, both short of analysts’ expectations. The company said the decline was linked to expenses from its acquisition spree last year, when BlackRock struck $30 billion of deals as chief executive Larry Fink pushed the group deeper into private markets. Revenues rose 12 per cent from a year ago to $5.3 billion, bolstered by its takeover of infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners and growth in its exchange traded fund business. “Uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations,” Mr Fink said. “We’ve seen periods like this before when there were large, structural shifts in policy and markets — like the financial crisis, Covid and surging inflation in 2022.” He added: “Some of BlackRock’s biggest leaps in growth followed.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: US-China tariff hikes affect Polish container terminal sale
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/us-china-tariff-hikes-affect-polish-container-terminal-sale/a-72214420
Time Published: 2025-04-11T10:45:00Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump's push to curb China's sway in the Panama Canal led to talk of a US firm buying stakes in ports from a Chinese firm, including a container terminal in Poland. With tariffs escalating, will the sale go ahead? When the Gdynia Container Terminal (GCT) on Poland's Baltic coast was taken over by Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports in 2005 it was quickly dubbed Gdynkong — a portmanteau of Gdynia and Hong Kong. Twenty years on, Gdynkong is now caught in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Since his reelection last year, President Trump has repeatedly alleged Chinese interference in the Panama Canal and made it clear that he wants the US to "take back" the canal. On March 5, he announced that an agreement had been reached with CK Hutchison that the US investment firm BlackRock would purchase majority shares in CK Hutchison's Panama assets, including two ports at either end of the canal. As part of the deal, BlackRock would also buy 80% of approximately 40 assets in Hutchison's portfolio — one of which is the GCT in Poland. However, the discussion about the strategic importance of the Hutchison-controlled GCT in Poland long predates President Trump's push for greater control of the Panama Canal. The terminal and the port in general are important in their own right not only for Poland, but also for NATO and Ukraine. The GCT is located in the Port of Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. It is, therefore, on a main supply route from the West to Ukraine and close to infrastructure that is of strategic importance to both Poland and NATO. Indeed, the Polish government included the GCT on its list of critical infrastructure in 2024. Other entities in the Port of Gdynia include the Baltic Container Terminal, which is used by US forces and is just 150 meters from the GCT, the Polish Navy Special Forces base, the PGZ shipyard, where the new missile frigates for the Polish Navy are being built, and the main naval port for the Polish Navy, which is frequently visited by NATO ships. All this explains the GCT's major strategic relevance. However, there are also concerns about the terminal owner's ability to interfere with the port's accessibility in general. In August 2023, for example, equipment for the US Army was scheduled to be unloaded on a dock near the GCT. However, because the ship's bow protruded about 50 meters into the zone owned by Hutchison, the company refused to agree to the unloading. The unloading of the military equipment was unsuccessful. Eric Hontz, director of the Center for Accountable Investment at the Center for International Private Enterprise explains why this is so critical. Hontz says that were there to be an "accident" involving a commercial ship at the entrance to the port, much of the 3rd flotilla — the main strike force of the Polish Navy, whose main base is in the Port of Gdynia — would be stranded at port and, therefore, unable to assist in the event of Russian aggression. "These grey zone tactics blending commercial and security missions are now part and parcel of both Russian and Chinese tactics," Hontz told DW. But if the ports are of such importance — both economic and strategic — to China, why would Chinese firm Hutchison agree to sell so many of these assets? "CK Hutchison's decision to sell [an] 80% stake in 43 ports in 23 countries to a US-led consortium is not a sign of China's diminishing interest in controlling strategic ports in Europe and around the world. Instead, it appears to be a sign of a surprising disconnect between the Chinese government and the Hong Kong-based company," Maia Nikoladze, an associate director within the GeoEconomics Center, told DW. Hutchison leases the land on which the GCT stands, not from the Port of Gdynia but from the City of Gdynia. Thanks to a deal signed in 2007, Hutchison has an exceptionally cheap lease on the site until 2089. It pays just 294,000 zlotys (€68,000 or $75,700) a year, the City of Gdynia told the O2 news portal. "This is a story about how Poland lost control over a key part of the strategic NATO port in Gdynia," journalist Lukasz Rucinski, told DW. Rucinski, who has covered the evolving story for several years, says that Hutchison took advantage of legal loopholes and set up a special company in Luxembourg to allow it to gain control of land in the Port of Gdynia, making the terminal practically "extraterritorial." "It was a quiet process of handing over key infrastructure to the Chinese giant. Over the years, political decisions, strange arrangements and the lack of reaction from the state have meant that the Chinese have the final say. We also ask why they pay ridiculous amounts of money for perpetual usufruct [use and profit] of the port," Rucinski adds. But Gdynia is not the only port in Europe where Chinese companies are active. Hutchison has 53 terminals around the world, 13 of which are in Europe, including one each in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Poland, as well as five in the Netherlands and three in the UK. In 2023, the German government went ahead with a decision to sell 24.9% of a Hamburg port terminal to Chinese shipping company COSCO, despite security concerns and opposition from within the ruling coalition. For the moment, however, the sale of 80% of GCT to BlackRock is far from a done deal. The transaction would first need to clear a number of regulatory hurdles in every jurisdiction that would be impacted by the sale, ranging from standard merger-control clearances on competition grounds to security-focused investment screening procedures, says Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies (CEIAS) in Bratislava. "Any of the regulators may attach their conditions to the sale, which may impact how the deal looks in the end," he told DW. But quite apart from that, it is possible that the sale might not go ahead at all. The proposed sale of Hutchison assets to BlackRock drew heavy criticism from Chinese state-owned media and attracted the attention of China's State Administration for Market Regulation. Indeed Beijing has launched an antitrust review into the proposed acquisition by BlackRock of CK Hutchison' assets in the Panama Canal. However, President Trump's recent decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on imports from dozens of countries has also had an impact. After Trump announced a steep increase in tariffs on goods from China, China retaliated. Neither side seems to have any intention of backing down. Earlier this week, NBC reported that the sale of the two ports in the Panama Canal run by CK Hutchison was due to be signed last week, but was delayed following pressure from China. How this delay and the escalation in tariffs between China and the US will impact the sale of the GCT in Poland remains to be seen. Edited by: Aingeal Flanagan

Title: US stock futures little changed after China raises tariffs on US goods to 125%

U.S. stocks bounced back in early afternoon, helped by some dip-buying after a brief decline earlier on a weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment reading in the University of Michigan's preliminary April survey. The mid-month reading on sentiment fell to 50.8 from 57.0 in March and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 54.6. Inflation is becoming a major concern, according to the report, with expectation for inflation a year from now jumping to 6.7%, the highest level since November 1981 and up from 5% in March. Expectations for economic conditions also dropped 10.3% to 47.2, the lowest since May 1980. The drop in consumer sentiment has been alarming to some economists who say when consumers feel nervous and gloomy about the economy, they tend to close their wallets. Consumers make up about 70% of the economy, so a slowdown in consumer spending will take a toll on economic growth. That pressured stocks around mid-morning, but buyers emerged to buy the dip and pushed all three major indexes back in the green. Despite stocks' violent swings, all three major stock indexes are on pace for gains this week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace for their best weekly performance since November. "It’s been a challenging week, but also a moment to seek opportunities and not succumb to fear," said Mark Dowding, BlueBay chief investment officer at RBC Global Asset Management. Indeed, individual investors have been buying the dips throughout the downturn. On April 9, the day Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause, investing platform Wealthfront said it saw most money flowing into accounts in the early morning hours before the tariff pause was announced. Additionally, on April 8 when markets tanked, Wealthfront saw a significant increase in deposits into bond ladders, making it the highest single day for bond ladder deposits this year and signaling that some investors are taking advantage of rising Treasury yields. Bond ladders are created by buying bonds at varying maturities. Investors use them to provide a more predictable income stream and potentially reduce interest rate risk if rates move. If rates rise, investors won't be locked into a single bond with a lower rate. The blue-chip Dow rose 1.56%, or 618.99 points to 40,212.65; the S&P 500 added 1.81%, or 95.31 points, to 5,363.36; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2.06%, or 337.14 points, to 16,724.46. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 4.478%. Gold, seen as a safe asset during tumultuous times, rallied past $3,200 per ounce to set another record high early in the day. It was last up 2.23%. Overnight, China increased its tariff on U.S imports to 125% but signaled it wouldn't match anymore increases by the U.S. “Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it would be economically meaningless and would become a joke in the history of the world economy," China's finance ministry said. Despite those comments, the White House said Trump is "optimistic" China will seek a deal with the U.S. Meanwhile, the European Union said its trade representative would fly to Washington on Sunday to “try and sign deals," a sign a full-out global trade war may be averted. That sentiment helped stocks shortly after the open reverse a small part of Thursday's freefall, but money managers warn investors should remain cautious. Stocks swooned Thursday on fears President Donald Trump's triple-digit tariff on China would significantly damage the U.S. economy and corporate profits. Trump kept his 10% tariff on all countries but put reciprocal tariffs on hold for 90 days for all countries except China. Because China retaliated, Trump raised his tariff on Chinese goods to a total 145%. "While it was positive that most tariffs were lowered to 10%, the 145% tariff on China will still impair corporate profits," said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. "The $440 billion of goods the U.S. imported from China last year was second only to Mexico," he said. "Those low production-cost goods, whether they are technology, apparel, or materials, are important to corporate earnings. The auto and metals tariffs remain in place, and pharma and semiconductor tariffs are on deck. Exemptions may be coming, but they are not here yet." Wholesale prices in March unexpectedly fell 0.4%, posting the first decline since October 2023. The drop compares with February's 0.1% gain and economists' forecasts for a 0.2% rise. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, so-called core wholesale fell 0.1% against the estimate for a 0.3% increase. Wholesale prices are what businesses pay for their goods and services and sometimes seen as the first line for inflation to show up. This comes on the heesl of annual consumer inflation on Thursday showing a 2.4% rise in March, below economists' forecasts and February's 2.8%. It was the lowest annual increase since September. Still, some economists pointed out the inflation data are old, and "if tariffs stay in place, they will push inflation considerably higher in coming months," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. Comforting words, though, came from New York Federal Reserve President John Williams. Williams said the U.S. economy is not entering a period of high inflation and low growth, and the U.S. Federal Reserve will act to keep so-called "stagflation" at bay. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock kicked off earnings season. They provided the first glimpse into how businesses and consumers may be handling tariff volatility and how they see tariffs unfolding this year. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said his bank is "prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025, but the actual outcome will be dependent on the results and timing of the policy changes.” JP Morgan and Wells Fargo said they haven't seen a surge in companies tapping their credit lines. During times of stress and anxiety, companies grab cash from these credit lines to shore up financials, just in case. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said consumers also contninued to spend, though he said some may have been buying ahead of tariffs. Shares of JP Morgan closed up 4%; Wells Fargo fell almost 1 % after it lowered its full-year net interest income expectations; BlackRock rose 2.33%; and Morgan Stanley added 1.43%. Bitcoin rose back above the key $80,000 level, last up 5.23% at $83,756.51. Investors may watch to see if insiders sell any Trump digital tokens on April 17. Forty million of the tokens, recently worth more than $300 million, will be unlocked that day, meaning the owners of those tokens will be able to sell them for the first time since the Trump coin launched in January, according to the Trump cryptocurrency’s website. A company controlled by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is among the owners that will be able to sell, according to Trump’s 2024 public financial disclosure required for federal candidates.

New Hampshire's Bitcoin bill advances with strict asset guidelines while Florida sees rare bipartisan backing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Efforts to create state-owned Bitcoin reserves are gaining traction in the United States, with Florida and New Hampshire taking significant steps this week. On April 10, New Hampshire’s House of Representatives approved House Bill 302 (HB 302) with a narrow 192–179 vote. The bill passed the Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee earlier and moved to the state Senate for further deliberation. If that hurdle is cleared, it will go to Governor Kelly Ayotte for final approval. HB 302 gives the state treasurer authority to allocate up to 10% of state funds into a combination of digital assets and precious metals. However, it enforces strict guidelines. Only cryptocurrencies with a minimum market capitalization of $500 billion qualify for investment. Currently, Bitcoin is the only digital asset that meets this threshold. Meanwhile, the bill also outlines how the state should handle custody. Digital assets must be held directly by the state treasurer using secure storage, via a qualified custodian, or through a registered exchange-traded product. It further allows the treasurer to engage in lending or staking, provided the state retains legal ownership and uses an approved third-party solution. With this progress, New Hampshire becomes the fourth state to pass such legislation in one chamber, following Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas. Florida’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill HB487 has also made progress. The state’s Insurance and Banking Subcommittee unanimously approved it, clearing the way for further review on the House floor. This marks the first time a state SBR bill has passed a committee stage without opposition, signaling rare bipartisan support. Previously, most proposals of this nature have encountered resistance from Democrat lawmakers, primarily due to concerns about digital asset volatility and risk exposure. According to the bill, Bitcoin is considered a hedge against inflation by sovereign states and major institutional players, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. The legislation emphasizes the importance of giving the state access to tools like Bitcoin to help protect its finances from inflation. Representative Webster Barnaby, the bill’s sponsor, believes this move could position Florida as a leader in digital finance. The proposal also includes clear custody guidelines and allows investment either through direct purchase or regulated investment products. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal
URL: https://www.spacewar.com/reports/Panama_deal_allows_US_to_deploy_troops_to_canal_999.html
Time Published: 2025-04-11T09:38:03Z
Full Content:
The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and "other activities." The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught. But it gives the United States broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago. Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. - 'Country on fire' - Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable." He warned Hegseth: "Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire." In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty -- not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion -- and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little comfort to worried Panamanians. "What we have here is a setback to national sovereignty," Panamanian trade union leader Saul Mendez told AFP. "What the Panamanian government has done is an act of treason. They are traitors and must be tried." - Difficult history - The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega. That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital. Trump's vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations. By law, Panama operates the canal, giving access to all nations. But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal.

He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital.

Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable."

In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty -- not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion -- and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little comfort to worried Panamanians.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions.

Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

"What we have here is a setback to national sovereignty," Panamanian trade union leader Saul Mendez told AFP. "What the Panamanian government has done is an act of treason. They are traitors and must be tried." - Difficult history - The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride.

He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature."

However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

Title: Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal

Time Published: 2025-04-11T05:56:19Z
Full Content:
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, accompanied by Public Security Minister Frank Abrego, speaks during a press conference in Panama City, Wednesday, April 9, 2025. U.S. troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP Thursday, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway. The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows U.S. military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and "other activities." The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught. But it gives the United States broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago. Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of U.S. container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force — such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia — could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. 'Country on fire' Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that U.S. bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable." He warned Hegseth: "Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire." In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty — not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion — and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little comfort to worried Panamanians. "What we have here is a setback to national sovereignty," Panamanian trade union leader Saul Mendez told AFP. "What the Panamanian government has done is an act of treason. They are traitors and must be tried." Difficult history The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long U.S. occupation of the canal zone and U.S. invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega. That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital. Trump's vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations. By law, Panama operates the canal, giving access to all nations. But the U.S. president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries — including its two on the Panama Canal — to a consortium led by U.S. asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. US, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff wrapped up his latest talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Friday, after President Donald Trump urged his Russian counterpart to move quicker to end what he said was the country's "senseless war" with Ukraine. President Donald Trump insisted Friday that his tariff policy was "doing really well" despite China hiking levies on U.S. goods to 125 percent in the spiraling trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Jack Butland was the hero as Rangers held its nerve in a penalty shoot-out to dump Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahçe out of the Europa League and reach the quarterfinals on March 13 night.

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning A receiver has been appointed to a builder acting as the main contractor for an Ivan Yates-linked property development firm. Ian Curran has the story relating to Ingram Homes where the broadcaster and former Fine Gael minister is listed as a director and which is behind a large-scale housing scheme in Midleton, Co Cork. It understood to be replacing BPH Construction after it entered receivership this week. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was on a plane when Donald Trump unleashed his “Liberation Day” trade upheaval. Did he catch any of the live press conference? No, he tells Joe Brennan in an extensive interview, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t got a lot to say about it. Not long after Trump’s tariff U-turn, of sorts, the European Union (EU) moved to pause its retaliatory measures in the hope of building some goodwill. “We took note of the announcement by president Trump. We want to give negotiations a chance,” commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Nevertheless, as Jack Power reports from Brussels, uncertainty remains. Or as EU commissioner for industrial policy Stéphane Séjourné says, the “only certainty is that instability will remain for the next four years”. Meanwhile, it emerged that US tariffs levelled against China have now, in their entirety, reached 145 per cent. Denis Staunton is reporting from Beijing on the response there where officials say they are open to dialogue but only absent of threats. “China’s position is clear and consistent,” said spokesman He Yongqian, “…our door remains open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect.” Meanwhile, Arthur Beesley has a comprehensive explainer on everything that has happened, for now at least, and why. It’s hard to keep up with tariff news, given just how prone Donald Trump is to changing his mind. Not to mention the markets. There has been much made of what it all might mean for Ireland, given our close ties to US multinationals. In his column, John FitzGerald has a think about what the best responses might be from an EU point of view, and what the manufacturing of iPhones in Asia might mean for our coffers here. Much like tariffs, Dublin Airport’s efforts to lift its passenger cap rumbles on, although with little sign of imminent change. Peter Flanagan reports that there will be no restriction on slots for carriers this winter, with an ongoing legal challenge keeping the cap on hold. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has cleared additional slots for the upcoming winter season. US technology giant Workday has completed the deal to locate its new European HQ to College Square, the mammoth office scheme developed by Marlet Property Group on the old site of Apollo House in Dublin 2. The agreement, first reported on by The Irish Times, is a substantial office deal, and gives Workday’s staff the equivalent of five and a half football pitches. An Irish payroll manager who admitted “spying” on his own firm has escaped punishment for contempt of court. Keith O’Brien had faced the possibility of going to jail for contempt after destroying a phone he had been ordered to preserve. Rippling, a US-headquartered software provider brought High Court proceedings against its former employee claiming he had passed trade secrets to rival company Deel. Latest data shows headline inflation in the Irish economy reached to 2 per cent in March, for the first time since July 2024. That was up from an annualised inflation rate of 1.8 per cent. Ian Curran crunches the numbers which show restaurants, hotels and housing made the largest contribution.

Title: Market volatility order of the day as investors eye Trump’s next move

The unseasonably cold snap blasting much of North America is delaying the spring DIY sales boost toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker typically enjoys about this time of year. But the Connecticut-based maker of power screwdrivers to lawnmowers felt a harsher chill from Washington last week when Donald Trump unleashed tariffs on the rest of the world. Stanley Black & Decker may be better able to deal with the rapidly escalating trade war between the US and China than it would have been under Trump’s first presidency. “Seven, eight years ago, about 40 per cent of what we sold in the US came from China. And now we’re down to a number that’s closer to the mid-teens,” chief executive Don Allan told analysts on a call in January. It didn’t stop the company’s shares sliding 29 per cent over the course of 4½ days of trading following Trump’s April 2nd ‘Liberation Day’ speech. It made the toolmaker one of the worst affected stocks on the S&P 500 index as a violent wider market reaction wiped trillions off the value of shares globally and triggered gyrations across other financial markets. That was before the US president sensationally announced during lunchtime trading in New York on Wednesday (just after 6pm Irish time) that he would be putting a 90-day pause on most tariffs. Even though he has doubled down on China – levies on imports from there would rise to 125 per cent from 104 per cent after Beijing unveiled additional retaliatory charges earlier in the day – Stanley Black & Decker would not be denied participating in the biggest one-day Wall Street rebound since October 2008, jumping 15 per cent as the wider US market soared 9.5 per cent. [ White House says tariffs on China now total 145%Opens in new window ] While the relief rally spilled over into Asia and Europe on Thursday, selling pressure resumed as trading got under way again on Wall Street as markets waited for Trump’s next move. The market reaction seen for most of the past 10 days was “very different to anything we’d seen before”, said Aidan Donnelly, head of equities at Davy Private Clients. “Unlike, say, the financial crisis or Covid, this was self-inflicted.” Elliot Hentov, head of macro policy research at State Street Global Advisors, said stocks “would now require another positive trigger to take another leg up, while policy uncertainty continues to dominate market moves in coming weeks”. “The residual unknown would relate to whether US-China trade relations could improve within a reasonable time frame,” he said. The about-turn proved that Trump pays attention to the markets. But while the S&P 500 is usually the 78-year-old’s barometer of choice, it was the bond market that forced him to blink first in his game of chicken with what he had called “foreign scavengers”. Investors had initially piled into US government bonds – a traditional safe haven in times of market volatility – in the immediate aftermath of last week’s tariffs speech, sending the market interest rate – or yield – on its 10-year notes from about 4.2 per cent to below 4 per cent. However, the yield – which drives not only government borrowing costs but influences rates on new mortgages, credit card debt and business loans – spiked in the first three days of this week to as high as 4.5 per cent. This was an unusual move at a time when recession fears are mounting. It triggered a number of theories, ranging from investors dashing for cash to hedge funds being forced to sell to meet margin calls, and speculation that Chinese and Japanese investors – among the largest holders of US debt and worst impacted by Trump’s protectionist measures – were dumping US government bonds. Trump, who vowed over the weekend to maintain his hard line against the country’s trading partners even after stocks tanked, acknowledged on Wednesday evening the flashpoint that had spooked him most. [ US tariffs: Why Trump U-turned on his bombastic tariffs and what it means for IrelandOpens in new window ] “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it,” he told reporters. “I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.” His government needs to refinance trillions of dollars of debt in the next 12 months. The announcement of the 90-day moratorium suggests markets can probably eliminate worst-case scenarios, according to Barry Glavin, the Dublin-based head of global equities at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. “However, it also means that uncertainty will continue throughout this period,” he said. “It remains unclear what a steady-state looks like in terms of the tariff regime the US will stick with. It also remains to be seen what retaliatory measures will be implemented.” Trump’s major reversal will see tariffs on nations that don’t retaliate against the US drop to 10 per cent, which aligns with his blanket tariff level on all imports. Before this, most imports from the EU were facing a 20 per cent charge. EU member states had only approved 25 per cent counter-tariffs on a wide range of US products earlier on Wednesday, including poultry, soyabeans and steel. These were suspended on Thursday. The seven days that followed Trump whipping out his tariffs chart in the White House Rose Garden saw shares globally – measured by the MSCI World Index – slumping more than 11 per cent and Wall Street’s gauge of market fear, the Vix index, spiking at levels last seen five years ago during the height of the Covid panic. Banking stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off in Ireland – with Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB sliding between 14 and 18 per cent, amid concerns about the fallout on Ireland’s open economy. Only hours before his volte-face, Trump was threatening to soon announce “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which make up 60 per cent of Irish goods shipments across the Atlantic. In Dublin, too, the Central Bank upped its surveillance of Irish-domiciled funds holding €4.9 trillion of assets, making it the second-largest funds hub in Europe. [ EU hits pause on counter-tariffs in hope of US trade dealOpens in new window ] “Approximately €2.1 billion, or circa 43 per cent, of the total net assets of Irish domiciled investment funds are invested in global equities. The Central Bank has been closely monitoring data flows and engaging directly with various market participants in recent days, as is standard at times of heightened market volatility,” a spokeswoman for the regulator said. “We cannot comment on individual firms or the specifics of our supervisory engagements, but we continue to monitor for indicators of stress.” Over the seven days, the price of crude oil plunged by more than a fifth to less than $56 a barrel on recession fears; gold, a traditional go-to for investors in times of uncertainty, hit an all-time high of almost $3,168 an ounce before falling almost 7 per cent; and the premium that investors demand to hold debt of companies with low credit ratings, or junk bonds, spiralled at their fastest pace, relative to government debt, since the US regional banking crisis in March 2023. The cost of investors insuring against companies and sovereigns defaulting on debt on the credit default swaps market also moved higher. The turbulence was compounded by mixed messaging on the ultimate aim of the tariffs regime, with Trump and his treasury secretary Scott Bessent suggesting it would yield trade deals, while his top adviser on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, insisted there was no room for negotiation. Dissent also crept into the upper echelons of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. Elon Musk, head of Tesla and SpaceX, and Trump sidekick, distanced himself from the plan over the weekend when he suggested the US should enter a free-trade zone with Europe. He subsequently entered into a bitter public spat with Navarro, calling the protectionist former economics professor “a moron”. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a vocal backer of Trump’s presidential bid last year, urged the president to pause the tariffs, or risk “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter”. Ken Fisher, founder of Fisher Investments and a longtime Trump supporter since the 2016 campaign, went even further. He took to X on Tuesday to say the tariffs were “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools”. What Trump unveiled Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. Yet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish. Musk and the other six CEOs of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies that had led the wider market higher in recent years – including Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, all flag wavers at Trump’s inauguration in January – saw tens of billions wiped off their combined net wealth as the values of their companies fell. “Speedy ‘deal’ announcements over the coming 4-6 weeks would be the most favourable (or least negative) outcome for equity markets, in our view, and remain our base case,” said Deutsche Bank equity strategists, led by Maximilian Uleer, in a report published even before Trump announced his U-turn. If the US had stuck to the tariffs announced last week, Deutsche reckons it would have shaved as much as 1.5 percentage points off US gross domestic product (GDP) expansion this year – suggesting the economy would barely grow. It would only have been a matter of time before equity markets priced in a potential recession in Europe, too, they said. There is a threat that the US will return to its original tariffs plan once the 90-day pause is over, even though Trump – who sees himself as the ultimate dealmaker – has significantly weakened his hand by caving in to market forces. For now, a unilateral 10 per cent charge on most imports remains. “Right now, we don’t know who will pay for them,” said Ipek Ozkardeskava, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. “Will exporters absorb the majority of the costs to protect their US market share? Or will exporters pass on the costs to US consumers?” Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from US companies as the first-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday with banking giants JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo and investment group BlackRock reporting results and hosting analyst calls. While Davy’s Donnelly says market volatility may be the order of the day for the near term, he notes that investors with a long-term perspective have historically been well rewarded. The MSCI World Index’s 13 per cent decline so far this year compares to an almost 19 per cent advance over the course of 2024. The index is up by about 50 per cent from where it stood at the end of 2019. “In that period we’ve had a global pandemic, a massive swing in global interest rates and a trade dispute, and yet equities are up sharply,” said Donnelly. “If you were to be shown a chart in five years’ time depicting the performance of the stock market over 10 years, you probably wouldn’t be able to pick out [the current episode].” Joe Brennan is Markets Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How will US President Trump and Russia's Putin shape Germany foreign policy?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/german-social-democrats-and-conservatives-to-form-coalition-amid-global-chaos/a-72209474
Time Published: 2025-04-11T04:56:00Z
Full Content:
Germany's Social Democrats and Conservatives are eager to form a coalition amid the global economic and political uncertainty. The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have announced a coalition agreement, bringing Germany that much closer to forming a new government. It appears international friction and the recent tariff policies imposed by US President Donald Trump pushed negotiators to reach an agreement sooner, rather than later. Presenting the new agreement on Wednesday, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, likely to become the country's next chancellor, said Germany was currently facing a "situation of growing geopolitical tensions." The response of the coalition-in-waiting to these uncertain times, he said, was that "we want to, and we will, help shape change in the world, for Germany." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the SPD, added that "this is a turning point. We are living in truly historic times." When the new government takes office, expected it early May, it will be facing several important challenges on the world stage. Trump's steep import tariffs and the countermeasures some affected countries have adopted in retaliation have sent global stock markets into a downward spiral and sparked fears of a global trade war. As an export-driven nation, these tariffs have hit Germany particularly hard — and even more so given that its economy has been in recession for more than two years. The European Union manages trans-Atlantic trade, so Germany cannot act independently in this matter. That's why, in light of its economic vulnerability, the incoming German government is hoping to deescalate. The coalition agreement states that Germany will aim for "a medium-term free trade deal with the United States," while in the short term, "the coalition parties aim to avoid a trade conflict with the US and focus on reducing import tariffs," on both sides of the Atlantic. Given Trump's recent series of economic about-faces, this approach might prove a bit too optimistic. Merz has long been a staunch supporter of trans-Atlantic relations. He chaired Atlantik-Brücke, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fostering US-German relations, for 10 years. And while he's never actually lived in the United States, he does say that the years he spent working for the US-based global investment firm BlackRock made him very familiar with the US mindset. However, ever since Trump retook the White House for a second term, it would appear Merz's faith in close trans-Atlantic ties has been shaken.

But even though Merz has consistently distanced himself from Merkel politically, a personal meeting between him and Trump would likely not be easy. To date, nothing has been planned. Trump's efforts to secure a peace "deal" for Ukraine have relegated European nations to the role of spectators. So far, he has only spoken directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a possible peace framework. Ukraine's Zelenskyy has remained sidelined from discussions. Should an agreement emerge, it's likely to amount to an imposed settlement for Ukraine, and Germany and other EU nations will presumably be left with the task of enforcing it. The incoming coalition appears to want to continue supporting Ukraine. "We stand with the brave Ukrainian people. They can rely on us," said Klingbeil on Wednesday. In reality, the coalition partners have yet to make a final decision on the matter. Until then, it remains unclear how military aid will proceed. While he was still leading the opposition in the previous government under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz advocated for sending Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. Scholz consistently opposed the move, fearing it could draw Germany into direct conflict with Russia. On election night in February, Merz admitted he was unsure whether Trump would honor the US' collective defense commitments under NATO's Article 5, should the need arise. That's why, he said, he wanted to strengthen European defense cooperation, "so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US." Merz has already secured parliamentary approval for his famous financial pledge of "whatever it takes" to strengthen the German armed forces. Part of deepening European defense cooperation would mean exploring ways in which Germany and Europe might benefit from the nuclear deterrence offered by the continent's two nuclear powers, France and the UK. That will be no easy feat, given that neither nuclear power is likely to readily share its capabilities. Many other EU nations also hold reservations against deeper military cooperation. And Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban not only maintains close ties with Russia's Putin, he also opposes military aid for Ukraine. In the past, Merz repeatedly accused Scholz's administration of neglecting European ties, especially regarding Germany's relations with its neighbors France and Poland. Now that he's poised to take charge, Merz aims to change this — but there's much to do. Just days after winning the election, Merz visited French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris. But Macron is politically weakened at home. And while Poland might have a pro-European government under former EU Council President Donald Tusk, Berlin does not have a close relationship with Warsaw. Across the EU enthusiasm for deeper integration has waned, with right-wing populist movements steadily rising in many member states. Amid ongoing trade-related friction with Trump, some politicians in Berlin and Brussels are eyeing China as an alternative trade partner. But trade with China is no longer as lucrative as it once was. German car exports, once a major success in China, have seen declining sales. Now, the EU has begun imposing restrictions on Chinese electric vehicles. As an export-oriented country, Germany will likely try to prevent these trade barriers from becoming too high. The future government will also aim to reduce security risks associated with China. In the coalition agreement, the partners have agreed to "effectively prevent foreign investments in critical infrastructure and strategically relevant sectors that conflict with our national interests." This passage is likely directed straight at China. When it comes to relations with Israel, Germany sees itself in a particularly difficult bind. On the one hand, due to Germany's Nazi past and its orchestration of the Holocaust, in which over 6 million Jews and nearly 5 million other people from minority groups were killed, German governments have since seen a historic duty in safeguarding the state of Israel. On the other hand, Israel's ongoing military action in Gaza and the occupied West Bank has drawn some guarded criticism from German politicians as being disproportionate. Israel claims its military campaign in Gaza and the West Bank is to root out the Palestinian nationalist and Islamist movement Hamas. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, overwhelmingly women and children, and displaced more than 80% of the population. The occupied West Bank has also recently seen a spike in violence, with over 700 Palestinians killed in the same time frame. Germany and several other countries designate Hamas as a terrorist organization. In late 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. This puts Germany in a tough spot. As a signatory to the Rome Statute which underpins the ICC, Germany would be legally obligated to arrest and extradite Netanyahu, should he enter Germany. But Merz has already promised that, under his chancellorship, Germany would "find ways and means" for Netanyahu to visit and leave the country unbothered. At the tail end of the outgoing administration, the Green Party managed to secure significant funding for climate protection and even saw the constitution amended to include the goal of climate neutrality by 2045. But on a global scale, the situation looks much different. Right after taking office, Trump withdrew the US from all international climate agreements. Meanwhile, major US financial institutions like BlackRock and JPMorgan have also distanced themselves from climate-friendly investments. This will make it much harder for Germany to push forward climate protection measures at an international level. Environmental groups suspect the new government is not as committed to the issue, anyway. They see the coalition agreement's wording — "climate protection must be balanced with economic competitiveness and social equity" — as a substantial weakening of Germany's previous climate goals.

Germany's Social Democrats and Conservatives are eager to form a coalition amid the global economic and political uncertainty. The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have announced a coalition agreement, bringing Germany that much closer to forming a new government. It appears international friction and the recent tariff policies imposed by US President Donald Trump pushed negotiators to reach an agreement sooner, rather than later. Presenting the new agreement on Wednesday, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, likely to become the country's next chancellor, said Germany was currently facing a "situation of growing geopolitical tensions." The response of the coalition-in-waiting to these uncertain times, he said, was that "we want to, and we will, help shape change in the world, for Germany." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the SPD, added that "this is a turning point. We are living in truly historic times." When the new government takes office, expected it early May, it will be facing several important challenges on the world stage. Trump's steep import tariffs and the countermeasures some affected countries have adopted in retaliation have sent global stock markets into a downward spiral and sparked fears of a global trade war. As an export-driven nation, these tariffs have hit Germany particularly hard — and even more so given that its economy has been in recession for more than two years. The European Union manages trans-Atlantic trade, so Germany cannot act independently in this matter. That's why, in light of its economic vulnerability, the incoming German government is hoping to deescalate. The coalition agreement states that Germany will aim for "a medium-term free trade deal with the United States," while in the short term, "the coalition parties aim to avoid a trade conflict with the US and focus on reducing import tariffs," on both sides of the Atlantic. Given Trump's recent series of economic about-faces, this approach might prove a bit too optimistic. Merz has long been a staunch supporter of trans-Atlantic relations. He chaired Atlantik-Brücke, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fostering US-German relations, for 10 years. And while he's never actually lived in the United States, he does say that the years he spent working for the US-based global investment firm BlackRock made him very familiar with the US mindset. However, ever since Trump retook the White House for a second term, it would appear Merz's faith in close trans-Atlantic ties has been shaken. When the US president — falsely — blamed Ukraine for Russia's war of aggression, Merz stated that he was " shocked by Donald Trump." And he was reportedly equally appalled when Trump and his vice president, JD Vance , publicly embarrassed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in late February.
