A man has been found guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan whose skeletal remains were found dumped in scrubland in Cork City over two years ago. Niall Long (33), formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork had denied the murder of Mr Quilligan (47) on a date unknown between September 1st 2023 and January 29th 2024. The jury of 10 men and two women returned after four hours and 47 minutes of deliberations on Thursday and found Long guilty of the murder of Quilligan. Long was remanded in custody by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford for sentence at a later date. Meanwhile, the jury asked for more time to consider the evidence against Long’s co-accused, Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork and Ms Justice Lankford asked them to return on Friday to continue their deliberations with regard to Mr Taylor. During the trial, the jury heard that Quilligan’s murder had its origins in an incident where he and another man allegedly robbed Long of drugs and cash off York St in Cork City on September 1st 2023 and Quilligan disappeared later that day. Quilligan’s partner Colette O’Driscoll said that the last time she saw her partner was when he left their apartment at Riverview on Anderson’s Quay in Cork City centre accompanied by Mr Taylor shortly before 9pm on the night of September 1st, 2023. “He [Quilligan] said he would be back in five to 10 minutes when he left with Luke Taylor – I never saw him again,” said Ms O’Driscoll, adding that when he failed to return home, she reported him missing to An Garda Síochána three days later on September 4th. The jury heard that gardaí were able to track Quilligan walking with Mr Taylor up the quays in Cork City to St Finbar’s Placebut there was no sign of him ever emerging at the top of the steps on to Fort Street. However, they heard evidence a white Toyota Rav 4 was seen entering Fort Street and reversing into the steps at the top of St Finbarr’s Place and it was later tracked on CCTV going to Little Island and Rostellan in east Cork where Quilligan’s skeletal remains were found on January 29th, 2024. Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margot Bolster said she was unable to say exactly when Quilligan had died or give a precise cause of death due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem which had resulted in the decay and disappearance of all soft tissue and organs. However, Dr Bolster said it was clear Quilligan had been the victim of a serious assault as he had suffered numerous injuries, including fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jawbone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. The jury also heard evidence from Dr Sarah Fleming of Forensic Science Ireland that she forensically examined blood stains found in the boot of a white Toyota Rav 4 belonging to Long’s mother Janice, and it provided a DNA match with Quilligan. A mat from the boot of the car had DNA profile matches for both Quilligan and Long while bloodstaining on a headrest had a DNA profile match for Quilligan and a light bloodstain on a label of part of a T-shirt found in the car matched both Quilligan’s and Long’s DNA. The jury also heard from Sgt Maurice O’Connor how gardaí were able to retrieve a text sent by Long’s mother, Janice from her phone on September 2nd, 2023, in which she said she noticed a smell of Dettol in the boot of her white Toyota Rav 4. Although gardaí never found Long’s phone they were able to establish the content of a replying message he sent in which he said, “Yeah, it does, the fellow who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and got thrown in the boot, so the boot was cleaned.” The case continues.

Title: City-States Without Limits – Part 2
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/city-states-without-limits-part-2/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity. In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.” The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs. The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain). The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin. By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means. We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments. At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring about the global governance of a patchwork of city-state gov-corp Technates. NRx technocrats want to create a global “patchwork” of digital surveillance societies where “nothing officially exists unless it’s on-chain.” All value is digital and the private founder[s], by virtues of the supreme sovereignty they have purchased with their investment, control their private fiefdoms as CEO “kings” of the ruling corporations. In effect, by exploiting digital technology and, most notably, Artificial Intelligence (AI), the NRx technocrats want to create a global network of privately financed smart-cities. A smart-city can be said to be “an urban area where technology and data collection help improve [. . .] the sustainability and efficiency of city operations. [. . .] Technologies to collect data—including real-time data—are central to smart-city initiatives.” The objective of smart-city design is to control the urban environment and its inhabitants’ behaviour. Taking a positive view of smart-city behavioural control, researchers from the Indonesian Journal of Information Systems and Informatics nonetheless noted: The influence of smart city technology on consumer behavior in urban environments and people’s daily routines and lifestyle habits is significant. [. . .] The development of smart-cities through the application of various technologies such as smart transportation systems, traffic management applications, and smart sensors [. . .] has changed the behavior of people. [. . .] Thus, the application of smart city technology not only transforms city infrastructure and services, but also brings significant changes in citizen behavior. Though behavioural control exercised by smart-city operators could possibly be benign, it could also be abused by despots to effectively program our lives. That is certainly what the NRx technocrats have in mind—engineering the “unthinking demos” whose sovereignty will be treated with “derision.” Regardless of the risks, smart-cities are being constructed the world over. The China Global Television Network (CGTN) is part of the state-run China Media Group. In July of this year, CGTN reported how the Chinese government was “accelerating” the development of smart-cities. CGTN revealed that Shenzhen won an international award for smart-city of the year from the 2024 Smart-City Expo World Congress (SCEWC). The SCEWC emphasised how the congress was impressed with Shenzhen’s application of the Chinese “Smarter City, Better Life” policy initiative that seeks to address “urban challenges” through the rapid deployment of technology. Just like the NRx technocrats in the West, Chinese policy think tanks apparently see technology as the solution; full stop. The SCEWC said: The initiative has pursued an aggressive digital transformation strategy to address these challenges across various sectors. Key components include the development of high-speed broadband networks, using digital twin technology to model and manage city systems, and integrating artificial intelligence and data-driven governance into city operations. [. . .] The city has also fostered an environment that encourages technological innovation and has attracted significant investment from private companies developing smart-city technologies. Again, there is no notable difference between the stakeholder capitalist—public-private partnership—finance model for smart-city construction in China’s SEZs than that found anywhere else. The SCEWC continued: Shenzhen has pioneered the “4321+X” model for smart community development, emphasizing integrating government networks, video networks, IoT sensor networks, and the internet to create comprehensive data and service platforms. These platforms provide a foundation for various smart city applications, including public safety management, community governance, and the delivery of public services. The 4321+X smart-city “community” is controlled based upon a set of clearly defined processes. The “4” refers to the integration of four data networks: the government’s network, private community CCTV networks, the internet, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT). The “3” relates to the three areas of community activity to be integrated within and surveilled through the four networks: all business, public security (public conduct), and the local governance of services, including local security services. The “2” Refers to two major service sectors—called “platforms”—that combine to effect the monitoring of the three key areas of activity linked to the four networks. The two “platforms” are local government and law enforcement. Finally, the “1” refers to the master database which, when Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)—such as blockchain—is used, could be called the “unified ledger.” The ledger ties all the surveillance of the entire smart-city, combining 4, 3, and 2 together, into one centrally administered smart-city system. The smart-city supposedly facilitates “X” which is the artificially intelligent delivery of governance and services to the citizen. The unified ledger (“1”) is monitored and controlled by the “Urban Brain” or “City Brain” which is the central command system for the smart-city. The Urban Planning Society of China—a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that operates by approval from China’s Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Civil Affairs—states that the purpose of the “Urban Brain” is to allocate “public resources” and enhance “social governance” in order to provide “new pathways for promoting sustainable economic and social development.” As we noted in Part 1, China’s modern technological innovation is overwhelmingly the result of public-private partnership. In Hangzhou, for instance, the City Brain is managed by one global corporation: Alibaba is the powerhouse of the technology from data platforms to advance analytics algorithm that enables all the smart city application. In NRx technocrat terms, Alibaba Group is the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) of the city of Hangzhou, with a considerable ability to potentially control the lives of its nine million citizens or “customers.” As with all smart-city developments, the media only reports the realised or projected social benefits. The likely pitfalls are studiously ignored. To understand the danger we all face, if we take to living in such cities, we first need to consider how social credits systems are intended to work. There are many, persistent myths peddled in the West about China’s Social Credit System (SCS). The mainstream media will sometimes have you believe that it is already a totalitarian nightmare and some in the independent media will try to convince you that is doesn’t exist. The truth lies somewhere in between. China is the only country to have formally established an SCS, but it is not the only country to have implemented one. The purpose of social credit is to reward or punish citizen behaviour, not through the courts or any legal process, but through the enhanced or restricted access to both public and private services. Operation Choke Point in the US saw the Department of Justice collaborate with private banks to cut-off access to finance for entirely legal small to medium size businesses deemed to present a “reputational risk.” Similarly, in Canada, the government worked with private banks, and insurers to shut down the small businesses of lawful and legitimate protestors. These are just a couple of the many clear examples of SCS operating in the West. China’s SCS was formally established in 2014. It is a sprawling and often confusing slew of government directives and regulations that each provincial authority has to decipher and apply as best as it can. The overarching objective is to establish a measure of “societal creditworthiness.” This does not just mean “credit” in the financial sense. It relates to the degree of “trustworthiness” the state credits to its own departments and local administrations, to businesses and to individuals. China’s SCS refers to “entities,” meaning both public and private organisations, including businesses. Much of the SCS is focused upon cleaning up public sector corruption, eliminating the “untrustworthiness” of those entities in order to promote a “harmonious” society. It also focuses on the “untrustworthiness” of individuals. An SCS objective is to “put untrustworthy individuals on a credit blacklist.” Another is to develop online systems to evaluate individual’s online social credit “trustworthiness” and, for instance, to punish those who engage in online “rumour-mongering;” it talks about systems to assess the “individual character” of citizens and the enforcement of “citizen morality.” In China, a “natural person” is a legal construct that means a human being or citizen. In its 2025 announced improvements to its SCS, the Chinese government encouraged regional authorities to promote “the credit construction of natural persons” and to establish “sound credit records of natural persons.” Looking at the development of the smart-city in Shenzhen, and the risks of pooling “big data,” researchers from the Berlin Institute of Chinese Studies found: [T]he digital systems in Shenzhen entail a creeping centralisation of data that potentially turns lower administrative government units into mere users of the city-level smart platforms rather than being in control of their own data resources. Smart city development and big data ambitions thereby imply shifting stakeholder relations at the local level and also pull non-governmental stakeholders, such as information technology companies and research institutions, closer to new data flows and smart governance systems. In a world shaped by stakeholder capitalism, “smart governance systems” are invariably controlled by the private sector. Local governments become the “mere users” of the “City Brains” overseen by multinational corporations. The evident objective is to link the behavioural control afforded by smart-city technology to SCS. As pointed out by MIT Technology Review in 2022, there is currently no crushing, universal social credit score in China that enables totalitarian control: There’s no evidence yet that this system has been abused for widespread social control (though it remains possible that it could be wielded to hurt individual rights). Indeed, smart-city technology combined with SCS certainly could be wielded to socially engineer populations. The push towards smart-city developments capable of applying SCS “rules” are by no means restricted to China. It is a global governance policy agenda and the rollout of the necessary digital infrastructure is worldwide. Though most of us are yet to experience the looming overt systematic oppression, it is extremely unwise to ignore that fact that the likely digital panopticon is being erected around us. If we accept the ongoing transformation of the places we live into smart-cities and smart-suburbs, it is the “trust” we will have placed in our rulers, whoever they may be, that is the salient issue. We will have no choice but to trust that the digital control systems we will live in are purely for our benefit. We will have to trust that the enforcement of the SCS rules will be equitable. There is currently no reason to think that will be the case. The potential urban future that the oligarchs driving this agenda have in mind is aligned with the ambitions of the NRx technocrats. It appears that our planned smart city-state future is an envisioned tyranny. The global proliferation of SEZs provides plenty of enticing investment opportunities for NRx technocrats and other oligarchs (See Part 1). SEZs, however, are just one avenue for the potential location of gov-corp Technates. The global transition toward urbanization offers many more. Ironically, the United Nations (UN) both reports on the rampant criminality common to many SEZ developments but also advocates the rapid and significant expansion of SEZs. As noted in Part 1, there is currently little or no evidence that SEZs deliver socioeconomic growth. There is considerable evidence that they seize national territory and transform it into effective private jurisdictions. Yet, in 2022, the UN established the Global Alliance of Special Economic Zones (GASEZ) to increase the SEZ global footprint. GASEZ claims: Special economic zones (SEZs) can make important contributions to economic growth and sustainable development. Zones can help attract investment, create jobs, boost exports, and build productive capacity. [. . .] Collectively SEZs can be more effective in modernization and policy advocacy, and bring on board stakeholders, including governments, the private sector and international organizations. Again, there is virtually no evidence to support GASEZ’ assertions about economic growth. The reason the UN is enthusiastic about SEZ hybrid zone/city developments is that the UN considers them a more effective route for its global “policy advocacy.” Launching GASEZ in 2022, the UN announced: UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ] joined hands with seven global, regional and national associations representing over 7,000 special economic zones (SEZs) to launch a global alliance. [. . .] They [SEZs] go by many different names, including free-trade zones and industrial parks, and are widely used by developed and developing economies. The Global Alliance of Special Economic Zones (GASEZ) seeks to drive the modernization of these zones across the world and maximize their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). [. . .] A new model of sustainable special economic zones is therefore rapidly taking shape and they are contributing to more inclusive, resilient and sustainable economies in the countries where they operate. The UN calls the towns and cities we live in “human settlements.” Charter Cities, SEZs with residential capacity, hybrid zone/city developments, resilient cities, 15-minute cities, etc., are all “human settlements” as far as the UN is concerned. Furthermore, all such urban renewal consistently embraces smart-city technology. In 1977, the UN created the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in order to promote “socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities.” UN-Habitat states: UN-Habitat is the focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters within the UN system. [. . .] UN-Habitat collaborates with governments, intergovernmental, UN agencies, civil society organizations, foundations, academic institutions and the private sector to achieve enduring results in addressing the challenges of urbanization. Urbanization is the process of the population shift from rural to urban living environments, or human settlements in the vernacular of the UN. UN-Habitat has wholeheartedly adopted the public-private partnership, or stakeholder capitalist, model of development to address “the challenges of urbanization.” In 2018, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) reported the findings of its research into World Urbanization Prospects: Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization [. . .] combined with the overall growth of the world’s population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. [. . .] By 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants, most of them in developing regions [. . .] many of them located in Asia and Africa. [. . .] As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development depends increasingly on the successful management of urban growth, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries where the pace of urbanization is projected to be the fastest. With this urbanization prospectus in mind, and with a particular focus on managing urban development in the “Global South”—an umbrella term for developing nations wherever they are located—UN-Habitat released its Strategic Plan 2020-2023: UN-Habitat, in its role as a focal point, will call upon all development actors and stakeholders, [. . .] to work in concert to assist it in implementing its Strategic Plan. [. . .] An important effort is required to rethink engagement with the private sector to leverage investment in sustainable urbanization and to promote more appropriate models of development. The UN is eager to liberate private finance in order to construct human smart-megacity settlements, especially in the emerging and developing markets of the Global South, that meet UN sustainable urbanization targets. Sustainable Development Goal 11—SDG 11—defines the global public-private partnership’s city development agenda. The UN calls this its “New Urban Agenda.” The New Urban Agenda emphasises the importance of building “smart-cities” to meet SDGs: The New Urban Agenda calls for technology and communication networks to be strengthened and for smart-city approaches that use digitalization, clean energy and technologies. [. . .] Innovative funding opportunities and partnerships need to be explored and the capacity of local governments to effectively procure, test and implement frontier technologies needs to be significantly strengthened. [. . .] To contribute effectively to urban sustainability, frontier technologies and innovations need to be applied. The “smart-city” is constructed by deploying so-called “frontier technologies” within its infrastructure. A smart-city could be built from scratch or developed in an existing city or conurbation. The UN explains what smart-city frontier technology it considers essential for urban sustainability: [Frontier technologies] currently include, among others, the Internet of things, sensor networks, machine-to-machine communication, robotics, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, autonomous unmanned vehicles, drones, blockchain, cryptographic computing, and big data processing and visualization. The UN’s “frontier technologies” are, of course, exactly the kind of technologies that the NRx technocrats allege to be the technological solution to everything (see Part 1). Gov-corp Technates are practically indistinguishable from the hybrid zone/city developments envisaged by the UN’s New Urban Agenda. The downside, from humanity’s perspective, is that at both the global intergovernmental level and at the global multinational corporate-network level, there is a firm commitment to install the biometric digital surveillance state that threatens to enslave us all. Though the UN calls this “sustainable development.” Not only is the UN amenable to the NRx technocrat’s digital panopticon plans, it also favours their “patchwork of realms” idea. The UN considers the future of global governance to lay in centralised global authority exerted over a transnational network of city-states. Or, as UN-Habitat puts it, “connectivity across urban networks, between cities and their surroundings [. . .] must be strengthened. That requires a country-wide – and sometimes cross-border – approach to development.” The UN’s global governance model has been moving in this direction or a while. In 2005, then London Mayor Ken Livingston convened the C20 city network, inviting mayors from another eighteen cities to work collectively to reduce so-called climate pollution (CO2 emissions). In 2006, the addition of 22 city mayors created the C40 cities network. The C40 cities network is financed by, among others, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) which is heavily backed by the Gates Foundation. The aim of CIFF is to improve the lives of children living in the Global South by “lobbying” their governments to create regulatory “enabling environments” to stimulate national carbon trading in the global Emissions Trading Scheme (ETF) markets. Another prominent C40 funder is Bloomberg Philanthropies, led by oligarch and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg. Always driven by a commitment to UN global governance policies, in 2011, C40 formalised its relationship with the UN by agreeing on a climate action partnership with the World Bank—a specialized agency of the UN. Such UN partnerships are in keeping with UN ambitions to cultivate its global governance through an international network of city-states. In 2013, American political theorist Benjamin R. Barber (1939 – 2017) published If Mayors Ruled the World: Dysfunctional Nations, Rising Cities. Barber contended that city administrations were more closely connected to their populations and thus more democratically representative than nation-states. He argued that city administrations, in countries around the world, had more in common with each other than they had with their own national governments. Unencumbered by political divisions and national rivalries, he posited that cities were better “building blocks of global governance.” Advocating a global network of cities, Barber wrote: If democracy is to survive globalization, imagining a global democratic order with the city at its core may be crucial. Envision not states but cities as building blocks for global governance. [. . .] Global governance in which the city predominates is the aim. Evidently enthused by Barber’s vision, Michael Bloomberg announced he was stepping down as Mayor of New York and set up the first CityLab summit in 2013. Mayors from cities around the world were invited to network and collaborate in order to “exchange ideas and tackle some of the most urgent issues affecting cities around the world.” In 2014, a month after officially leaving office in New York, Bloomberg was appointed as the UN’s first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. Thus strengthening the link between urban development and the implementation of the global governance agenda. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the objective of creating the post for Bloomberg was for the UN to consult “with mayors and related key stakeholders” in order to “mobilize action among cities as part of [the UN’s] long-term strategy.” Already the president of the board of the C40 cities network, Bloomberg soon established the Compact of Mayors committing city leaders to implement UN SDGs. In 2016, the UN’s Global Compact of Mayors joined with the similar European Union’s (EU’s) Covenant of Mayors to become the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM). Currently acting as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions, Michael Bloomberg is the current co-chair of the GCoM. The GCoM established the INVEST4CITIES initiative to generate “massive and targeted investment” to construct smart-cities. The private sector investment opportunity is set to provide “$23 trillion in investment potential” by 2030. The public sector’s (local government’s) role is to create “the enabling environments that support local investment.” The GCoM plan is that “large-scale financing instruments” will fund “local implementation” of frontier technologies to construct global governance (SDG) compliant smart-cities. In the same year (2016) that the GCoM was signed by an international network of mayors, Bloomberg created the Global Parliament of Mayors (GPM) to give the civic leaders formal global governance roles. The GPM was first mooted in 2013 by Bloomberg CityLab based on Benjamin Barber’s “idea of a global governance platform for cities.” Barber was personally involved in the formation of the GPM and, when he died in 2017, the GPM created the annual Benjamin Barber Award, given to the most global governance compliant mayor of the year. The purpose of the GPM is to attack the supposed political sovereignty of national governments and reimagine international relations. The GPM champions “the city’s right to self-government” and promotes “collective city decision-making across national borders.” The GPM is “actively engaged in decision-making by international organisations.” The GPM is the UN’s expression of Barber’s vision of “global governance in which the city predominates.” In 2017, adopting the NRx technocrats’ accelerationism, the C40 network started implementing a number of “High-Impact Accelerators.” The C40 accelerators form one of the “project pipelines” that contributes toward the GCoM’s INVEST4CITIES strategy. The GCoM aims to “accelerate city and local government access to financial resources” by “removing barriers to investor-oriented climate action plans and projects, and unlocking large-scale financing instruments to boost urban action implementation.” As you can imagine, with $23 trillion of investment opportunities in sight, the envisaged ROI is not only mouthwatering, if the planned city-state is a startup project it also promises oligarchs possible city ownership rights (see Part 1). The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) convened the Day of Cities in 2019. Mayors from across, what the UN called, “the region”—meaning Europe—met to discuss “how to create smart sustainable cities.” This resulted in the 2020 Geneva Declaration of Mayors. In response to multiple alleged global crises—the pseudopandemic, the climate crisis, natural disasters, etc.—the UNECE mayors noted how the global policy response to the pseudopandemic could be adopted as a model for urban development: [C]ities were in lockdown – and many industries, transport networks and businesses closed – we [. . .] started to experience an unknown urban life: better air quality, the return of nature to our cities, and empty streets giving space to cyclists and pedestrians. [. . .] The pandemic provided a testing ground for what cities could look like; the transformation of urban spaces happened overnight. If there is only one lesson to learn from this crisis, it is that rapid change of our urban reality is possible [and] behaviour patterns can be adapted. [. . .] Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 calls for action to work towards [. . .] resilient and sustainable cities – it is now in our hands to place the SDGs at the centre of our recovery efforts and create new urban realities. Today, boasting “over 13,500 cities and local governments” from “6 continents and 147 countries” the GCoM alleges that it represents “more than 1.2 billion people.” It is, however, hard to see how GCoM “represents” anyone other than its public-private “stakeholders.” One wonders how many people who elect their local and city “representatives” in these GCoM coordinated cities and suburbs are told that they are consenting to global governance and the transformation of their communities into smart-city gov-corp Technates. Empty streets, no cars, drone ports, driverless AI controlled public transport, protein labs growing artificial food substitutes, augmented reality, insect-based snacks, and new religious identities are part of what leading oligarch-led think tank Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs) predicted in 2021 with its notion of our Futurescape. Whether this is the future city-life any of us want is irrelevant. At every level, NRx technocrats and their fellow oligarchs view such “urbanization” as the pathway to establishing effective global governance. That the UN considers societal lockdowns as an exemplar of what it calls a “better urban life” betrays the oligarchs’ true intentions. The United Nations (UN) declares that it is responsible for global governance. The UN also says that “governance” means: “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented.” Therefore, the UN asserts that it is the body which makes and implements decisions—which manifest as government policy—for the world. UN-Habitat—the UN’s “focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters”—with its New Urban Agenda to transform the urban environment into a global network of smart-cities, extols stakeholder capitalism and is keen to use the associated public-private partnership model. In 2022, UN-Habitat and the World Economic Forum (WEF) created the The Global Partnership for Local Investment (GPLI). The GPLI immediately set up the G20 Global smart-cities Alliance and clarified its public-private purpose: Public-private collaborations reflect a form of indirect management in public administration, where [. . .] public, private or non-profit partners make decisions jointly. [. . .] Public-private collaborations can repurpose city assets for the deployment of digital infrastructure. [. . .] Physical assets, such as rooftops, utility poles, street lights, traffic lights, ducts and more, can become smart assets and be used to drive efficiencies and new services. Public spaces and airspace can take on new value as technology, such as drones, enabl[e] [sic] new use cases. UN-Habitat and the WEF highlight the private sector investment opportunity for those with the wealth to capitalise on them—oligarchs: [S]mart-city services can generate new revenue streams and revenue savings to be shared between partners. The Futurescape imagined by Chatham House is under construction with the support of the United Nations and the “leading” multinational corporations aligned under the WEF umbrella. It is also a project shared by the BRICS+ group of nations and their corporate partners. The BRICS have established the General Assembly of Cities and Municipalities which will focus on “inter-municipal cooperation” rather than international cooperation. Following the 2025 BRICS summit in Brazil, the BRICS group issued a joint statement: One of the key topics shaping the future of the BRICS is the development of smart-cities supported by emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). [. . .] With the recent expansion of the BRICS to include countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Iran, the bloc is establishing itself as a leading platform for Global South cooperation [. . .] particularly in the realm of sustainable urbanization driven by technologies such as AI. [. . .] Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted in major BRICS cities, notably impacting urban planning, public service management, and civic engagement. China is at the forefront of developing AI-powered smart-cities, particularly in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The BRICS+ group emphasises the importance of the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) to “finance sustainable infrastructure” and “increase lending for AI-driven public service projects.” The group observes that “South-South cooperation through the BRICS creates active dialogue.” The UN considers cooperation in the “South-South”—referring to partnerships between Southern hemisphere countries—“a key development modality to accelerate progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) collaborates strategically with the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). In turn, the IsDB has a close working partnership with the NDB. Both the IsDB and the NDB have joined seven other “Multilateral Development Banks” (MDBs) to form a global collaborative partnership coordinated by the UN’s World Bank Group: A much scaled up global effort is thus required to [. . .] tackle transboundary [meaning cross-national border] challenges. [. . .] We [Heads of MDBs] will deepen our collaboration around joint innovative mechanisms for boosting private capital mobilization, both domestically and globally. [. . .] We recognize the need to explore further avenues for strengthening mobilization of private capital. Regardless of where you live on the Earth, your government’s commitment to creating a global network of smart hybrid zone/cities financed by “private capital” is unshakable because your government is following a global policy agenda it did not create and cannot change. In Vietnam, for example, the commitment to constructing smart-cities is significant. Vietnam’s state media, The Voice of Vietnam (VoV), reports: Vietnam is undergoing a sweeping transformation with a clear goal: to build smart-cities that serve the people. The effort is based on national strategies like the Sustainable smart-city Development Plan 2018-2025 with a vision to 2030, the National Digital Transformation Program until 2025 with a vision to 2030, the E-Government Development Strategy toward a Digital Government, and Project 06 on population data and digital identity. The VoV states that residents in smart-cities can “report issues directly to authorities, who respond and take corrective action.” Vietnamese digital smart-city citizens can raise concerns relating to “public security[,] environmental management, healthcare, [. . .] education,” and more via their installed smart-city app. The VoV enthusiastically notes that centrally located AI monitored Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs)—Urban or City Brains—linked to peoples’ devices and their Vietnam Electronic Identification (VNeID), issued by Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS), effectively turn the Vietnamese smart-city citizens’ “smartphones into ‘microphones.’” The VoV adds: Citizens must also play their part: verifying VNeID at level 2, uploading personal documents to their digital accounts, using the national portal [. . .] for public services, downloading their local smart-city app, and using cashless payments wherever possible. Every tap on a screen lays another brick in building Vietnam’s vision of modern, intelligent, liveable cities for the future. The state taking almost unimaginable control of every “citizen’s” life is part of Vietnam’s digital transformation plan—Project 06. The Vietnamese government has already started the process of freezing up to 86 million of Vietnam’s estimated 200 million banks accounts unless they are “verified” using state approved digital ID (biometric authentication or VNeID). So clearly, every citizen “must” comply and the digital transformation, despite all the fluffy rhetoric about inclusion, is avowedly exclusionary. Project 06 is led by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) working closely with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). A major part of the role of the MPS is to ensure social order and to collect, analyse and evaluate information with a view to “prevent, detect and defeat any plots and acts of violation against national security and eliminate any threats to national security,” to protect the “Party” and the “State,” and to “implement international commitments and obligations.” The digital surveillance plan has been promoted by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and other government officials, but the Project 06 policy initiative did not originate with the Vietnamese government. With its stated “vision to 2030,” Project 06 is firmly rooted in the United Nations’ (UN’s) global governance agenda. The Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Development noted that the country’s digital transformation will contribute to the reduction of (CO2) emissions, though it is obviously designed to enable state surveillance of the population. Speaking in January this year, UN Under-Secretary-General Amandeep Singh Gill said he was impressed with Vietnam’s public-private partnership (multistakeholder) approach to “harness digital technologies for inclusive, sustainable development.” He added: I saw with my own eyes how Viet Nam is pushing forward strongly and proactively in the areas of digital transformation and AI. [. . .] [F]rameworks are needed to ensure that everyone benefits from the technical advancement, and that no one is left behind. [. . .] The Global Digital Compact offers such a framework at the global level, and Viet Nam’s willingness to play an active role in key areas of the [sic] is welcomed and appreciated by the United Nations. The Global Digital Compact, adopted without a vote in September 2024 by UN member states as an annex to the UN’s Pact for the Future, is the UN’s “global framework” to facilitate “multi-stakeholder action” to enable “the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.” The UN defined “digital public goods” as software, data, AI models, and all content published online. Further, it decided that “digital public infrastructure” essentially meant all hardware and the physical infrastructure for all digital communication systems. The UN said that it considered “digital public goods and digital public infrastructure to be key drivers of inclusive digital transformation and innovation.” It added that “[g]overnments, the private sector, civil society, technical and academic communities and international and regional organizations” should work together to to “leverage digital public goods and digital public infrastructure to advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals.” In other words, the UN decided that the internet and digital technology, in its entirety, should be leveraged to deliver the UN’s global governance policy agendas. The UN invited the “private sector and philanthropic actors [oligarchs]” to finance the digital transformation. Populations might not want to go along with the digital transformation of their world, nor the degree of public-private state surveillance foisted upon them. Perhaps anticipating some pushback, the UN decided that anything that questioned its transformative global governance agenda constituted a “form of violence” it calls “misinformation and disinformation”: We must urgently counter and address all forms of violence, including [. . .] all forms of hate speech and discrimination, misinformation and disinformation. [. . .] We commit to, by 2030, [. . .] assess the impact of misinformation and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. [. . .] We further urgently [. . .] [c]all on social media platforms to provide researchers access to data [. . .] to build an evidence base on how to address misinformation and disinformation and hate speech that can inform government and industry policies, standards and best practices The idea that governments and private corporations should form “policies” to address “misinformation and disinformation” might sound reasonable at first, but that all depends upon who decides what constitutes misinformation and disinformation. The UN is clear that misinformation and disinformation incudes information that undermines its policies related to “public health and climate action.” Questioning the global digital transformation that is designed to “advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals” threatens “climate action” and is therefore disinformation that governments and private corporations should “counter and address.” Governments around the world are implementing laws and regulations to seize control of the information we can share with that goal in mind. Of course, this could not be more anti-democratic, but governments serve as functional oligarchies not democracies. None of the governments that have passed or intend to pass online censorship laws are the instigators of these policies or legislative moves. They emanate from the global governance of the UN and its agencies where real Orbital Authority is exercised. In Part 1, we discussed NRx technocrat Curtis Yarvin’s metaphorical exploration of global government that he termed “Orbital Authority.” The global transformation of our urban environments is already being propelled by such authority. It is an oligarch-led public-private, or multistakeholder, global governance authority. Oligarch-backed policy think tanks, such as Bloomberg’s CityLab, and the state-funded public-private partnership think tanks, like the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), form the policy and design the corresponding implementation initiatives. The CAICT calls itself “a specialized think-tank for the government and an innovation and development platform for the industry.” The CAICT acts as an “enabler for innovation and development in an information society.” It is a public-private partnership that “plays an important role in strategy and policy” with respect to the digital transformation in China. Chinese state media recently reported China’s official launch of its plan to provide “processing resources across China,” to link City Brains and other smart-city elements together in a “mega computing project” that will create regional data hubs. From the reports, you would imagine that the CPC was leading the rollout. That impression is misleading. It was the CAICT that proposed the concept of the “National Integrated Computing Power and Network Scheduling Platform” that has given rise to the reportedly state-led mega computing project. The CAICT is also a UN partner with an agreement in place to implement the “digital transformation aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals” across Africa. African governments are not designing “Africa’s digital future” any more than China’s government is heading the “digital transformation” in China. The transformation is a global governance agenda, far beyond the influence of any electorate or population, and national governments’ role is merely to create the enabling environment (see Part 1) to establish the resultant global governance. The UN fully backs and promotes this worldwide digital transformation. In addition, the UN has already established global governance structures “in which the city predominates.” This unwavering transformation of the global polity and societal norms is precisely what the NRx technocrats want and are committed to achieving. The Orbital Authority that Curtis Yarvin deems necessary for “thousands of independent sovereign states and city-states” to “flourish” is being constructed by the UN and its multinational corporate “stakeholders.” The UN is predominantly an oligarch-led project. In 2014, professor of international history Ludovic Tournès, writing for The Journal of Modern European History, highlighted the significant influence of the Rockefellers in establishing the United Nations. In the late 1950s, the Rockefeller-funded Special Studies Project began publishing its findings, culminating in the 1961 publication of the full report titled “Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports.” Seeking to strengthen UN global governance, The Rockefeller Study Project recommended dividing the world “into smaller units” that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority [the UN]” (page 26). The researchers ultimately recommended: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. The idea of a global governance system, based upon a regional balance of power, had been pursued by a trans-Atlantic oligarch network—of which the Rockefellers are leading members—since the early 20th century. As part of the process of “constructive action” to establish this new world order, in 1965 the Rockefellers convened an international conference at their Villa Serbelloni mansion in Bellagio, Italy. Today called the Bellagio Center, the 1965 meeting at the Villa set up the Club of Rome policy think tank which solidified as “a core group of like-minded thinkers” in 1968. In September 1973, the Club of Rome proposed a global governance model that divided the world into ten regions. In their report, titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System,” they described these global governance regions as “Kingdoms.” The same year, David Rockefeller co-founded the Trilateral Commission policy think tank with US political scientist and policy advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Unsurprisingly, the Trilateral Commission claims the authority to “affect [. . .] foreign policy and national security strategies,” across three global regions it calls pillars: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The current model of regional Kingdoms—“pillars” or “poles”—is commonly referred to as multipolarity and the consequent Multipolar World Order (MWO) is said to be in prospect. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is the premier international public-private security policy conference where predominantly, but not exclusively, Western “decision-makers” meet annually to network and form international defence and security policy. The MSC 2025 report informs us that there is a “changing global distribution of power,” adding that a “multipolar world holds significant promise.” However, it also notes that the new multipolar global governance bureaucracy must not impede “joint approaches to global crises and threats.” The MSC determined that “depolarization [. . .] could set multipolarity on a positive track,” where “depolarization” refers to the process of nations accepting their sociopolitical and perhaps cultural differences but aligning to their respective “poles” in order to address “global crises” through collective action. To explain its “depolarization” point, on behalf of the MSC “decision-makers” it represents, the MSC report referenced the 2023 comments of then German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz who said, in order to “keep multilateralism alive in a multipolar world,” it was essential to maintain “greater participation in, and integration into, the international order.” In other words, depolarization is multipolar decentralisation leading to greater centralisation within the global “order.” This is the same decentralization to recentralization trick (see Part 1) favoured by the NRx technocrats. Depolarization is not transforming global governance by chance. Influential oligarch-led policy think tanks, such as the UK-based Chatham House and its sister organisation, the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), have been trying to create the depolarized regional balance of power global governance system for more than a century. The Council on Foreign Relations is among the many Western oligarch-led think tanks to have consistently promoted multipolarity. In 2023, a team of CFR analysts expressed their opinion about what would constitute the perfect “pole” in a Multipolar World Order: The EU [European Union] is a networked union that allows its members to act together in some ways and apart in others. The EU [. . .] has far more power over its members, which remain sovereign states, than any other regional entity. It is one of a kind. [. . .] The EU has developed a template that other regional organizations are following and customizing in various ways. [. . .] Foreign policy practitioners should hope these blocs succeed. Powerful regional unions are the necessary intermediaries between international or global institutions and state and local governments. According to the CFR, the European Union (EU) presents us with the ideal “template” for a MWO pole. Speaking at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, H.E. Wang Yi, Director of the CPC’s Committee Foreign Affairs, stressed that “China has always seen in Europe an important pole in the multipolar world.” China is currently leading the push to create an Asian Union. The CPC and the CFR appear to be in agreement on the perfect “pole.” Though nation-states supposedly remain “sovereign,” the EU-pole exerts “power over its members”—constituent governments. This CFR argument is self-contradictory nonsense. The governments of nation-states cannot possibly be both “sovereign” and, at the same time, subservient to the leadership of their “pole.” It is unconscionable to imagine that the CFR analysts don’t appreciate this point. What they offer is MWO propaganda. The whole point of the regional “pole,” or “union,” is to act as a completely unnecessary “intermediar[y] between international or global institutions and [. . .] governments.” The CFR defines “international or global institutions” as the UN, its specialized agencies, and groups like the International Monetary Fund and the the G20 (Group of Twenty). We have just discussed the G20 Global smart-city Alliance. It embraces stakeholder capitalism, where governments and their private sector partners “make decisions jointly [to] repurpose city assets for the deployment of digital infrastructure.” Given the UN commitment to global governance where “the city predominates,” the discernable nature of the real “Orbital Authority” is materializing. Governments that are functional oligarchies (see Part 1) are being subsumed into regional poles within a Multipolar World Order that has been actively sought by generations of globalist oligarchs. The poles will empower public-private “international organisations”—dominated by private capital (oligarchs)—to set policy for the regional pole’s member state, thereby removing any meaningful expression of national sovereignty. Simultaneously, privately financed smart-city “zones” are being carved out of nation-states as global governance moves toward “collective city decision-making across national borders.” Curtis Yarvin’s “Orbital Authority” was a metaphor, but there is nothing metaphorical about the deliberate, oligarch-led transformation of our world. What they are constructing mirrors the “patchwork” of network states—gov-corp Technates—proposed by the NRx technocrats. The aim is the digital enslavement of humanity to the asserted authority of private capital. Far from resisting this emerging tyranny, governments are willingly hastening the process because they are functional oligarchies. Knowing the kind of feudalistic tyranny they portend, who would ever choose to live in a gov-corp Technate? Unfortunately, millions of the most vulnerable people on earth don’t have much choice regarding where they live and architects of the gov-corp Technates are targetting them to be among their first “customers.” In 2025, the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that refugee migration in 2024 was “driven by conflict, persecution, human rights violations, and instability.” Refugees fled man-made war zones, man-made economic destruction, and man-made persecution—overwhelmingly from countries in the co-called Global South—but there is no sign of people fleeing any climate crisis, anthropogenic or otherwise. Of course, people have to escape natural disasters such as floods and forest fires. But there is no evidence of any upward trend in either the frequency or severity of weather related natural disasters. Again, all too often, we find that the lethal scale of, for example, catastrophic flooding, though undoubtedly caused by extreme weather events, is exacerbated by very poor planning decisions. Nevertheless, as the UNHCR reports, climate change is not a driver of mass migration. Yet, the UN and its partners constantly refer to refugees as largely escaping the “climate crisis.” As there are no climate refugees, the core PR message to the contrary is designed to supposedly justify and facilitate the global governance agenda— the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That there is no evidence of any climate crisis is irrelevant. Our collective belief in the propaganda is all that matters. Back in 2018, shortly before the UN adopted the Global Compact on Migration, at the annual UN convened Mayoral Forum on Human Mobility, Migration and Development, civic leaders from eighty cities formed the UN’s Mayors Migration Council (MMC). The MMC is a sponsored project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors that aims to make “a tangible difference in the lives of urban migrants, displaced people, and receiving communities worldwide.” It further proclaims that it “accelerates ambitious global action on migration and displacement to create a world where urban migrants, displaced people, and receiving communities can thrive.” NRx technocrat accelerationism (see Part 1) is now enmeshed in all levels of global governance. Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors openly declares that its “mission is to accelerate philanthropy in pursuit of a just world by providing deep global expertise.” It is easy to imagine that the ubiquitous use of the term “accelerate,” or variations thereof, is just a reflection of in vogue terminology, but it is omnipresent and we would be naive to overlook its ideological significance. The UN outlines its purpose in its associated Global Compact: Our Ambition is to: Accelerate and scale the global collective impact of business by [. . .] delivering the SDGs through accountable companies and ecosystems that enable change. To this end, the UN adds: The United Nations Global Compact is leading Accelerators to embed SDG-aligned practices deep into business operations and across the value chain to accelerate progress and impact for the 2030 Agenda. Available to participating companies of the UN Global Compact, the Accelerators are run in close collaboration with Global Compact Country Networks and are designed with a view to generating behavior change across a large number of companies at the local level – achieving maximum impact and scale. The UN’s Global Compact is a supposedly “non-binding” policy agenda, first adopted by the United Nations in 2000. The Compact is not focused on intergovernmental cooperation and has virtually nothing to do with nation-states. The UN describes it as “the world’s largest corporate sustainability project.” Agenda 21 is also a non-binding “plan of action” that, in 1992, laid the foundations for the global sustainable development. The Agenda 21 global policy agenda has shaped the lives of nearly everyone on earth in subsequent years. The UN coordinates policy globally and calling its policy agendas “non-binding” is meaningless if the public sector and the private sector rigidly adhere to them. The UN is determined to create “global governance in which the city predominates.” Consequently, the MMC has been empowered by the UN to “influence policy decisions at the national and international level.” As NRx technocrat accelerationism pervades pretty much everything the UN does, the MMC says that it “accelerates global action on migration and displacement.” The MMC has established task forces with other city-state networks, C40 for example, to manage the migration caused by the climate crisis, irrespective of the fact that the UN concedes there are no climate refugees. In addition, as far as the MMC is concerned, international relations based on Westphalian sovereignty is a “broken system” and it has therefore created the financial pathway for investors to directly fund city-state plans for refugees. The MMC’s Global Cities Fund for Migrants and Refugees is set to transform the broken system by directly funding city-states. The Cities Fund offers international donors an investment “pipeline” to circumvent national governments and directly channel “international resources to city governments.” This is to enable “city governments and their local partners to implement projects of their own design.” The focus of the investment is to support “city governments” to manage “their migrant and displaced communities.” The investment pipeline will create a “a marketplace of city-led solutions” and the reason for all of this is to ensure the UN’s “Global Compacts for Migration” is implemented. The UN claims that its Global Compact on Migration (GCM) is grounded in the “values of state sovereignty.” As we have just discussed, there is scant evidence of that. Instead, the Global Compact seeks to apply a “common approach to international migration in all its dimensions.” Those dimensions are encapsulated in the twenty-three GCM Objectives. The first Objective is to harvest as much data as possible from refugees and economic migrants. The third is to develop systems for the sharing of that data with stakeholders. This accompanies Objective 4, which seeks to force “all migrants [to] have proof of legal identity,” by which the UN means digital ID. At the city or “municipal” level, the UN wants to use migrants to implement digital ID as a means of exclusion: Build upon existing practices at the local level that facilitate participation in community life, such as interaction with authorities and access to relevant services, through the issuance of registration cards to all persons living in a municipality, including migrants, that contain basic personal information. That is to say, everyone’s “participation in community life” and everyone’s access to services will be contingent on you having a UN-approved, compatible digital ID. As we have repeatedlydiscussed, the UN’s own research clearly shows that there is no climate crisis-related immigration. Objective 2 is focused upon “minimising the drivers” of migration flows but identifies virtually none but the alleged migration impacts of the so-called climate crisis. Of the twelve clauses to Objective 2, just one briefly mentions “conflict” but only to the extent of “taking into consideration relevant recommendations from State-led consultative processes, such as the Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict.” Despite knowing full well that people have to flee from war, persecution, and poverty, not climate change, the UN’s GCM, supposedly designed to assist the dispossessed and the most vulnerable refugees, has practically nothing to say about tackling any of the actual underlying causes of their plight. Even objective 7, to “reduce vulnerabilities in migration,” says nothing about persecution, impoverishment, or conflict. Instead it insists upon providing refugees with “identification,” presumably because humanitarian assistance simply cannot be provided otherwise. Refugee children should be added to national identity systems and “stakeholders” should be fully engaged in the child’s identification process. The unmistakable purpose of the UN’s GCM “Objectives” is to exploit immigration to cement the UN’s global governance agenda. This is starkly highlighted by “Objective 19: Create conditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all countries.” The UN wants to “harness the benefits of migration as a source of sustainable development.” The main goal is to: Ensure the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [. . .] by fostering and facilitating the positive effects of migration for the realization of all Sustainable Development Goals The UN’s marked lack of any genuine concern for the predicament of refugees is bad enough but, when we then consider who it chooses as its “partners” to assist with its planned migration, the reality that dawns is stomach churning. Titus Gebel is the former Chairman of the Board of the Patri Friedman’s Seasteading Institute—a joint project between Peter Thiel and Friedman—and a partner at NeWay Capital. He is the founder of Tipolis Inc and a leading investor in and legal advisor to Próspera, having previously acted as a legal advisor for the Honduran government’s original ZEDE program (see Part 1). In 2018, Gebel published Free Private Cities: Making Governments Compete For You. His book outlines how private corporations—i.e. Yarvin’s sovcorps—can provide “government as a service.” He suggested that customers should sign a contract in return for the governance they receive from their sovcorp. Governance providers, in various city-states, would compete for customers (citizens) who would be free to leave, subject to contract, if they didn’t like the private government service on offer in their zone (gov-corp Technate). It seems Gebel essentially plagiarised the NRx technocrat’s ideas, first put forward by Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land about a decade before Gebel took credit for his supposedly “completely new” gov-corp Technate model. Clearly an NRx technocrat, Gebel established Tripolis Inc—in the tax haven of Singapore—in order to create new models of innovative governance. Via Tripolis Inc, Gebel, and his coterie of angel investor partners, hope to become the “owner[s] and operator[s]” of their own International Cities: International Cities are privately run communities, based on clear contracts, which provide, enable and facilitate opportunity and choice. International Cities will be established at multiple locations around the world. [. . .] International Cities build on the concept of Special Administrative Regions (SARs) and are the next evolution of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). [. . .] International Cities will be thriving hubs of business and innovation. Special Administrative Regions (SARs) were formulated by the Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping as part of its “one country, two systems” policy. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan were legally designated SARs by the Chinese government in the early 1980s. The intention was to provide regulatory autonomy to hopefully reunified territories, though Taiwan has yet to commit to reunification. That Gebel considers the larger SARs as “the next evolution” of SEZs speaks to the territorial ambitions of those pursuing the city-state agenda. Gebel is also an advisor to the Swiss-based Andan Foundation led by its founder Dr Christian H. Kälin (or Kaelin). The Andan Foundations explains its purpose: Andan leads private sector initiatives to support families fleeing their homes due to war, internal conflict, and climate change. It identifies and develops innovative, sustainable solutions. [. . .] Andan prioritizes projects that expand economic, financial, and political opportunities for both refugee populations and the communities that welcome them. Andan facilitates and propels partnerships between the private sector and UN agencies, governments, NGOs, and academic institutions concerned with refugees and migrants. Andan proposes a business that capitalises on the “opportunities” presented by refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants. The Foundation adds that its “main, long-term project is the Andan Free Global City project—or “International City” as Gebel would call it—which it says has the potential to “completely upend and reform how we deal with the growing global refugee and migration crisis”: Today, the world is spending billions of dollars each year in dead-end, protracted refugee management with camps and urban settings. [. . .] We aim at no less than completely turn around the way we look at refugees and migrants. [. . .] What we need is again a safe harbour, a new place where refugees and other migrants forced to leave their homes receive the opportunity to live. [. . .] We need free Global Cities – autonomous, self-governed subnational entities that provide a safe environment. [. . .] We are also actively engaged with several governments around the world, as well as with a few major investors who are prepared to finance the establishment of the first free Global City, which will also provide a decent return on capital from private investors. Kälin, an advisor to the Swiss government among others, suggests reading a 2022 article by Albert Steck to really get a feel for what he, Gebel and other international NRx technocrats are proposing: [Kälin] sees his Andan Global City not only as a humanitarian project, but also as a profitable business idea. [. . .] In Kälin’s city [refugees] would be motivated workers and founders of businesses. [. . .] [Kälin is] in talks with representatives of the U.N. and the World Economic Forum. [. . .] The biggest challenge is finding a country that will provide an uninhabited or sparsely populated territory for an autonomous city, he says. [. . .] Initially, several tens of thousands of people could live there – with the prospect that it might ultimately become a city of millions. Private financing is therefore crucial to the success of such a large project, says entrepreneur Titus Gebel. [. . .] Gebel, who was born in Germany, is also the founder of the Free Cities Foundation, which works to establish special economic zones in various countries, following the example of Shenzhen in China or the European free cities in the Middle Ages. Like all NRx technocrat fronts, the Andan Foundation staunchly advocates digital ID and suggests that blockchain “has the potential to create new solutions for refugee and identification systems” and that digital ID, stored on a unified ledger, should be “directly accessible to refugees and immigrants.” Once the refugee’s digital twin is operational, the refugees can serve as “motivated workers” in the Free Global City—gov-corp Technate. Presumably, should they be insufficiently motivated, their access to money and food “could be frozen” and they could be “locked out of all doors” to essential services until they rediscover the correct motivation. Christian Kälin is also the Chairman of Henley & Partners, a UK based consultancy that specialises in a lucrative venture which Kälin claims to have “pioneered.” Henley & Partners touts itself as “the world’s foremost experts in investment migration and citizenship-by-investment.” Serving a clientele of “internationally mobile entrepreneurs and investors,” Henley & Partners (H&P) says that it helps “high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals” to obtain “bespoke residence and citizenship by investment.” Essentially, Kälin and H&P advises “ultra-high-net-worth individuals”—including oligarchs—where to invest in order to buy residency visas and citizenship and then manages the application process for them. The history of “citizenship-by-investment” (CBI) schemes is not very edifying. For example, Paolo Zampolli, President Trump’s global envoy for special partnerships, was evidently involved in a seemingly corrupt CBI scheme that sold Dominican Republic residency to Chinese billionaires, such as Ng Lap Seng, who were under investigation by the UN for bribing UN officials. John Ashe, the former president of the UN General Assembly, was also suspected of involvement but died in an extremely bizarre bar-bell “accident” shortly before he was due to testify in the case. Kälin has been dubbed the “Passport King” for his pioneering efforts in the CBI field. However, according to US-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), H&P has been involved in numerous corrupt CBI schemes. For instance, in the Caribbean nation of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis between 2006 and 2013. The St. Kitts and Nevis Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) was “set up in 2006 to move the island economy away from dependence on sugar.” The SIDF turned agricultural land into development land. The purchase of territory was funded by the government and H&P’s “high-net-worth” clients seeking residency in St. Kitts and Nevis, many of whom had criminal ties or were wanted in various jurisdictions. Money from the SIDF fund was then directed to invest in companies that Kälin was closely associated with. H&P insisted there was no conflict of interest. The SIDF became inoperative around 2017 and, with important agricultural land lost and no sign of any return on the government’s SIDF investment, the OCCRP noted that the “ultimate losers were the people of St. Kitts and Nevis.” Kälin was seemingly the financier behind the Strategic Communications Laboratories Group’s (SCL’s) 2010 re-election campaign for then St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas. In 2018, an interim UK parliamentary investigatory report issued by the powerful Digital, Media, Culture and Sports Committee (DMCSC) noted: 211. We were told, behind much of SCL Elections’ campaigning work was the hidden hand of Christian Kalin, Chairman of Henley and Partners, who arranged for investors to supply the funding to pay for campaigns, and then organised SCL to write their manifesto and oversee the whole campaign process. In exchange [. . .] Henley and Partners would gain exclusive passport rights for that country, under a citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programme.[. . .] Christian Kalin [has] been described as having a ‘Faustian pact’. With the exclusive passport rights came a government that would be conducive to Mr. Kalin and his clients. The British defence contractor SCL is the parent company of the notorious Cambridge Analytica (CA)that was widely accused of manipulating the 2016 US presidential elections and the UK “BREXIT” referendum on leaving the European Union (EU). The CA operation also illegitimately acquired the data of millions of Facebook users. Hence, the UK parliamentary investigation. CA, and thus SCL, is evidently connected to Peter Thiel’s Palantir. As CA’s suspected election manipulation, and what was tantamount to data theft, came under international scrutiny, Palantir disavowed that connection. But, when the New York Times revealed that one of its employees—Palantir business manager Alfredas Chmieliauskas—had worked with CA to form “behavioural profiles” of voting social media users, Palantir changed its statement and said Mr Chmieliauskas was not acting on Palantir’s behalf at the time, though he was a Palantir employee throughout the period. H&P’s CBI schemes were not limited to the Caribbean. They have reportedly been found to be wholly corrupt in Cyprus, for instance. When, in 2017, Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia started to expose H&B’s involvement in Malta’s corrupt Individual Investor Programme (IIP)—Malta’s CBI scheme—subsequent inquiry hearings revealed emails indicating that H&P instigated a Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPP) against her. It seems H&P intended to file the lawsuit in the UK because they wanted a “sympathetic judge.” Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was also instrumental in reporting the Panama Papers, was assassinated in a car bombing in Malta in October 2017. More recently, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled the Maltese CBI scheme illegal. As an EU member state, a Maltese passport provided some questionable “ultra-high-income individuals” with EU citizenship. It is not without justification that the ECJ characterised CBI schemes, including those run by H&B, as making “the acquisition of nationality a mere commercial transaction.” Kälin, who conceded that some H&B clients were “problem[s]” who fell through H&B’s claimed “due diligence” checks, was undeterred by the ECJ ruling. He was enthused by the global expansion of CBI schemes and, in particular, the Trump administration’s plan to issue permanent residency visas to anyone who can afford the $5 million price tag. If he wants to move to the US, Kälin could certainly afford a US “gold card.” Fours years earlier, In 2021, numerous hedge funds faced potential ruin as a result of the GameStop short squeeze. When Reddit users noticed the mass shorting of stock in the the GameStop chain of high-street stores, they apparently spiked demand for the stock and pushed the price up by coordinating large-scale stock purchases. Thus leaving those with short positions—betting the stock price would fall—exposed to enormous losses. Through his company Arnova Capital, Christian Kälin consequently made a fortune on the GameStop stock his company held. He also accurately predicted, before any WHO announcement of a worldwide pandemic, that energy prices would soar during the pseudopandemic. Kälin’s 2000% ROI on his initial investment in Arnova Capital is truly remarkable. The Andan Foundation, founded by Kälin and advised by Gebel, that seeks to profit from refugee migration by establishing Free Global Cities, is a “long-standing” partner of the United Nations. The goal of the partnership is to “propel and facilitate the private sector’s involvement,” in managing international refugee migration with a view to create “public and private initiatives that create long-term solutions for refugees.” The appalling stench of neocolonialism exudes from every part of the UN’s global migration policy agenda. The oligarch-led UN public-private partnership is implementing a strategy that aims to exploit migrants and refugees to achieve UN objectives. There is no serious attempt to do anything to address the problems that cause mass migration. The migrant is simply a “human resource” to be identified, stamped and relocated into communities the world over in order to achieve UN policy targets. The UN wants to construct a global network smart-city gov-corp Technates because that too will better facilitate the rollout of its global governance; it has formed partnerships with NRx technocrats who want to use the displaced as a workforce and who view refugee “residency” in their gov-corp Technates as a “profitable business idea;” the UN is supporting and encouraging the national governments to hand over territory to oligarch investors in preparation for its New Urban Agenda, and the UN wants all lives, including those of refugees and economic migrants, to be controlled by digital technology linked to the digital ID of their digital twin. The networks, technological systems, and investment “pipelines” are in place to enable gov-corp Technate ultra-high-net-worth “founders” to buy citizenship, should they wish, and set up gov-corp Technates either by investing in SEZs or smart-city developments already underway. In 2024, the UNHCR estimated that there were 123.2 million displaced people seeking refuge. Clearly, NRx technocrats like Titus Gebel and Christian Kälin hope to provide said refuge for a profitable return. In 2023, on the US election campaign trail, calling it a “quantum leap,” Donald Trump proposed initially constructing ten “Freedom Cities” in the US. As reported by Bloomberg: The end game is audacious: High-tech company towns free from state law and most federal rules—including the Internal Revenue Code, major environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act; worker protections like the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act; and the Affordable Care Act. There are currently around 300 SEZs in the US and the potential for expansion of the Freedom City concept in the US is already marked. The Freedom City idea, though it provides the same SEZ regulatory advantages to multinational corporations, stands apart somewhat from other SEZ initiatives. The Freedom Cities will be constructed on parcels of US territory sold-off directly to private investors. Initially, the Trump administration tried to sell-off US territory to oligarchs through public land sale provisions included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. Due to public and political opposition, the public land sale clauses were removed prior to the Bill passing. The NRx technocrats behind the Trump administration are, however, determined. They are now trying to use Trump’s proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) for the same purpose. Inherent in the US SWF plan is the intention to liquidate—sell-off—US public land (territory) to raise capital. It remains to be seen if this line of attack will work where the Big Beautiful Bill assault failed. There is a powerful international network, led by US NRx technocrats, exploring every avenue to get the gov-corp Technates—Freedom Cities—built in the US. Peter Thiel protégé, and an NRx technocrat in his own right, Sam Altman, stood close to Oracle’s Larry Ellison, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and President Trump when Trump announced his administration’s Stargate Project. According to Altman’s OpenAI: The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. [. . .] The initial equity funders in Stargate are SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX. SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners for Stargate, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility. Masayoshi Son will be the chairman. Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners. [. . .] All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI [artificial generative intelligence]—for the benefit of all of humanity. We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity. “All of us” refers to the global NRx technocrat community of which Sam Altman, Larry Ellison, and Masayoshi Son (Masayoshi Yasumoto) are members. The intention to use AI to “elevate humanity” means to meld us with technology and turn is into programmable “technoplastic beings.” Masayoshi Son is the head of the technology investment holding company SoftBank Group (SBG) which has capitalised handsomely on its investments in Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba. This is largely due to its control of the Chinese social media firm TikTok, ByteDance, the largest social media company in the world by revenue, is currently valued at around $330 billion. This makes SoftBank’s 4% stake in ByteDance worth roughly $13.2 billion. It remains to be seen if Larry Ellison’s $14 billion deal to buy out ByteDance’ stake in TikTok’s US operation will help Masayoshi Son’s to increase his ByteDance holdings. Certainly, it should provide him with a healthy dividend. Trump has spoken about “four or five world-class investors” profiting from the deal, but both he and Ellison have been coy about officially naming them. Project Stargate was launched to much fanfare, in keeping with the rhetoric in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, as the US was supposedly set on a course to outcompete China’s DeepSeek AI development program, which is key to the Hangzhou City-Brain project. Closer scrutiny of Stargate, however, brings the whole notion of competition into question. Prior to the Stargate launch, in September 2024, Blackrock, its owned subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Microsoft, and MGX announced their Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to to fuel AI innovation. This was a worldwide venture but there was a focus on supporting AI innovation in the US. The GAIIP implementing partners included NVIDIA. As a founding member of GAIIP, UAE-based AI investor MGX is also a “lead partner” in Stargate. MGX is owned by the sovereign wealth fund (Mubadala) of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi ruled by former UAE president Sheik Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Shortly after the January 2025 launch of Stargate, in February, Sam Altman visited Abu Dhabi to discuss finance for Stargate with MGX. This resulted in an initial, accelerated $6.6 billion Stargate start-up investment round. BlackRock, and notably its GIP, receive billions of dollars of private equity investment from China’s state-run investment arms such as the State Administration of Foreign Assets and the China Investment Corporation (CIC). As Trump ramped up his allegedly tough competitive stance against China, by April 2025 the Chinese financiers were pulling back on their enormous US private equity commitments. Doubtless, this was much to the chagrin of Blackrock, MGX and other GAIIP partners. DeepSeek AI developers in China were reliant on the US-based multinational NVIDIA’s H20 processors which are manufactured under license in Taiwan. NVIDIA is a “key technology partner” of Stargate. Having initially “banned” H20 sales to China, reportedly following some meetings with Jensen Huang—co-founder and CEO of GAIIP partner NVIDIA—the Trump administration started lifting the H20 export ban, more or less as soon as it had been imposed, in April 2025. This later became the official position as, it seems, the initial ban was a mistake. In May 2025, Trump was dispatched to Abu Dhabi where he signed a deal to supply US AI-chips, including NVIDIA processors, to the Abu Dhabi AI digital transformation hub. An associated agreement was made for US tech firms to collaborate on AI development in the Emirate and the wider UAE. Trump called the deal the “U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership.” In what was clearly a deal sweetener, just a couple of weeks prior to the Trump-UAE deal, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, met Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Sardinia. Sheik Tahnoon is the Abu Dhabi Emir’s brother, UAE National Security Advisor, and CEO of MGX (Mubadala). Sheik Tahnoon agreed to invest $2 billion in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture owned by the Witkoff and Trump families. Though this looks like blatant corruption, the official fact-checkers have declared everything unimpeachable and have defined the truth for us. Any suggestions that this chain of events clearly evidences high level political corruption have all been officially labelled as “baseless rumours.” Fact-checking heavyweight Snopes reliably informed us: While the two deals happened within two weeks and there was an overlap of people who were involved in them, there was no evidence the first, between MGX and World Liberty Financial, was a direct bribe for the second deal, which involved the chips. So, thankfully, the approved fact-checkers have answered all of our questions for us and that’s an end to the matter. In the media-spun war of words, and that is evidently all it is, China has now reportedly banned the import of the NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000D—the successor to the H20. But China doesn’t need to import processors from the US because the UAE-China AI partnership, specifically the Abu Dhabi digital transformation hub, has a Trump administration agreement in place for the supply of the processors and it serves as a “crucial base for Chinese AI firms.” The purported Stargate “competition” with DeepSeek AI looks more like a “partnership.” So what else might be going on here? When Forbes reported the launch of Stargate on January 2025, its journalists said the “details of the venture are unclear at this early stage.” Why they made this claim is perplexing. The details were not unclear. In November 2024, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, the driving force behind Stargate, announced its “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure.” AI in America: OpenAI’s Economic Blueprint, is Stargate mapped out. This was published before the official White House Stargate announcement and there was no need for any journalist to be “unclear” about any aspect of it. The “Blueprint” talks about the need to merge “private-sector vision and innovation with public-sector enlightenment to unlock the new technology;” a plan for “building the infrastructure needed to produce enough energy;” investment to develop “the next generation of energy technology, including sustainable sources such as fission, fusion, and other promising technologies;” and it notes the need for “common-sense rules” to help “innovators thrive by encouraging investment [. . .] and greater freedom.” The NRx technocrat “Blueprint” also defines the alleged need for Freedom Cities: We need a foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI. This includes policies and initiatives that encourage rather than stifle developers; support a thriving AI-ready workforce and ecosystems of labs, start-ups and larger companies; and secure America’s leadership on AI into the future, such as: AI Economic Zones, created by local, state and the federal government together with industry, that significantly speed up the permitting processes for building AI infrastructure like new solar arrays, wind farms and nuclear reactors. These will be what Bloomberg calls “towns free from state law and most federal rules.” Just as the plan for Freedom Cities in the US preceded Stargate, the UK’s deal with Blackrock to develop “freeports” in the UK (see Part 1) had preceded the rollout of the NRx technocrats’ UK Stargate project. It is the same NRx technocrat network imposing the same SEZ-based independent jurisdiction model wherever you look. Mark Lutter, for example, serves on the board of the Frontier Foundation that was set up to promote the Freedom City initiative in the US. As we discussed in Part 1, Lutter is also the founder and Executive Director of the Charter Cities Institute which states it is proud to support the development of Freedom Cities in the US.Titus Gebel, who wants to profit from migrants and refugees, works closely with Lutter. As previously noted, Lutter served as the head economist for NeWAY Capital and Gebel is a NeWay Capital Partner. Nick Allen, President of the Frontier Foundation and Lutter’s colleague, is very eager to make use of Trump’s SWF grift and toldWIREDthat federal land close to cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon would be great places to build gov-corp Technates. Speaking on behalf of the Frontier Foundation, Allen added: If we’re able to get a legislative transfer of land from the US government to make a public-private partnership, or a trust, or even a private corporation, then it’s a lower cost of capital. [. . .] There’s so much capital and there’s so much political will, but yet there’s an inability to develop these [frontier] technologies. And the inability comes from lack of space and too many regulations. NeWay capital established the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which promotes the idea of Freedom Cities as “Cities Without Limits.” This means towns and cities where there are no regulation and oligarchs are free to do what they please. In addition to NeWay Capital, the FCC is also backed by Pronomos Capital led by NRx Technocrats Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Joe Lonsdale. The FCC claims that Freedom Cities or, in Stargate terminology, “AI Economic Zones,” represent “America’s boldest solution to unleash our nation’s full potential.” They will be constructed in “zones of regulatory clarity” which will be “specially designated areas” where “entrepreneurs” can “move at the speed of human ingenuity” without having to bother with any overbearing federal laws or regulations. The FCC adds: Freedom Cities are more than just economic zones. [. . .] Imagine communities where housing is abundant and affordable, [. . .] where breakthrough technologies move from lab to market at lightning speed because innovators are free to innovate. This is how we’ll overcome stagnation, outcompete China, and create a new American century. Freedom Cities give us the chance to prove once again what Americans can achieve when we’re unshackled from outdated systems and empowered to build the future. With regard to where the Freedom Cities will be built, the FCC notes: 28% Of US land is federally owned and ready for innovative development. If the Trump administration’s SWF plans proceed, this will open the door for NRx technocrats and other oligarchs to buy up US territory to build their gov-corp Technates. The political will certainly appears to be there. Trump’s long-time economic advisor Stephen Moore supports the city-state model. Moore is the former chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, which was behind Project 2025’s Promise to America. The Trump administration came to power promising to tackle the pernicious influence of “American elites” and was therefore eager to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 “Promise,” which was funded by the Koch and Bradley families, among other so-called American elites. Regardless, most of Trump’s Executive Orders, issued when he came to power for the second time, were practically written by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The same group of American elites are also behind the State Policy Network (SPN) that proposed the “Compact For America” shortly before Trump’s first US election win in 2016. What Trump termed Freedom Cities in 2023, the Compact for America, whose National Spokesman was Stephen Moore, called Prosperity Districts in 2015. The terminology has changed, but the intention to create gov-corp Technates in the US has not. As we discussed in Part 1, just as the “authority” is formed to oversee the independent jurisdiction of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), so the Prosperity District (PD) would be the authority that rules within the jurisdictional boundaries permitted by amenable “Prosperity States” within the US. Once approved, the PD would wield policing powers, it would control all “municipal services” through public-private partnerships, and set all regulations within its jurisdiction. Just as with the “authority” ruling an SEZ, the PD would expand by petitioning the willing State to expand itself: The formation or expansion of the PD replaces, within its boundaries, all state laws above the baseline of the state constitution, common law, criminal law and existing compacts. The PDs created within Prosperity States liberate residents, transforming states into strongholds of free markets, federalism and limited government once again. Safe to say, Trump did not come up with the notion of the Freedom City. It is simply the rebranding for the oligarchs’ Prosperity District idea. The gov-corp Technate has been the NRx technocrat’s favoured path to corporate “prosperity” and social control for more than a decade at this point. During its first term, the Trump administration tried to put Stephen Moore on the board of the Federal Reserve to ensure favourable monetary policy suited to the formation of Prosperity Districts. The Democratic wing of the Establishment reacted strongly against Moore’s possible appointment and the bid did not succeed. With their second Trump term underway, the NRx Technocrats—the Silicon Valley-based new breed of American elites—have joined forces with their more traditional oligarch partners for the same ends: to build Freedom Cities, Prosperity Districts, SEZs, gov-corp Technates, call them what you like. The US intelligence community is also onboard. This isn’t surprising given that NRx technocrat’s corporations, such as Peter Thiel’s Palantir and Larry Ellison’s Oracle, have deep ties with US intelligence. America’s Frontier Fund (AFF), is a supposedly a “nonprofit” venture capital operation with a nonprofit foundation, backed by Bilderbergers Eric Schmidt and Peter Thiel. The AFF is essentially an impact investment cut-out of the US intelligence and national security apparatus. It was founded and is currently led by Gilman Louie. He is the “former” CEO of the CIA’s investment arm In-Q-Tel (1999 – 2006) and thereafter acted as a defence, national security and intelligence advisor for the US government. Notably, Louie was at the helm of In-Q-Tel when it “accelerated” the startup called Palantir. The AFF’s aim is to harness the “promise of frontier technology.” This is the same “frontier technology” that the UN’s “New Urban Agenda” is based upon, with a view of constructing smart city-states the world over. It is not a coincidence that it is also precisely the same “frontier technology” that the NRx technocrats behind the AFF want to use to enslave humanity. It is, after all, part of the same, global gov-corp Technate plan. The global agenda, moving us toward digital slavery, is impregnable and is not something any of us can vote are way out of. Our only realistic option is not to comply with the adoption of the “smart” frontier technology people like Gilman Louie, and his intelligence linked network of NRx technocrats want us to adopt. This entire, global, gov-corp Technate project could not be more anti-democratic. The Dark Enlightenment and the Technocracy favoured by the NRx technocrats represent the zenith of totalitarian ideology. Their oligarch partners enthusiasm to adopt the same Patchwork of city-states is equally born from the desire to control everyone and everything. Schmidt, Thiel, and Louie were instrumental in setting up the AFF under the previous Biden administration. It would be a mistake to imagine the global agenda to entrap us in smart city-states is a partisan issue. The squabbles we see, such as Democrat opposition to the appointment of Moore to the Fed, are just that: petty squabbles among the ranks. In 2024, the Future Union, which seeks to “fuse private sector capitalism” with political authority, declared Gilman Louie the “top investor supporting democracy.” Louie narrowly pipped other egalitarian, democracy-loving NRx technocrat investors, like Peter Thiel, Eric Shmidt, and Marc Andreessen, to the top prize. Were the intention of their accelerationist investment strategies not so malevolent we could perhaps laugh at the irony.

A MAN HAS been found guilty of the murder of 47 year old man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag at a ravine in rural east Cork. The jury of ten men and two women spent just under five hours deliberating at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork before finding Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan, who remains were discovered in Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on January 29th 2024. They will resume their deliberations in relation to his co accused Luke Taylor (27) tomorrow morning. The two accused went on trial earlier this month charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan who was last seen alive on 1 September, 2023. He had been missing for five months when his remains were detected by gardai who had brought a cadaver dog to scrubland in East Cork. In his closing speech to the jury Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan said that Kieran Quilligan was “lured” to his death. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long “ambushed” him. O’Sullivan said that the men then threw Kieran Quilligan in to the boot of a car. He said that the “instigating factor” in relation to what occurred involved Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs from Niall Long earlier that day. “Following a robbery by Kieran Quilligan on Niall Long Luke Taylor lures Kieran Quilligan to a lane. He is ambushed by the two of them. He is put in the boot of the car. `They go straight to Little Island (in Co Cork) to a laneway. Down the laneway to a farm. They go down to a nice quiet spot. They are heading home twenty minutes later. What is going on? When the skeletal remains are found there are 19 broken bones, some showing use of an implement like a hammer. Luke Taylor lured Kieran Quilligan to his death. They ambushed him. He was disposed of down that lane.” O’Sullivan said that the body was removed from Little Island three days later and dumped in East Cork. He added that but for the incredible investigative work by gardai the remains would never have been found. Advertisement The jury also heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, who carried out a postmortem on the remains of Quilligan at Cork University Hospital. Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault in a laneway.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, chest, leg and hand bones, jaw bones, neck and skull. Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “mother” and a date. An inscription was illegible. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Bolster also described her examination of the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine off a roadway where there was a jute bag. Underneath this was another jute bag with a “pelvic bone protruding.” The pathologist said she could see ribs and a skull with a “bag around it tied with a knot.” Bolster indicated that the cable tie around the left ankle and right shin and two knotted pieces of plastic around the neck were likely to have been used for the purposes of moving the body. The jury also heard evidence from Sgt Maurice O’Connor who was responsible for analysing mobile phones seized during the course of the investigation. O’Connor gave evidence to the effect that Niall Long had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September, 2023. She has texted him saying that her jeep smelled of Dettol. The garda sergeant said that Long texted his mother. In his reply he stated that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” The jury heard evidence from forty seven witnesses. Prosecution counsel Donal O’Sullivan noted that the jury had watched a “staggering amount” of CCTV footage. Over the course of three days of the trial they watched 433 video clips. The charge facing both accused was the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September, 2023 and 29 January, 2024, at an unknown location within the state of the District Court area of Cork city. Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork city.

A man has been found guilty of the murder of a 47-year-old man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag at a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on 29 January 2024.

Rowe Price, one of the biggest old-school fund managers in the US with roots stretching back to 1937, is finally dipping its toes into crypto, but not just with another Bitcoin tracker. A Oct. 22 SEC filing reveals the $1.8 trillion firm wants to run a fund with a “diversified basket of crypto assets,” targeting between 5-15 coins weighted differently than the usual market cap approach. They aim to beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index (the top ten exchange-listed tokens) while keeping the freedom to zig when others zag. This puts T. Rowe in a small club of major players designing products around active management instead of simple exposure. It’s a departure from what BlackRock did with its spot Bitcoin ETF (now holding about $90 billion) and Fidelity’s $23 billion fund. Those are just passive Bitcoin conduits; T. Rowe’s approach is more like an equity fund, with managers trying to outperform by making smart allocation choices across multiple assets. The Baltimore firm has watched money flow out of its mutual funds for years, many of which couldn’t keep up with passive benchmarks. Since 2021, they’ve lost over $67 billion in assets under management despite the broader market rally. CEO Rob Sharps has been under pressure to modernize the 87-year-old firm’s approach, especially as younger investors increasingly bypass traditional funds altogether. Crypto gives them a fresh battleground where active management might actually still work. They’ve already built the trading infrastructure, with “end-to-end capabilities” for custody and execution. T. Rowe has historically been more conservative than peers like BlackRock, and they were noticeably absent from the first wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This makes their multi-coin approach even more surprising. The FTSE Crypto US Listed Index currently includes Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside alts like Solana and XRP, hinting at what the portfolio might look like. Their square-root weighting means smaller assets get proportionally bigger allocations than in typical market-cap models. For example, if Solana represents 5% of the crypto market cap, it might get closer to 15-20% allocation under this model. This matters because every major ETF so far has just reinforced Bitcoin’s dominance. A multi-asset approach could finally spread liquidity more evenly across the upper tier of crypto. This structure also shows how institutions are gradually accepting altcoins within regulatory boundaries. By sticking to “listed” assets, the index essentially limits the fund to tokens traded on US-compliant exchanges, providing legal cover while expanding options. For investors, that means getting exposure to assets like Solana, Cardano, or XRP without dealing with sketchy offshore products. The implications for crypto markets run deep. Current institutional flows primarily feed Bitcoin’s liquidity, with smaller trickles to Ethereum. If approved, T. Rowe’s fund could create more balanced institutional demand across multiple assets. With T. Rowe managing over $1.8 trillion, even a tiny allocation percentage could represent billions in potential inflows to altcoins. There’s a bigger strategy here: active, multi-asset ETFs might shape the next wave of crypto money flows. BlackRock and Fidelity built empires on Bitcoin’s simplicity; T. Rowe is betting people now want professional judgment over what comes next. The fund would test whether crypto can evolve from a single-asset play into a managed allocation, similar to how big institutions diversify across sectors. With Trump supporting digital assets and the CME preparing 24-hour crypto futures trading next year, traditional finance is making more room for digital assets. T. Rowe’s move fits right into this trend: crypto is shifting from fringe speculation to a legitimate asset class. For retail investors, T. Rowe’s entry offers something different: professional risk management in a notoriously volatile space. Rather than trying to time individual altcoins, they could potentially benefit from T. Rowe’s century of investment experience applied to the crypto market. The fund would essentially function as a “crypto portfolio in a box,” potentially attracting investors who find individual token selection overwhelming. Industry veterans might recognize this as part of a broader pattern. First came Bitcoin-only vehicles, then Ethereum. Multi-asset funds represent the third wave of institutional crypto adoption. The next logical steps would be sector-focused crypto ETFs (like “DeFi-only” or “Web3 Infrastructure”), followed eventually by thematic crypto funds mirroring how traditional ETFs evolved. Whether this kicks off an “altcoin ETF season” depends on how regulators handle multi-asset exposure. But the precedent is there. If T. Rowe gets approval, others will follow with their own mixes of liquidity, custody partners, and index rules. Franklin Templeton and Invesco are reportedly watching closely, with their own multi-asset frameworks nearly ready. What started as a Bitcoin ETF arms race could become a competition over who defines the broader investable universe of crypto, potentially reshaping how capital flows into digital assets for decades to come.

Title: Trillion-Dollar Legacy Asset Manager Enters Crypto Space with ETF Covering XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu
URL: https://zycrypto.com/trillion-dollar-legacy-asset-manager-enters-crypto-space-with-etf-covering-xrp-solana-cardano-shiba-inu/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T12:18:09Z
Full Content:
A $1.8 trillion mutual fund giant is seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its first crypto-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a bold move into the digital assets industry. T. Rowe Price surprised onlookers after filing for an S-1 registration statement with the SEC on Wednesday to introduce the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF. The application states that the fund is expected to hold five to 15 crypto assets that are eligible under the SEC’s generic listing standards, which include Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Litecoin, Polkadot, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Stellar Lumen, and Shiba Inu. These listing standards, recently approved by the SEC, significantly shorten the timeline for crypto ETFs to start trading. If approved, the fund would give investors active exposure to digital assets, a significant shift that would shake up its largely mutual fund-focused offerings. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a post on X that the filing was a “SEMI-SHOCK,” remarking that T. Rowe has focused mainly on mutual funds across its 87-year history. “Did not expect it but I get it,” Balchunas wrote. “There’s gonna be land rush for this space too.” However, T. Rowe Price has been signaling interest in crypto for a while now. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this year, Dominic Rizzo, who manages the company’s technology-focused ETF, suggested that now is a good time to consider Bitcoin exposure. He compared the crypto’s price to that of a commodity, saying it closely tracks the cost of mining it. Having long focused on mutual funds, T. Rowe Price’s foray into crypto ETFs comes after other legacy asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity had rushed to list such vehicles to overwhelming success. “Can’t overstate significance of T. Rowe Price filing for an actively managed crypto ETF out of left field,” President of NovaDius Wealth Management, Nate Geraci, posited. “A firm founded in 1937 is now building out the full infrastructure to handle crypto trading and manage a crypto ETF.” The T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF joins a growing list of over 155 crypto-related exchange-traded fund applications currently at the SEC’s desk. Most of these applications, including ones for Ripple’s XRP and Solana, are in limbo amid the US government shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day.

Today’s top news: 🏛️ Crypto Goes to Washington - And Gets Caught In the Middle The fight over U.S. crypto market structure has gotten fierce between the Democrats and Republicans. And the crypto industry is stuck in the middle. Senate Democrats reportedly told crypto industry leaders behind closed doors that Republicans have been “using” them politically, while both sides continue to battle over who controls the rules for digital assets. Blockworks reported that Democrat Senator Ruben Gallego told a room full of crypto executives this week: “Don’t be an arm of the Republican Party — they used you and your megaphones to f*** us.” The comment came during a tense Democratic roundtable with leaders from Coinbase, Solana, Ripple, and Paradigm, among others. On the same day, those same companies walked straight into a Republican meeting pitched as the real path to crypto legislation. Both sides are still saying they want a market structure bill, but the split is widening, and neither camp trusts the other. Here’s what the two sides are fighting over: The political risk for crypto is now obvious: if this turns into Red Team vs Blue Team, we don’t get clarity, and gridlock is likely. And the more that the Dems feel slighted in any regulatory frameworks approved under the Trump administration, the more they’ll try to claw those back if/when the balance of power shifts. Near term, the risks are lower scale—basically just delays. Longer term, the risks grow in magnitude the more political that crypto becomes (and the more it becomes aligned directly with the Trump family). This remains one of the single most important issues to monitor for crypto in America.

Title: Inside Steve Cohen's Cubist shake-up: How a quiet search and chance timing led to the surprising change at Point72

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To many inside Cubist Systematic Strategies — the roughly $7 billion quant division of Steve Cohen's hedge fund Point72 Asset Management — the ouster of president Denis Dancanet last month came as a shock. When Cohen's September 10 memo announcing the change landed, Dancanet had already begun preparing for year-end performance reviews, and scheduled meetings that day — including with job candidates — were abruptly canceled, according to people familiar with the matter. "People close to Denis were surprised," one of the people said. "Standard business was occurring." His big-name replacement, former WorldQuant Chief Investment Officer Geoffrey Lauprete, added to the curiosity. Lauprete had spent much of the past year laying the groundwork for an ambitious hedge fund launch of his own. Uncertainty loomed in the aftermath, with rumors of cuts and executive resignations swirling. The dust has started to clear in the six weeks since. In town halls and smaller meetings, Point72 leadership reaffirmed its commitment to its roster of 60 independent trading teams and the centralized investing unit that Dancanet built starting in 2020. "There are no plans to cut [portfolio managers] or investment teams — we remain focused on attracting great talent and growing Cubist," a Point72 spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. They declined to comment on Cubist's leadership changes. Dancanet also declined to comment. This week, Issam Bazzi, a key leader on the central team whose future has been the fixation of market chatter for weeks, signed a long-term contract extension after discussions with Cohen, Business Insider has learned. But what led to the surprising change at the top has remained murky. Cubist's performance had been strong during Dancanet's five-year run, and it remained positive in 2025 even after a short stint of summer losses that plagued the whole industry. If the shake-up felt sudden to some, that was by design. The announcement capped months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top deputies, who'd started to question whether Dancanet was the right person to lead Cubist, people with knowledge of the matter said. Point72 started a hush-hush search in early summer, auditioning candidates in a closely guarded process to avoid leaks and disruptions to the business, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The result wasn't a fait accompli. A series of converging events and chance timing culminated in one of the industry's most unanticipated leadership swaps. This story is based on conversations with more than a dozen people close to Cubist and Libero Capital, including current and former employees, allocators, and service providers. They requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on behalf of their companies or to protect client relationships. Fundamental stock picking is at the core of Cohen's Point72. But he's been involved in systematic trading for nearly as long as he's been running funds, hiring his first quant portfolio manager in 1994. After longtime Cubist head Ross Garon decamped for Izzy Englander's Millennium in 2020, Cohen brought in Dancanet, a veteran of the collaborative quant fund PDT — in large part to help realize a long-held desire to diversify from independent teams, or the so-called pod structure, and build a centralized systematic trading team in the mold of traditional powerhouse quant shops like PDT, Renaissance Technologies, or Two Sigma. "The difference compared to the pod model is that it's much more collaborative and there's open communication between the various teams across strategies," Dancanet explained in a 2023 blog post, which has since been scrubbed from the Point72 website. "The goal is to create a hybrid business structure combining the PM platform and the central team, which we feel would be unique for our industry." Dancanet was a cerebral, serene, and well-liked leader, according to those who've worked with him. He started on Wall Street in the mid-1990s after defecting from communist Romania in 1985. He joined Cubist after a four-year hiatus from quant trading, working on startups — one focused on flying cars and the other on applying data science to consumer lending. Dancanet immediately got to work building a centralized trading unit from scratch, an endeavor that, like any quant investment platform, would be expensive and take years to realize. Dancanet lured marquee hires, including former colleague Bazzi, from places like Citadel, Jump Trading, Squarepoint, and Tower Research. The road didn't lack bumps — the head of Cubist's high-frequency trading effort left after less than a year on the job — but the central group began trading and making money after a couple of years. It reached 100 people in 2025 and through mid-year had strong performance, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The other key part of Dancanet's job was something he lacked experience in: hiring PMs to run the independent pods Cubist is known for. Unlike hiring discretionary stock pickers, who can be up and running in days or weeks, bets on systematic PMs can take years to bear fruit as they assemble the necessary data and infrastructure, research and backtest strategies, and execute trading models. While returns at Cubist, which has doubled head count over the past three years, remained robust in the years after Dancanet joined, a pain point emerged with Cohen: Many of the PMs Dancanet brought in weren't moving the needle, according to people familiar with the matter. Cubist money managers who predated Dancanet generated a disproportionate amount of the returns, according to people familiar. Whether his leadership contributed to or improved the legacy PMs' performance is unclear, but Cohen wanted to see improvement on the disparity. While many PMs dislike micromanaging executives, Dancanet's more laissez-faire leadership style may have given Cohen and top deputies pause, insiders said. Dancanet's contract was up for renewal before the end of the year, and Cohen's team started to quietly explore alternatives. For Point72, Lauprete was a uniquely attractive candidate. At WorldQuant, he oversaw a massive centralized investment process, though the fund also has independent pods. Moreover, Lauprete, who left WorldQuant after 17 years in early 2024, wasn't bound by one of the lengthy noncompete clauses that often sideline quants for years, meaning he could start immediately — minimizing disruption at Cubist. The catch: He had spent considerable time and money preparing the launch of his own fund, Libero Capital. Lauprete initially secured Paloma Partners, the storied hedge fund founded by Donald Sussman in the 1980s, as an anchor investor. The relationship soured, and by April, according to Hedge Fund Alert, Lauprete and Paloma parted ways. Lauprete continued pitching investors through the spring and summer, drawing interest from firms including Engineers Gate, BlackRock, and Blackstone, people familiar said. (Representatives for those firms declined to comment.) He also held an initial meeting with Cubist, including Dancanet, in early summer about having Libero manage a slug of capital. But unbeknownst to Dancanet, discussions continued separately with Point72 leaders and evolved in scope. In early summer, Cubist — like most quant funds — was having a strong year. Systematic long-short funds were up double digits heading into June, according to a Goldman Sachs research report. The central team was profitable, and Dancanet aimed to eventually dedicate half of Cubist's capital to it, people familiar with his plan said. But then the steady, mysterious losses across the quantitative trading industry started to pile up, turning into a two-month bloodbath. Cubist experienced a severe drawdown, suffering its worst stretch since the COVID pandemic in early 2020, but recovered some of those losses, and year-to-date performance remained positive. Unlike setups at some rivals, Cubist isn't a stand-alone fund investors can allocate to with separately reported returns; its performance flows into Point72's overall returns. Point72 recorded gains in July and August and is up 9.7% through September. Point72's under-the-radar search for a potential Cubist successor continued. But while Libero was generating intrigue, capital commitments sufficient for its ambition weren't materializing, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Some investors were wary of the scale and associated costs of a large-scale quant launch as well as the autonomy Lauprete wanted, the people said. Lauprete, who was funding Libero out of his own pocket, was simultaneously interviewing with Point72 executives about the Cubist job, a process kept closely guarded to avoid leaks, one insider said. Dancanet and Cohen discussed contract extensions over the summer without coming to a conclusion. Then, over the first weekend in September, Lauprete and Cohen agreed to terms that would install Lauprete as Cubist president and move Libero under the unit's umbrella, people close to the firm said. Days later, Cohen sent out the memo announcing the leadership change. Cohen convened a short-notice virtual meeting with Cubist PMs the next day, one company insider said, reassuring them that he remained committed to both sides — the pods and the central team — of his hybrid vision for Cubist. Some industry insiders called it an opportunistic fit for both sides: a more seasoned leader for Cubist, and for Lauprete, a chance to land one of Wall Street's most coveted quant jobs while keeping Libero alive, which will join Cubist as an independent pod, people familiar said. He started the role at the beginning of October. The months and years ahead will reveal whether Cohen's leadership shake-up pays off — and whether Lauprete can deliver on the challenge of fusing Cubist's independent pods and central team ambitions into a single machine that churns out industry-beating returns.

Title: Fixed Income Assets Management Industry Report 2025: Strategic Insights and Forecasts to 2030, Emerging Trends and Growth Opportunities

October 23, 2025 04:44 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Fixed Income Assets Management - Global Strategic Business Report" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The global market for Fixed Income Assets Management was valued at US$26.5 Trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$36.9 Trillion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2024 to 2030. This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions.Fixed income assets management plays a pivotal role in ensuring stability and income generation in investment portfolios, particularly during periods of market volatility. Fixed income instruments, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and treasury securities, provide regular interest payments and principal protection, making them a reliable source of income for conservative investors. These assets are especially important in managing risk within diversified portfolios, as they typically perform inversely to equities during market downturns. Institutional investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, and wealth managers, heavily rely on fixed income management to meet their long-term financial obligations. In addition, the ability of fixed income strategies to generate consistent returns makes them appealing to retirees and income-focused investors.How Is the Fixed Income Market Segmented?Key asset types include government bonds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Each type offers different risk profiles, returns, and tax benefits. Issuers vary from government entities and municipalities to corporations, with sovereign bonds generally considered the safest due to their government backing. Geographically, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific lead in terms of market size, with emerging markets offering higher yields but carrying additional risks. Investment strategies are tailored to client needs, ranging from conservative income generation to more aggressive strategies that seek to capitalize on market opportunities in high-yield or emerging market debt.What Technological Advancements Are Impacting Fixed Income Assets Management?Technological innovations are transforming fixed income management by enhancing trade execution, portfolio management, and risk assessment. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms is enabling asset managers to analyze vast datasets, identify trends, and make more informed investment decisions. The adoption of electronic trading platforms has improved liquidity and transparency in bond markets, providing faster and more efficient trade execution. In addition, big data analytics are helping managers assess market risks more accurately, while fintech solutions are streamlining compliance and reporting processes.

Title: Ethereum Market Outlook: $4,100 Resistance Holds as BlackRock and Major Funds Boost Exposure

Time Published: 2025-10-23T06:00:33Z

After two weeks of a disappointing run, Ethereum (ETH) is once again capturing institutional interest as major funds and asset managers step into the smart-contract platform. According to recent data, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased approximately $251 million worth of ETH, adding 63,539 tokens to its portfolio and bringing its holdings to over 3 million ETH ($13 billion). BlackRock’s clients have added $41.91 million in Ethereum, marking another sign of growing institutional adoption. These inflows come as Ethereum breaks out of a descending trendline pattern and parallels the rally seen in gold, with ETH’s correlation to gold reaching 0.7 in Q3 2025, driven by ETF inflows and DeFi-driven growth. On-chain metrics further reinforce this accumulation narrative. Wallets are moving more ETH off exchanges, signaling long-term holding behavior, while tokenization and DeFi usage on Ethereum’s network continue to expand meaningfully. Institutions appear to be treating Ethereum not just as a speculative bet, but increasingly as a foundational infrastructure asset, particularly given Ethereum’s post-Proof-of-Stake upgrade energy efficiency and suitability for ESG mandates. From a technical vantage, Ethereum is testing the key resistance zone near $4,100–$4,440. Analysts like Ali Martinez point out the recent breakout of the descending trendline provides a bullish structural shift, but only if support levels remain intact. The most critical support lies near $3,800, with a deeper fallback to $3,600 if momentum fades. A sustained move above $4,440 could unlock a run toward $4,800–$5,000, provided institutional flows and macro conditions align. Conversely, a close below $3,800 would weaken the momentum thesis and potentially invite a retracement toward $3,560 or lower. With ETF flows, macro liquidity, and network fundamentals converging, Ethereum is showing a rare blend of structural strength, but execution is key. The near-term jury is out until Ethereum closes decisively above $4,100 with volume confirming the move.

Massive Job Displacement: Amazon plans to replace 600,000 workers with AI-driven robots, signaling a broader economic shift as China, Tesla, and Boston Dynamics accelerate automation, risking an $18 trillion consumer debt collapse. Economic Collapse Looms: Analysts predict hyperinflation, bank failures, and currency devaluation surpassing the 2008 crisis, with Universal Basic Income (UBI) failing to prevent homelessness and AI-driven governance sparking civil unrest. Vaccine Forensics Exposes Corruption: Brighteon.AI unveils an uncensored AI tool citing medical literature to expose Big Pharmaâs rigged trials, CDC/FDA collusion, and suppression of safer alternatives like natural immunity and detox protocols. Financial & Societal Breakdown: Gold, silver, and Bitcoin may be the only stable assets as fiat currencies hyperinflate, corporate landlords seize foreclosed homes, and AI-driven law enforcement enforces digital dystopia. Survival Strategies: Adams urges converting savings into gold/silver or crypto, avoiding UBI traps tied to compliance mandates, and building self-sufficient communities through off-grid homesteading and decentralized trade networks.

The Automation Tsunami Leaked documents confirm Amazonâs staggering plan to replace 600,000 human workers with AI-driven robots and autonomous systems within the next few yearsâa harbinger of a broader economic catastrophe. Analysts warn this trend, accelerated by Chinaâs mass-production of humanoid robots by 2025 and advancements from Tesla and Boston Dynamics, will trigger an $18 trillion consumer debt collapse as displaced workers default on mortgages, loans, and credit cards. The 2008 financial crisis will pale in comparison. Hyperinflation, bank failures, and currency devaluation loom as governments scramble to bail out institutions drowning in bad debt. Mike Adams, founder of Brighteon.com, warns of a "Mad Max 2030" scenarioâwhere Universal Basic Income (UBI) fails to offset skyrocketing costs, homelessness surges, and AI-driven governance replaces human institutions, sparking violent clashes between the jobless and the machines that replaced them. The AI Truth Wars Amidst the chaos, Brighteon.AI unveils a revolutionary tool: Vaccine Forensicsâan uncensored, citation-backed AI engine exposing Big Pharmaâs decades of deception on vaccines, mRNA technology, and regulatory capture. Unlike mainstream AI models prone to "hallucinating" sources, this system pulls direct excerpts from medical literature, historical documents, and peer-reviewed studies, proving: Pharmaceutical corruption and rigged clinical trials Suppression of safer alternatives (natural immunity, detox protocols) CDC/FDA collusion with industry lobbyists This tool empowers researchers to demand transparency in an era where informed consent is under siegeâwhile offline, decentralized models resist Big Tech manipulation. The Great Unraveling The convergence of AI-driven job eradication, financial collapse, and institutional distrust paints a dire forecast: Gold, silver, and Bitcoin may be the only stable assets as fiat currencies hyperinflate. Housing markets implode as corporate landlords (BlackRock) seize foreclosed properties. AI judges and cops enforce digital dystopia, while governments deploy robots to crush dissent. Medical truth remains a battleground, with alternative research tools like Vaccine Forensics offering a lifeline against censorship. Survival in the New Economy Adams urges proactive measures: Exit fiat currency: Convert savings into physical gold/silver or decentralized crypto. Prepare for UBI traps: Digital handouts will come with compliance mandates (vaccines, social credit). Build self-sufficient communities: Off-grid homesteading, permaculture, and decentralized trade networks. Conclusion The storm is here. The globalist agendaâdepopulation, digital enslavement, and AI-driven controlâis accelerating. But tools like Brighteon.AI and grassroots resilience offer a path to truth, freedom, and survival. As Adams warns: "When people lose everything, they lose it." The time to act is now.

Title: The Great Democratization: Why Your Pension Deserves Bitcoin

For decades, the investment elite have enjoyed a secret: alternative assets deliver superior returns. While ordinary Americans watched their 401(k)s stagnate in index funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds quietly reaped gains from private equity, venture capital, and—lately—digital assets. President Trump’s Executive Order 14330, “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” (Aug. 7, 2025), finally tears down that wall, giving working Americans the same opportunities long hoarded by the wealthy. Leveling the Field The reform works on three levels: federal directive, state legislation, and congressional codification. At the federal level, Trump’s order directed the Department of Labor to lift Biden-era restrictions that effectively banned cryptocurrencies from retirement accounts under the guise of “extreme care.” States responded swiftly. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas legalized modest Bitcoin allocations in early 2025. North Carolina proposed allowing up to five percent of its $127 billion retirement fund—$6.35 billion—to flow into Bitcoin ETFs. Michigan already holds $11.4 million in Bitcoin exposure, and Wisconsin disclosed $164 million in spot ETF holdings. Florida’s House Bill 183, filed for the 2026 session, is the boldest initiative yet. It would authorize the State CFO to invest up to 10 percent of public funds—including the $218 billion Florida Retirement System Trust Fund—in digital assets. Even a 1 percent allocation would add $2.2 billion to Bitcoin markets; 5 percent would exceed $11 billion. The bill imposes strict custody and compliance requirements, limiting holdings to qualified custodians or SEC-registered ETFs. It cites Trump’s earlier Executive Order 14233 establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, defining Bitcoin as a store of value and inflation hedge. In Congress, Rep. Troy Downing’s Retirement Investment Choice Act seeks to codify the reform permanently, shielding it from future reversals. Senate Republicans are pressing for regulatory safe harbors to protect plan sponsors. Critics decry “speculation,” ignoring that institutions have owned crypto for years. Harvard, Yale, and Stanford invested in digital assets long ago; Michigan and Wisconsin pension funds now follow. The paternalism that deems Harvard’s allocation “prudent” but a Kentucky teacher’s “reckless” is indefensible. Oklahoma lawmakers estimated that a five-percent Bitcoin allocation would have yielded $750 million in just five months—reducing pension liabilities without costing taxpayers. Macroeconomic Realism The macro case is simple: the old rules no longer apply. The 60/40 stock-bond portfolio worked when inflation was tame and rates predictable. Since Nixon abandoned gold in 1971, the dollar has lost nearly 90 percent of its purchasing power. Pension funds invested solely in dollar assets are slowly boiling away their value. Bitcoin offers scarcity and independence from central banks. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins provides what fiat currency cannot—certainty against dilution. While the Fed prints trillions, no government can mint more Bitcoin. For funds managing decades of liabilities, that scarcity is protection. Since 2015, Bitcoin has appreciated over 15,000 percent. Even accounting for volatility, its risk-adjusted returns beat every traditional asset over ten years. With BlackRock, Fidelity, and other giants now offering Bitcoin products, the real question is why ordinary savers were barred from this asset class for so long. Monetary Sovereignty and Stability Cryptocurrency is not rebellion but evolution. The Fed’s monopoly on money creation produced asset bubbles, the 2008 crisis, and inflation that punishes savers. Bitcoin provides a decentralized system where no bureaucracy can rewrite the rules. For pensions, diversification across uncorrelated assets enhances stability. Bitcoin’s movements have low correlation with equities, particularly during inflation shocks. When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often rises—the hedge long-term portfolios need. The 2022 “crypto winter,” endlessly cited by skeptics, was followed by a recovery that rewarded patient holders. Pension funds, with multi-decade horizons, are ideally suited to absorb short-term volatility. Integrating crypto also secures America’s leadership in digital finance. China has its digital yuan; Europe experiments with a digital euro. If U.S. pensions remain confined to 20th-century assets while others advance on blockchain rails, America risks obsolescence. Trump’s order ensures American savers, not foreign innovators, benefit from U.S. financial ingenuity. The Geopolitical Dimension The dollar’s supremacy is not eternal. Its strength rests on faith in U.S. institutions and the dollar’s global utility. Endless deficits and monetary expansion corrode both. Bitcoin, a neutral and borderless asset, is becoming a global reserve hedge. Far from undermining American power, adopting Bitcoin reinforces it. The U.S. still commands the deepest capital markets and most advanced financial infrastructure. Keeping Bitcoin innovation under American jurisdiction ensures it strengthens, not weakens, the national system. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mirrors the role gold once played at Fort Knox: a signal of monetary credibility in the digital age. Vermont’s proposed ban on pension crypto holdings shows the opposite impulse—fear masquerading as prudence. Dismissing Bitcoin as “too young” recalls those who once said the same about equities or the internet. Pension funds that avoided technology stocks in the 1990s underperformed disastrously; those that shun digital assets now will repeat the mistake. The Path Forward Trump’s order does not compel investment; it restores fiduciary discretion. The three-tier system—federal deregulation, state empowerment, congressional codification—forms a durable structure resistant to political shifts. Florida’s plan exemplifies best practice: a 10 percent ceiling, strict custody rules, ETF channels, and explicit recognition of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. As Brian Graff of the American Retirement Association notes, “Professional fiduciaries—not the federal government—are best placed to decide what serves participants’ interests.” Maintaining the status quo is the true recklessness. States like Kentucky and Oklahoma face massive pension shortfalls. With traditional assets underperforming, fiduciaries must seek alternatives. Crypto offers return, diversification, and protection against monetary debasement—the very goals of responsible investment. Volatility fears are outdated. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity have stabilized markets, and Bitcoin’s swings have narrowed as liquidity deepens. For pensions with long horizons, near-term fluctuations are noise; long-term appreciation is the signal. The democratization of alternative assets is overdue justice. For too long, working Americans were excluded from wealth-building strategies reserved for elites. Trump’s reforms end this financial apartheid. Every worker deserves access to the same instruments that enriched universities and sovereign funds. If pension funds buying Bitcoin seems radical, the real radicalism was denying citizens the chance to protect their savings. In an age of monetary erosion, Bitcoin is not speculation—it is self-defense. Extending that protection to every American is what democratic capitalism should mean. Fortune favors the brave; poverty rewards the timid. Bepi Pezzulli is a Solicitor in England & Wales and an Avvocato in Italy. He is a foreign-policy scholar, a member of Advance UK’s College, and a councillor of the Great British PAC. He tweets @bepipezzulli. Image: Free image, Pixabay license.

Rowe Price on Wednesday applied for a mixed digital asset exchange-traded fund, according to a regulatory filing, its first in the crypto space as it joined a growing list of traditional finance firms that have proposed token-focused products. The Baltimore-based firm, which manages $1.77 trillion in assets, said that the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF would hold five to 15 digital assets, including potentially Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Hedera, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Litecoin, and Polkadot, according to its S-1 prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest digital coins by market cap, will have the biggest weighting, according to the application. SEMI-SHOCK: T Rowe Price just filed for an Active Crypto ETF. They are a Top 5 active manager by assets (mostly mutual funds). Did not expect it but I get it. There’s gonna be land rush for this space too. pic.twitter.com/gXbCsll9kG — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 22, 2025 "Under normal circumstances, the Fund is expected to hold between five and fifteen crypto assets; however, the Fund may hold more than fifteen or less than five crypto assets at any time," the filing said, adding that the ETF would try to outperform the FTSE Crypto U.S. Listed Index. The application comes as traditional finance firms look to expand their digital asset fund offerings to meet soaring investor demand, a result of the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds that debuted last year and a friendlier regulatory and political environment. Fidelity, VanEck and ProShares have all proposed Solana funds. This week, ProShares also submitted a proposal for a mixed digital coin fund. Several crypto-focused asset managers are also looking to list ETFs based on altcoins. The SEC is currently weighing more than 90 applications for crypto-focused ETFs. T. Rowe Price told Decrypt that it could not provide information aside from what was in the filing. In January 2024, the SEC approved a slew of Bitcoin ETFs, including funds proposed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The funds have had the most successful start in the ETF industry's 32-year history and now manage over $150.3 billion in assets. Ethereum funds, approved later in the year, now control about $23 billion in assets, most of those coming in the last four months. The funds have given more traditional investors and some institutions access to the world of crypto via shares that trade on a stock exchange. Previously, investors were discouraged by some aspects of buying digital assets, such as storing digital coins and paying tax on gains.

The 54-page analysis paints an optimistic picture of crypto's trajectory, emphasizing 2025 as the pivotal year for institutional embrace while highlighting surging user growth, technological advancements, and regulatory progress in the U.S. "This is the year the world came on-chain," the authors wrote. With Bitcoin dominating over half the cryptocurrency market cap and stablecoins rivaling global payment giants like Visa in transaction volume, the report argues that crypto is anchoring the modern economy—yet it warns that challenges like privacy, scalability, and AI integration must be addressed to unlock its full potential. That optimism isn't unexpected: Andreessen Horowitz is Silicon Valley's biggest booster, having raised more than $7.6 billion across four funds earmarked for crypto. At the heart of the report is the assertion that crypto's market is "big, global, and growing," driven by cyclical feedback loops between rising prices, developer activity, and user adoption. The total crypto market capitalization has seen dramatic ups and downs, but recently topped $4 billion for the first time ever. And underlying metrics show resilience: monthly active developers have climbed to over 40,000, while mobile wallet users approach 60 million. Bitcoin remains king, holding more than 50% of the global crypto market cap and ranking among top global assets—its value now surpasses companies like Meta and Saudi Aramco, though gold's market cap is still 11 times larger. The report notes Bitcoin's increasing correlation with macro forces, behaving at times like a safe haven (similar to gold) and at others like a risk asset (tracking the Nasdaq). In the report, Andreessen Horowitz dubbed 2025 "the year of institutional adoption." Major financial players are diving in: Circle's market cap exceeded $50 billion earlier this year after a splashy IPO, Robinhood launched its own Arbitrum-based layer-2 blockchain, BlackRock continued expanding its tokenized money-market fund, and Fidelity started testing its own USD-pegged stablecoin. Traditional giants like Stripe, Visa, PayPal, Mastercard, Shopify, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley are integrating crypto features, from stablecoin payments to tokenized assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs alone hold over $170 billion in on-chain assets, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust holding over $91 billion worth of BTC as of this writing. Meanwhile, publicly traded "treasury companies" now hold billions in crypto reserves—led by Bitcoin giant Strategy with $69 million—signaling a shift toward treating digital assets as core balance-sheet items. Stablecoins emerged as a breakout star, having "gone mainstream" with adjusted transaction volumes hitting $9 trillion over the past year—gaining on ACH ($87 trillion) while dwarfing PayPal ($1.7 trillion). Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC dominate stablecoin supply, primarily on Ethereum and Tron, and stablecoin issuers now rank among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries, ahead of nations like Saudi Arabia and Germany. The report posits that stablecoins could bolster USD dominance amid rising national debt and declining foreign demand for Treasuries, with organic adoption decoupling from speculative trading. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is expanding, capturing 25% of spot trading volume as users shift from centralized exchanges (CEXs) to decentralized ones (DEXs). Real-world assets (RWAs) like tokenized Treasuries and corporate bonds have reached $30 billion on-chain, bridging traditional finance. Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) plays are also gaining steam, with projects like Helium generating revenue through user-owned wireless services. Meme coins, with over 13 million different tokens launched in the past year, are framed as a symptom of regulatory gaps, while NFTs evolve from speculation to broad collecting on low-fee chains. Prediction markets, buoyed by post-election traction, are "here to stay," the report claims. The report claimed that crypto infrastructure is "(almost) ready for prime time," processing over 3,400 transactions per second—approaching scales of Nasdaq or credit card networks. Solana stands out as a hub for economic activity, with rising throughput and billions in app revenue, while Ethereum's layer-2 upgrades have driven record volumes at all-time-low fees. Bridges are funneling billions to more robust chains, and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs are accelerating privacy and scaling. Blockchains are also preparing for quantum threats, with 6.65 million Bitcoin ($717 billion) still at risk from vulnerable addresses. A key convergence is between AI and crypto, with the report arguing that crypto can solve AI's pain points: proving human uniqueness (over 17 million verified on World), enabling agent payments ($30 trillion projected AI-influenced purchases by 2030), tracking IP provenance ($80 trillion in intangible assets), and decentralizing compute (over 420,000 models on Gensyn's network). Since ChatGPT's launch, crypto has seen a talent exodus to AI but net gains from other sectors, fueling a wave of "AI x crypto" startups—now representing 30% of crypto VC deals. AI's power consolidation in Big Tech underscores the need for crypto's decentralization. AI needs identity, payments, and provenance tracking. Crypto provides all three. Together, crypto & AI are shaping a more open internet—one where both money and intelligence move freely. pic.twitter.com/slZvgB0ruj — a16z crypto (@a16zcrypto) October 22, 2025 In America, the industry is "stronger than ever," the firm wrote, thanks to advancing legislation like the GENIUS Act—which President Trump signed into law in July with bipartisan support—and the pending CLARITY Act. Federal agencies are being proactive, too: the DOJ revised crypto prosecution policies, the CFTC clarified that code isn't a crime, and the SEC issued guidance on stablecoins and ETFs. This environment enables tokens to capture revenue directly for holders, the report suggests, closing economic loops with $33 billion in user-paid fees generating $18 billion for projects and $4 billion accruing to tokens. Looking ahead, Andreessen Horowitz forecasts market structure as top policy priority, accelerated stablecoin use strengthening USD, traditional finance doubling down on-chain, infrastructure breakthroughs, and revenue-generating tokens. It also projects AI-crypto innovations addressing internet challenges, a surge in tokenized real-world assets, clearer regulations unlocking developer opportunities, and consumer products onboarding the next wave of users.

Title: T. Rowe Is Aiming to Beat an Index of Investments — in Crypto

T. Rowe Price's actively managed ETF would invest in a “diversified basket of commodity crypto assets,” according to regulatory filings. October 22, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is planning to launch its first cryptocurrency fund, a bold move for the mutual-fund giant that mostly trades in traditional stocks and bonds. The actively managed exchange-traded fund would invest in a “diversified basket of commodity crypto assets,” according to a Wednesday filing. T. Rowe’s managers will aim to beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index, which is meant to include the top ten crypto assets by market capitalization. Digital assets have become a major windfall for some of the industry’s largest fund managers, including BlackRock Inc., whose two-year-old spot-Bitcoin ETF now has about $90 billion in client assets. Fidelity Investments’ Bitcoin ETF has about $23 billion. President Donald Trump’s support for cryptocurrencies has driven more finance firms to expand in the market. Earlier this month, CME Group Inc. said it will enable round-the-clock trading of cryptocurrency futures and options from early next year. A spokesperson for T. Rowe said the firm has closely monitored developments in the market and has also developed end-to-end capabilities to trade digital assets. The company didn’t disclose a fee on its new fund, which is subject to regulatory approval. “This is all about crypto moving onto the traditional rails of asset management,” said Todd Sohn, a senior ETF strategist at Strategas. Related:10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Oct. 21, 2025) For T. Rowe — which oversees $1.8 trillion — the ETF is another push from the firm to lure in more money after struggling with client redemptions from its actively managed stock and bond funds. The Baltimore-based firm has also been trying to expand in other asset classes with deals and new products. In 2021, T. Rowe bought private credit firm Oak Hill Advisors. This year, the company partnered with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to sell private-market products to retail investors.

Ever since AI supplanted crypto as the shiny new toy in Silicon Valley, there’s been no shortage of jokes about workers jumping ship. New data from prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (commonly referred to as a16z) shows that the truth is more complicated. In its annual state of crypto report released on Wednesday, a16z found that since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, around 1,000 workers left the crypto industry for AI startups. But, in that same time period, blockchain companies gained the same number of employees from other industries, including traditional finance and tech. “People forget that the collapse of FTX and the launch of ChatGPT were less than a month apart”, said Daren Matsuoka, a partner on the crypto investment team at a16z, in an interview with Fortune. “There was a period of time in the crypto industry where it was looking very negative for crypto and very promising for AI.” Today, the outlook for crypto is markedly different than it was in late 2022. AI continues to drive record investment, but crypto has mounted a comeback. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies in circulation has surpassed $4 trillion, and Bitcoin’s value hit new all-time highs this year. The resurgence comes as the Trump administration embraced the sector, pushing for a regulatory thaw and championing legislation in Congress to establish oversight for stablecoins and exchanges. Top financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity are all expanding their crypto offerings. In its report, a16z found that workers coming into the crypto industry are tending to join from a traditional finance and consulting background, or from emerging fintech companies, another sign that the line is blurring between traditional finance and crypto. “We started doing this report four years ago, when crypto was in its teenage years,” Matsuoka added. “But now the world takes crypto seriously… the industry just got a lot more mature.” This year’s crypto annual crypto report is the fourth of its kind to be published by a16z, which spun out its crypto arm in 2018. Following the spin-off, the entity known as a16z crypto raised staggering funds during an earlier boom era for blockchain, including a $2.2 billion vehicle in 2021 and a $4.5 billion fund in 2022. Led by Chris Dixon, a16z crypto has invested in top startups such as Worldcoin, Uniswap, and Phantom. While the soaring AI industry has dominated tech headlines, a16z crypto’s new report shows that crypto users’ desire for privacy is becoming more pronounced. The firm cites Google searches related to crypto privacy surging in 2025. “It’s a common trope in the industry for people to say users don’t really care about privacy”, said Eddy Lazzarin, a16z crypto’s chief technology officer, in an interview with Fortune. “I personally don’t think that that’s true. I think that people either do or will care.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: $8.3B real world assets now on-chain: Can tokenization make banks top crypto custodians?

Banks once shunned crypto custody; now they’re racing to tokenize trillions in cash and securities. The quiet rebuild is underway, and it’s happening inside the balance sheets of Goldman, Citi, and BlackRock. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Wall Street’s biggest balance sheets are quietly rebuilding the crypto stack under the banner of tokenization and custody. What began as a defensive stance toward digital assets is turning into an infrastructure shift: bringing fund administration, cash management, and settlement onto blockchain rails that look more like BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect platform than a typical crypto exchange. Since late summer, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have taken tokenized money market funds live, Citi has positioned itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange, and BlackRock has doubled down on the thesis that tokenized funds will eventually sit beside ETFs as a core product line. In the span of a few months, tokenized treasuries have become an $8.3 billion asset class. Broader real-world assets (RWAs) now range between $24 and $30 billion. Yet the real contest isn’t in the numbers; it’s in who will custody the next $100 billion of digital paper and how those assets connect to traditional balance sheets. The first wave of bank entries shows a clear pattern. Goldman and BNY chose the least volatile and most systemically relevant asset they could: money market funds. Money market funds are among the safest and most liquid investment vehicles in traditional finance. They hold short-term government and corporate debt, giving institutions a way to park cash while earning modest yields with minimal risk. Tokenizing them turns those holdings into digital units that can be transferred instantly and settled 24 hours a day. For large institutions, the benefit is not speculative but operational: corporate treasurers can move cash faster, pledge assets as collateral, and reduce the frictions that come with banking cut-off times. Citi’s strategy moves in parallel through private markets. By joining SDX, Citi now provides custody and tokenization services for regulated digital securities, acting as the back-end for issuers experimenting with tokenized bonds or shares. The structure resembles traditional custody, but settlement happens atomically, meaning payment and asset transfer occur simultaneously without intermediaries. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund demonstrates how this can scale. The fund holds tokenized Treasury bills and represents them as programmable tokens. Its assets have grown more than eightfold in 18 months. With total assets at $13.5 trillion and nearly $100 billion of crypto-linked funds, BlackRock has the reach to turn tokenized products into standard portfolio components for institutions. If the early 2020s were about crypto custodians learning compliance, the mid-2020s are about banks learning blockchain. The players are different, but the economics are familiar. Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY already charge custody fees of roughly 0.05% to 0.15% of the value they hold, depending on client size and risk profile. As tokenized cash and securities become mainstream, these percentages start to resemble the fees charged in fund administration and collateral management, creating an overlap that did not exist before. In this version of tokenization, the appeal is not headline innovation but efficiency. A tokenized Treasury or fund share can move instantly between accounts and settle in real time, cutting costs for both clients and custodians. The conservative outlook for this market sees tokenized Treasuries hovering between $6 billion and $8 billion if regulation slows and yields fall. A middle-ground projection expects around $10-15 billion by mid-2026 as more banks integrate money-market products. The optimistic scenario reaches $25-40 billion if tokenized cash accounts tied to ETFs take off and if banks start testing repo markets for tokenized collateral. Repos are the backbone of short-term lending in finance. Banks lend cash in exchange for safe collateral such as Treasuries, agreeing to reverse the trade later. Tokenized repos would allow these transactions to settle automatically on a blockchain, reducing the operational delays and counterparty risk that currently require expensive intermediaries. That collateral link is what turns tokenization from a bookkeeping experiment into real financial plumbing. Goldman and BNY’s tokenized money-market shares already move within closed, permissioned environments. The next question is whether those tokens can move across custodians safely. The joint Project Guardian initiative between the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Singapore’s Monetary Authority is testing that exact idea: shared standards for verifying compliance across public and private blockchains. If the project succeeds, 2026 could bring the first bank-to-bank repo transactions executed entirely with tokenized assets. Today’s systems still operate inside walled gardens. Networks such as Goldman’s GS DAP, SDX, and JPMorgan’s Onyx offer efficiency at the cost of interoperability. Regulators prefer this model because every participant is known and verified, but financial institutions are beginning to explore how permissioned systems might connect to public networks through cryptographic proofs that preserve compliance. If that link is established, custody fees could expand toward $300–600 million in annual revenue, assuming tokenized cash and Treasury products reach $25–40 billion in assets and charge service fees near 0.1–0.15%. Regulation will decide how fast this happens. In Europe, MiCA has introduced uniform rules for custodians and crypto-asset service providers, known as CASPs. These rules define how digital assets must be segregated, safeguarded, and reported, allowing banks to passport tokenized funds across the European Economic Area without facing different national requirements. The UK and Singapore are building similar frameworks through Project Guardian to standardize tokenization in asset and wealth management. In the US, the obstacle is accounting treatment. Under the now-revised Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, or SAB 121, banks holding crypto for clients had to record those assets on their balance sheets as liabilities. That made large-scale custody uneconomical for systemically important banks, also known as G-SIBs. If future guidance removes that burden, these banks could hold tokenized assets without incurring punitive capital requirements, unlocking the full balance-sheet potential of tokenization. Until then, the firms already embedded in ETF custody, Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY, retain a practical advantage. Coinbase’s $246 billion in assets under custody shows how much flow still runs through crypto-native infrastructure. Yet the gravitational pull of regulated fund structures is increasing. As tokenized Treasuries and money-market products scale, the operational logic of banking begins to merge with blockchain’s settlement mechanics. Money-market tokens may sound like plumbing, but plumbing determines who controls the flow of funds. In this race, the flow is not just digital assets but the future structure of the balance sheet itself.

Title: U.K.’s FCA sues Justin Sun-linked exchange for unlawful promotions

Time Published: 2025-10-22T18:50:29Z
Full Content:
The FCA has taken legal action against HTX, formerly Huobi Global, alleging it unlawfully promoted crypto services to UK consumers. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority is accusing Justin Sun-linked exchange HTX of promoting crypto services without proper authorization. The lawsuit demonstrates a welcome of regulated products, while cracking down on offshore exchanges that violate promotion laws. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority [FCA] has filed a civil lawsuit against crypto exchange HTX, formerly Huobi Global. It accused it of unlawfully marketing digital-asset services to U.K. consumers without authorization. The case, lodged in London’s High Court, targets HTX. Also, it targets its predecessor entity Huobi Global, and four unnamed individuals connected to the exchange’s promotional operations. The FCA stated that the exchange breached the country’s financial promotions regime by offering crypto services without meeting requirements. The FCA stated, according to a Financial Times report, that firms operating outside the U.K. but promoting crypto services to British consumers are still subject to the U.K.’s financial promotion rules. “We will not hesitate to act where firms flout the law or put UK investors at risk,” an FCA spokesperson told reporters. HTX already appears on the FCA’s warning list, which alerts the public to firms “not authorized and likely to be operating illegally.” Market observers are describing the new case as a test of jurisdiction for U.K. authorities seeking to rein in global exchanges marketing to domestic users. The lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal challenges linked to Justin Sun, HTX’s de facto owner and founder of the Tron Network. In March 2023, the U.S. SEC charged Sun and the Tron Foundation for allegedly selling unregistered securities and orchestrating wash trades in TRX and BTT. That case remains open, although court filings indicate that both parties are exploring a potential settlement. Sun has also faced scrutiny over governance concerns, with reports alleging he controls the majority of TRX’s circulating supply. The U.K. action could widen regulatory pressure on Sun-associated firms. HTX’s integration with Tron-based assets and Sun’s recent efforts to expand HTX’s global footprint have kept his empire in regulators’ crosshairs. The lawsuit comes amid sweeping regulatory changes in the U.K. Earlier this month, the U.K. lifted its ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded products [ETPs]. This allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs from firms such as BlackRock and WisdomTree to list on the London Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is preparing new stablecoin rules, signalling a broader tightening of oversight even as the country opens to institutional crypto investment.

Title: Hollywood’s Next Financier: You

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Hollywood has hit a breaking point. Audiences are fatigued by franchise sequels and reboots. YouTube has overtaken Disney as the world’s largest distributor. And Gen AI tools like Sora 2 can soon turn anyone into a filmmaker. Yet one thing hasn’t changed: how films get financed. And that’s why we keep getting fewer original films. Decline of original screenplays at the US box office (1984-2023) Source: The Numbers and Box Office Mojo For decades, filmmakers have had only two ways to raise capital: courting wealthy “patrons of the arts” or signing away IP in restrictive studio deals. These small circles still control who the next David Lynch will be, or which film becomes the next Napoleon Dynamite, while everyday fans — the people who live and breathe these films — have never had a seat at the table. (Fewer than 1% of Americans meet SEC “accreditation” standards to invest in most private ventures, including film.) That’s finally changing, thanks to tokenization. The promise of "decentralization in film” has arrived, quietly and legally this time. A few years ago, “Web3 Film” had the right dream but the wrong tools: people were slicing films into NFT frames, touting complex tokenomics and skirting securities laws. None of it worked. Projects like Stoner Cats, Ashton Kutcher’s NFT cartoon, became cautionary tales after the SEC cracked down for selling unregistered securities to unaccredited investors. Today, the difference is compliance. Through licensed platforms operating under SEC exemptions such as Reg CF, production companies can take on thousands of unaccredited investors (even in the U.S.) to back real film projects and share in the upside. Security tokens issued on blockchain rails make it possible to distribute dividends transparently and cost-effectively — and, eventually, trade investors’ stakes on secondary markets. And it’s already working. Tens of thousands of investors have contributed more than $30 million to premium productions from some of Hollywood’s most respected names. This year, Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids) raised $2 million from 2,000 fans to invest in new action films — and every investor got to pitch him a film as part of the slate. Pressman Film — the company behind American Psycho, Wall Street and The Crow — raised $2 million for a slate of bold, original films, and is already starting to return capital within six months. And Eli Roth (Hostel, Inglorious Basterds) launched a fan-owned horror studio that maxed out its $5 million Reg CF campaign in July. He was tired of studios deeming his ideas too gory, even though the most profitable film of 2024 was the unrated slasher, Terrifier 3. Tokenized fan investing is opening up new paths for capital and creativity. Filmmakers can now tap their audiences for capital instead of taking the studio deal, allowing them to retain more ownership of their IP and take creative risks without interference from the suits or the algorithm. For fans, tokenization opens up access to a previously inaccessible opportunity: investing in film as an alternative asset class. Ultimately, these projects tend to perform better — not just creatively but financially — as audiences with skin in the game drive buzz and box-office returns. The timing couldn’t be better. With IPOs slowing and private markets swelling, tokenization is unlocking billions in household capital and opening doors to previously gatekept opportunities across private credit, venture capital and now, film. The GENIUS Act has brought long-awaited regulatory clarity to digital assets, while institutions from BlackRock to Visa are embedding blockchain infrastructure into the mainstream economy. Tokenization has quietly graduated from crypto casino to financial plumbing, and entertainment is proving to be one of its most relatable (and needed) use cases. There may be no better Trojan horse for mainstream adoption of tokenization than culture real-world assets (RWAs). Few industries are as ripe for disruption as film, and none as universally relatable, considering nearly all of us end our day watching Netflix (and then complain about the content). But when the audience can invest in the projects they want to see, whether from established filmmakers or up-and-coming creators, we won’t just get new financing models. We’ll get better movies.

Title: Andreessen Horowitz Says Crypto Has Entered a ‘New Era’ of Real Utility

Crypto’s future is starting to look more like a global financial system and less like a speculative playground, according to Andreessen Horowitz. In its State of Crypto 2025 report, a16z analysts argue that the industry has entered a new era shaped by infrastructure upgrades, regulatory clarity and deeper ties with traditional finance. Among the most important trends for the coming year: stablecoin growth, real-world assets moving onchain, and new intersections with artificial intelligence (AI). Stablecoins, which enable fast and cheap dollar transfers, are seeing wide adoption from institutions like Visa, Citi and PayPal. Visa said it sees strong demand in volatile emerging markets and cross-border payments. According to a16z, stablecoins handled $46 trillion in transactions over the past year — more than double PayPal — and now rival major networks like ACH and Visa. They’re also becoming major U.S. Treasury holders, surpassing countries like South Korea and Germany. As regulatory efforts in the U.S. gain traction, stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s global position. Legislation around market structure is expected to be a top priority in 2025, giving companies a clearer framework to launch products and onboard users. Institutional momentum is picking up too. BlackRock and JPMorgan are building crypto partnerships, while Morgan Stanley plans to offer crypto trading on E*TRADE starting at the beginning of 2025. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin BTC$110,311.81 and ethereum ETH$3,890.99 now hold over $175 billion combined, signaling a shift from fringe asset to portfolio staple. Meanwhile, a quiet infrastructure revolution is underway. Ethereum upgrades and the rise of Solana have pushed blockchain transaction speeds to over 3,400 per second — closing in on the scale of credit card networks. These technical improvements, along with new privacy tools like zero-knowledge proofs and preparations for quantum-resistant encryption, are making blockchains more usable and secure. Real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries, commodities and equity instruments are beginning to move onchain, with $30 billion already tokenized. This shift could rewire how capital markets operate by creating more efficient settlement layers and round-the-clock liquidity. AI is also becoming part of the equation. Developers are exploring how crypto tools like decentralized infrastructure and smart contracts can check the growing concentration of power in big tech's hands. Though crypto has lost some engineering talent to AI startups, it's also pulling new entrants from adjacent industries. Finally, developers are starting to focus more on revenue-generating products. Projects brought in $18 billion last year, and about $4 billion of that flowed directly to tokenholders — hinting at a maturing business model that rewards users and investors alike. As user numbers reach up to 70 million, a16z expects consumer apps to drive the next wave of growth. The report paints a picture of crypto not as a trend but as a long-term platform — one that’s finally finding its footing in the mainstream economy.

Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was first reported missing, has retired to consider its verdicts. Luke Taylor, aged 28, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork, have both pleaded not guilty to the murder of Kieran Quilligan. The murder count which each man denies states that on a date unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the District Court area of Cork City he did murder 47-year-old Kieran Quilligan contrary to Common Law. Before the jury began their deliberations this afternoon, Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford told the two women and 10 men that they are dealing with two seperate trials and the verdict in respect of one of the defendants could be different to the verdict on the other, if the jury so decided. Ms Justice Lankford said their verdicts had to be unaminous. She said there are three verdicts open to the jury in respect of each defendant. They can find him guilty of murder, not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His skeletal remains were found on scrub land near Midleton on 29 January 2024, almost five months later. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: APT price soars as BlackRock’s BUIDL fund expands to Aptos

Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:46:05Z

The APT price is showing renewed strength as Aptos gains major institutional backing from global giants like BlackRock and Jump Crypto. After dipping to a yearly low earlier this month, Aptos has staged an impressive comeback, fueled by real-world asset tokenisation and enterprise-grade innovation across its ecosystem. Aptos has outperformed a sluggish crypto market, gaining around 5% in the past 24 hours to trade near $3.32. This sharp rebound follows BlackRock’s expansion of its Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Aptos blockchain, a move that has injected $500 million worth of tokenised Treasuries into the network. 🚨 $500M more of @BlackRock's BUIDL just landed on Aptos. This pushes Aptos back into the Top 3 in RWAs, with $1.2B+ tokenized assets on-chain. And now, we're #2 in BUIDL adoption. Institutions are choosing Aptos, the chain to move what matters. pic.twitter.com/vT3jfZYmPb — Aptos (@Aptos) October 21, 2025 The deployment of BUIDL has pushed Aptos into the top tier of real-world asset (RWA) blockchains, sitting just behind Ethereum and zkSync Era. Data shows that more than $1.2 billion in RWAs are now tokenised on Aptos, a milestone that marks growing trust from traditional finance. Notably, BlackRock’s involvement brings not only prestige but also liquidity and credibility to the network. In parallel, Jump Crypto has launched Shelby, a decentralised, high-performance storage layer developed in collaboration with Aptos Labs. Storage is the missing layer. Blockchains run fast. Oracles work. Messages move across chains. But without high performance storage, real execution stays centralized. We're building Shelby with @AptosLabs to fix that.https://t.co/VFtuFRQp4P — Jump Crypto 🔥💃🏻 (@jump_) October 21, 2025 Designed to rival traditional cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud, Shelby enables sub-second latency, low-cost reads and writes, and improved scalability. Its architecture reduces redundancy while maintaining high data durability through erasure coding. The new system could become a backbone for decentralised applications that require real-time data access and high-speed processing. By combining Aptos’s parallel execution engine and Move programming language with Shelby’s efficient data design, the two firms aim to create infrastructure suited for enterprise and AI-driven decentralised finance (DeFi). This blend of performance and programmability is helping Aptos carve a niche in a crowded Layer-1 field. As institutional adoption accelerates and on-chain liquidity grows, the Aptos price could continue to benefit from renewed investor confidence. While short-term volatility remains, the network’s long-term fundamentals appear stronger than ever — anchored by innovation, partnerships, and a clear path toward real-world integration. The Aptos price is currently testing resistance near $3.50 after rebounding from a recent low of $2.22. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with moving averages flashing multiple sell alerts, although oscillators remain neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 34, suggesting mild accumulation. If APT breaks above $3.50, it could extend gains toward $3.85. However, failure to maintain current momentum could see the token slip toward $3.00 or even retest its earlier lows. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have noted that APT remains at one of its lowest valuations in years, hinting at potential upside if broader market sentiment improves.

Title: Blockbuster $40b AI Investment Is Only 10% of What’s Coming (NVDA, MSFT, META, BLK)

Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:29:17Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

Title: The M&A Curse of Warner Bros. Discovery | Analysis
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/the-ma-curse-of-warner-bros-discovery-analysis/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T13:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members WBD is officially in play. Can CEO David Zaslav do right by his shareholders after three-plus years of holding a declining stock? Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was undergoing a “strategic review” on Tuesday after the company said it is fielding “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. Its stock popped 11% on the news. But mergers have generally not been kind to the company that started out as Warner Brothers in 1923, including what history will record as one of the worst mergers ever with AOL Time Warner, whose shareholders lost $2oo billion in the aftermath of that dot-com bubble marriage in the early aughts. That didn’t stop the Ellisons’ billions, which have actually made what would have otherwise been a ho-hum year for M&A in media and entertainment pretty interesting. Through their own new acquisition, Paramount, they set off a steeplechase for Warner Bros. Discovery — either as a whole entertainment conglomerate, or as two separated units in Warner Bros. and Discovery Global. That now begs the question of whether the Ellisons would take yet another crack at buying WBD, or maybe just the Warner Bros. studio and HBO, on a hot streak right now. Or do we see some new deep-pocketed buyers emerge? Paramount reportedly made a $20 a share bid for WBD that was spurned, and then two additional bids under $30 a share according to CNBC, leading to CEO David Zaslav‘s announcement: “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.” But the constituency we aren’t reading too much about here is the WBD shareholders who are sitting on a stock at Tuesday’s close that is still 17% lower than when WBD first started trading on April 11, 2022, after Zaslav engineered his Discovery’s takeover of Warner. That is 17% lower, notably, even with the takeover talk bump to WBD stock from when Paramount’s interest first broke and then the 11% rise on Tuesday. For shareholders, that’s three-plus years of watching your stock go in the opposite direction of where it’s supposed to go. Big shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock on the institutional side, and Condé Nast owners the Newhouse family and cable mogul John Malone on the individual side. (Malone inherited the Warner stock, a big bonus over the downward course where Discovery was headed.) The Ellisons seem suited to shake things up. It feels like their parachuting into Hollywood was all about that, with the bags of cash to make it happen. But now that the “For Sale” sign is officially up at WBD, you’d have to consider Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Comcast or maybe even a consortium of private equity or Saudi backers as potentially interested suitors. On Tuesday, Ted Sarandos left the door open to considering Warner, saying on the earnings call: “We focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A,” Sarandos said, with an emphasis on selective M&A for effect. Zaslav brought in the big-gun investment bankers to assist with his review, Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore. Let’s pause for a minute to consider the math: $12.54 — This was WBD’s closing price on Sept. 10, the day before Bloomberg broke the news that Paramount was preparing a bid. $16.17 — This was WBD’s closing price the next day, showing a 29% bump on a so-called takeover premium. Takeover offers in the media space have been attracting a 20% to 25% premium. If Paramount did indeed offer $20 per share offer, that represents a 59% premium from the $12.54 where WBD was languishing before the takeover news broke. But clearly Zaslav and team are thinking that WBD could see more upside from bringing in other potential buyers to boost a premium for the company. Circling back to those downtrodden WBD shareholders. Bank of America Securities on Tuesday placed a value of $30 per share on WBD ($26 for the Warner Bros. studio, which includes HBO, and $4 for the cable networks side, which includes CNN). So what if a buyer would come in with a $30 a share offer for the whole company? That would be a 48% premium to the current price, and 140% premium to the Sept. 10 closing price. Pretty enticing for a shareholder who’s held on for three years in a downward slide. Zaslav was schooled under the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch when he was starting out at NBC, so don’t underestimate his deal savvy, even though WBD shareholders are feeling like they got stuck with a dud.

Tech Companies Pushing Off Those Exits: Research firm CB Insights reported some interesting data last week as part of its State of Venture Q3’25 Report that shows that tech companies are in less of a rush to strike an exit. “The ability to raise at decacorn ($10 billion and above) valuations while staying private removes the pressure to go public for capital. Companies can now scale to a massive size, hire top talent through liquid secondary markets, and maintain founder control — all without the quarterly earnings pressure or regulatory burdens associated with going public,” CB Insights explains. Average time for tech startups to stay private rose from 12.2 years in 2015 to 15.9 years in 2025. See below. 2. AI Killing Jobs? Not if You Look at This Data: It seems like companies are increasingly bringing people on board who help embed AI into daily operations, but new data dispells the widespread notion that the technology is a job killer. The Economist cites work by Seyed Hosseini and Guy Lichtinger, both doctoral students at Harvard University who have been tracking companies that hired “generative-AI integrators.” The students used AI itself to go through 200 million job postings and found 130,000 such vacancies at 10,600 firms that they called “AI adopters.” See below for the upward trend. When you hear Libby Bush talk about her motivating drive over the years, one that has been rewarded with a senior executive role for partnerships at CAA, it’s hard not to think it came from her days on the soccer pitches and lacrosse fields of her youth outside Philadelphia. She ended up playing Division I lacrosse for the University of Richmond Spiders, a sport she’s still involved with near her home in Pacific Palisades. “I certainly didn’t get promoted because I waited for somebody to recognize my worth. It takes fighting for yourself, asking for things even though you might not feel qualified or you might not feel like you’ve hit the mark completely to deserve it. The worst people can say is no. “It’s a little bit of the fake it til you make it. I never worked for an agency. How did I have the right to start one? But I believed enough in myself, I was willing to take the risk and I was willing to hear the word no as many times as I needed to until I heard the word yes. Holding myself back and not doing it because I didn’t have the qualifications was just never a part of the trajectory for me.” Sure feels like the spark of a competitive athlete is still in there somewhere. Bush, 43, spoke to our TV business reporter Lucas Manfredi for last week’s installment of our Office With a View executive Q&A series about the importance of brands becoming an essential tool for creators to both finance and market their projects across platforms. Bush has been responsible for leading the CAA team behind collaborations between hit series like Netflix’s “Bridgerton” and Flonase and Apple TV+’s “Severance” and State Farm. She’s also worked closely on connecting brands directly with CAA clients through projects like Ariana Grande’s Swarovski ad campaign, the NBC competition series “On Brand With Jimmy Fallon” and Kerry Washington’s YouTube series “Street You Grew Up On.” Bush, whose career has taken her to the NBA, WNBA, Disney and to her own startup agency Tandem Entertainment that CAA later purchased, is aware how important it was to hone her own story if she was going to help creators and brands do the same. “One size does not fit all in this business. There’s a lot of options on how to financially get deals done and creatively tell great stories in entertainment and culture.” Ad Age this year put her on its list of Leading Women, an honor for which some commenters on LinkedIn called her a “badass.” Our favorite part of her interview with Lucas was this career advice: “I would also say I learned a lot about mentorship and mentoring. When you work in really big corporations and you start out young in your career in these big organizations, you realize really quickly that people will continue to grow in their careers and they may end up anywhere. “So to me, it was always about treating everybody — whether they were next to you, below you or above you — the same, and how important it is to collect relationships and nurture them. Your network becomes everything to you in your career. Understanding how to use it and protect it and nurture it is a really big lesson for me throughout those companies.” The PR Guy Who Says The AI Boom Is a Bust, Channels with Peter Kafka podcast What’s Your AI-dentity?

Today’s top news: DraftKings just made its most aggressive move yet outside of sports betting. And it wasn’t into casino, poker, or fantasy. It was into prediction markets. 📌 What Happened DraftKings announced it is acquiring Railbird Technologies, a CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange, and will use it to launch a standalone events trading app called DraftKings Predictions. Railbird comes with what Kalshi and others fought hard for - federal approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to let people trade real-money contracts on real-world outcomes. Now DraftKing’s 6M monthly users will get access to prediction markets (and its $15B company has a shiny new expansion path). DraftKings says the new app will launch “in the coming months” and initially cover non-sports markets - things like finance, pop culture, elections, entertainment, and news. Though sports are very likely to come later (especially in states where DraftKings is currently banned). 🗣️ What Are They Saying “We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business. We believe that Railbird’s team and platform—combined with DraftKings’ scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.” - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC “DraftKings acquires prediction market firm Railbird As I shared last week prediction markets are the future for sports wagering Less than a week later you see $DKNG getting involved.” - Rippe, on X “$DKNG is acquiring CFTC-licensed predictions platform Railbird to launch “DraftKings Predictions” a marketplace for trading outcomes in finance, culture & entertainment. It’s a move to tap non-sports states like California & Texas in the coming months.” - Shay Boloor on X 🧠 Why It Matters If prediction markets needed any more validation, they got it here from DraftKings. They have simply become too big to ignore and are now fully crossing over into mainstream betting. There’s also a new battle brewing between two worlds: DraftKings brings three big advantages: They will be a force to be reckoned with in this space. A lot depends on timing here. Someone who is used to betting elections on Polymarket probably won’t switch to DraftKings. But - if DraftKings beats Polymarket to the US market with its new DraftKings Predictions app, it could absolutely steal that average user who knows what prediction markets are / Polymarket is, but doesn’t want to hassle with VPNs. And if DK sports prediction markets have the same liquidity that Kalshi has shown over the past few months, then they could steal significant market share in sports. The bull case is, the entrance of DraftKings into the prediction market sector grows the overall pie and drives weekly volumes even further up and to the right. The bear case - the sector is zero-sum for the near future and any DK share is taken from an existing leader. My gut is, the bull case will prevail for the near future.

Title: Dublin to host Michelin star ceremony – could Ireland be about to get a three-star restaurant?

The Michelin Guide annual ceremony for Britain and Ireland will land in Dublin for the first time in February next year. The selection of an Irish city for the ceremony on February 9th, following Glasgow in 2025, is not just about geography – it’s about signalling that Ireland’s culinary moment is now. At the event in Dublin’s Convention Centre, the Guide will unveil stars, Bibs Gourmands, Green Stars and special awards for “the most talented restaurant teams and chefs from Great Britain and Ireland”. The ceremony will also be livestreamed globally. La Rousse Foods, Musgrave’s premium food service brand, will be official partner. If past years are anything to go by, the Bibs and Green Stars will be teased or quietly announced before the main stars are revealed. In Ireland the speculation about awards is electric. Chapter One in Dublin under Mickael Viljanen and Ross Lewis is viewed as possibly being in line for a third Michelin star. It currently holds two. Liath in Blackrock, Co Dublin, with chef Damien Grey is widely tipped as one to watch – again, rumours suggest a push toward three stars. Dede in Baltimore, Co Cork, helmed by Ahmet Dede and managed by Maria Archer, is also in the conversation for top-tier elevation. For two-star upgrades, names to watch include Lady Anne at Mount Juliet Estate (chef John Kelly) and Adare Manor (chef Mike Tweedie), which is also gearing up to host the Ryder Cup in 2027. Dublin’s incomprehensibly overlooked spots are Library Street Café and Una Mas, both long considered deserving of a first star. The newer challengers – Lena and Comet – may well be poised to make their first splash. Outside Dublin, the Park Hotel Kenmare in Co Kerry under Bryan and Tara Meehan already holds two Michelin Keys for its hotel offering and is undergoing a significant expansion. The owners may well be holding off on chasing a Michelin star for their Landline restaurant, adorned with Seán Scully paintings, until after this upgrade is complete. In a more general sense, hosting the Michelin ceremony in Ireland is symbolic, speaking of recognition and rising ambitions. But hosting isn’t the same as winning. The kitchens still need to deliver. Between now and next February, a few questions are sure to keep buzzing around the Irish restaurant scene. Will Chapter One finally get its third star? Given its pedigree this is internationally accepted as overdue. Will Liath and Dede join the three-star club? It would be a big ask, but the talk is loud. And will there be any surprise entries? We should remember that newcomers often sneak in; we’ll be watching Lena and Comet closely.

Title: How Beyond Meat became the market's latest meme-stock darling

You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You can wear them with a suit or with jeans. They'll earn you street cred with finance bros. The catch? They're $1,100. Zegna's Triple Stitch shoes have unofficially become Wall Street's hottest footwear, exploding in popularity in recent years amid the quiet luxury movement. Apple CEO Tim Cook sports them. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI he wears them too, and that he sees them everywhere. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed a few years back that they're the most-worn shoes on private jets. But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild. Given that it was rainy, I was doubtful I'd find anyone. But within minutes, as I approached Park Avenue, there was a pair walking right at me. A visitor from Charleston, South Carolina, said he had his custom-made last year and picked up three pairs. "I love them," he said, before asking: "Are you gonna buy a pair?" I'll have to save up first, I told him. Do you own a pair of Zegnas or another quiet luxury item you love?

Title: Why Some Bitcoin Whales Are Converting Their BTC Into Spot ETF Shares: Bloomberg
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/22/why-some-bitcoin-whales-are-converting-their-btc-into-spot-etf-shares-bloomberg

Full Content:
Some large bitcoin holders are moving coins into spot exchange-traded funds through in-kind creations, converting off-platform BTC into brokerage-account assets they can borrow against or include in estate plans, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The mechanics rest on a summer policy shift. On July 29, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the decision to approve orders allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto-asset exchange-traded product (ETP) shares, a policy which covers spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The agency called the change a break from earlier cash-only approvals for spot bitcoin and ether and an alignment with long-standing practice for commodity ETPs. In practice, the SEC said authorized participants can deliver or receive the underlying asset, rather than cash, when creating or redeeming ETP shares. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the shift would make products “less costly and more efficient,” while Trading and Markets Director Jamie Selway called it an “important development” that adds flexibility for issuers and investors. Against that backdrop, Bloomberg reported that some whales are handing BTC to ETFs and receiving fund shares without selling, a structure the outlet noted is generally tax-neutral because no sale is recorded. The exposure stays the same, but it appears in a brokerage account where it can be pledged as collateral or folded into estate planning, Bloomberg said. Activity is already visible, Bloomberg reported. BlackRock has facilitated more than $3 billion of such conversions, its head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick said. Bitwise told Bloomberg it is getting daily inquiries from clients who want holdings reflected on wealth platforms. Galaxy has processed a handful of transactions, Bloomberg added, citing Michael Harvey. Some clients shift only a slice of holdings; a “subset” consolidates entirely because “it’s the easiest way” to hold going forward, Mitchnick told Bloomberg. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said there are “benefits of having things in the traditional financial system,” including how clients are serviced by private banks. Banks already play a limited role in facilitating these trades — particularly on creations — even as only non-bank broker-dealers can currently complete the full process, Bloomberg added. Neither BlackRock, Bitwise nor Galaxy immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Title: DWS Transforms $2.5M ESG ETF into Something Much Different
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/dws-transforms-2-5m-esg-etf-into-something-much-different/

Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com It’s not that unusual to change one’s appearance: Just ask all the bros who can’t wait to stop shaving in Movember. But if a fund got a different name, ticker, benchmark and investment process, is it still the same fund, or just a way of seeding a new product? One DWS Xtrackers ETF is having something of an identity crisis, going from a value ESG mandate to being an S&P 100 fund that simply cuts out the biggest names in the index. And that’s after a name change the fund already had earlier this year. On Dec. 19, the Xtrackers S&P 500 Value Scored & Screened ETF (SNPV), which until February had been the S&P 500 Value ESG ETF, will become the S&P 100 Ex Top 20 ETF (XOEX). Whew. It’s common for asset managers to change funds’ names and investment strategies. That has all but been the norm amid a pullback in the US from sustainable and ESG mandates, with many products removing any hint of those labels. The trend was in the opposite direction a few years ago, when seemingly every fund shop wanted in on ESG, and many existing products saw slight modifications to reflect that. This year, however, the Janus Henderson Responsible International Dividend Fund dropped “Responsible” from its name, and the BlackRock Sustainable Balanced Fund scrapped “Sustainable.” Both of those funds backed off from ESG-related goals, according to a Morningstar analysis. Other products, such as the Sprott Critical Materials ETF and Cromwell Foresight Global Infrastructure Fund, had name changes but retained their investment strategies. Assets have been pouring out of US sustainable and ESG-themed products in recent years, and small funds have been closing : The move by DWS to morph its ETF into essentially a different product stands out from the more measured changes many issuers have made in repurposing funds. Nonetheless, SNPV’s metamorphosis won’t affect too many investors, as it represents just $2.5 million in assets. DWS, through a PR firm, declined to comment. However, the fund’s new strategy aligns it somewhat with others this year that have addressed the extreme concentration in market-cap-weighted indexes of just a few companies, like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. What Are Sustainable Investors to Do? Clearly, there are fewer ESG-related funds on the market today than just a few years ago. But investors still have choices, as asset managers dedicated to the space aren’t leaving. “There are big players out there like Parnassus, Calvert, etc., who are starting to offer ETFs. This is a huge shift and helps open the space to investors who want a more tax-friendly approach and lower investment minimums,” said Justin Horowitz, owner of Just Advising, which offers an ethical investing option. “Other mainstream names, like BlackRock, still offer their ESG funds, but it does seem harder to find them through their website nowadays.” Either one of these popular tax-advantaged strategies can help clients diversify and defer tax bills, but they can be complex as well as costly. Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record $477M in inflows after four days of outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-477m-in-inflows-after-four-days-of-outflows/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T08:16:05Z

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered strong inflows on Tuesday, reversing the previous week’s outflow trend. According to data from Farside Investors, total daily net inflows reached $477.2 million, signalling renewed investor confidence following a period of volatility in the crypto market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflows with $210.9 million, while the Ark & 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $162.8 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also recorded $34.15 million in new investments. The inflows come after several consecutive sessions of net withdrawals across spot crypto ETFs, which collectively lost over $1 billion in recent days as persistent trade tensions between the US and China weighed on investor sentiment. Despite the rebound in inflows, overall trading activity remained elevated. Bitcoin ETFs posted $7.41 billion in total trade volume on Tuesday. Throughout October, daily trading volumes have fluctuated between $5 billion and $9.78 billion — significantly higher than the $2 billion to $4 billion range seen in September. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw renewed investor participation. On Tuesday, the funds collectively attracted $141.6 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the largest portion at $59 million, while additional inflows came from funds operated by BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck. The combined rebound across Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional appetite for crypto exposure remains strong despite recent price corrections. At the time of writing on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $108,500, stabilising after facing resistance the previous day. The cryptocurrency found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453, drawn from its April low of $74,508 to its record high of $126,199. BTC rebounded nearly 4% by Monday but later slipped 2% on Tuesday after being rejected from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,606. If the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could revisit support near $106,453. A decisive close below this level may open the door for further declines toward the October 10 low of $102,000. Ethereum (ETH) has also shown signs of weakness, extending its recent correction. After retreating by more than 4% last week from resistance at $4,232, the cryptocurrency continued to slide by another 3% through Tuesday. ETH was trading around $3,847 on Wednesday. Should the downward trend persist, Ethereum may test the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,593, which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA — a key area that could determine whether the broader trend remains intact or shifts further bearish.

Title: Reimagined 1970s three-bed apartment in the heart of Ballsbridge for €800,000

One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?
