The former chief executive of the Mater Private Network of hospitals and clinics Fergus Clancy left an estate valued at €15.8 million, according to documents published by the Probate Office this week. Mr Clancy, of Lagore Road, Dunshaughlin, Co Meath, died aged in his late 50s at the Mater hospital in April 2024. The married father of two began his professional life in the post room of insurance company Church & General before gaining experience handling medical malpractice cases. He went on to establish his own consultancy, Circa Healthcare Consulting. He also proposed a centralised State insurance scheme for doctors that was then adopted by former minister for health Brian Cowen. Following the sale of his consultancy to Aon, Mr Clancy became chief executive of the Mater Private Network in 2005, later taking the role of executive chairman. The Fergus Clancy Bursary for Healthcare Leadership and Entrepreneurship is awarded by the Future Health Summit to fully fund a person’s masters in healthcare leadership. The summit says the bursary is in honour of “our friend and colleague Fergus Clancy who showed such ambition, passion, determination and leadership in Irish healthcare over his long and distinguished career”. Meanwhile, Mervyn Howard Heatley, of Ballyman Road, Bray, Co Wicklow, a farmer who was noted for his collection of steam traction engines and vintage tractors, left an estate valued at €12.17 million, when he died in October last year. Mr Heatley, known as Howard, was a supporter of the Enniskerry Festival’s Victorian Field Day, which was held on his farm on a number of occasions. His son, also called Mervyn, runs a vintage car dealership called Classic Prestige Cars, which is based at Ballyman Road, Bray. The will of Mary Keegan, Dogstown, Trim, Co Meath, outlined an estate valued at €5.2 million when she died in February 2024. Ms Keegan was the widow of quarrying company executive Dessie Keegan. Jonathan Griffin, who also went by John, with an address at Bray Road, Foxrock, died in October 2023, leaving a €3.6 million estate. He was remembered for his attendance at the United Arts Club and time spent living in Chicago. After his death in November 2024, Cornelius Michael O’Riordan, of Meanus, Kilmallock, Co Limerick, left an estate of just more than €3 million. Monica Sheridan Dauer, of Mount Dutton House, Oldcastle, Co Meath, left an estate valued at €2.9 million when she died in August 2024. Eilis (Alice) Tansey, of Avoca Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, who died on March 8th, 2024, left €2.9 million. Edward (Ned) Grace of Seapoint Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin, a retired Smurfit executive, left an estate worth €2.4 million when he died in December 2024. Lucy Mary Teresa Gannon and Kathleen Gannon, of a shared address on Serpentine Park, Ballsbridge, Dublin, each left €1.4 million upon their deaths in December 2020 and November 2022 respectively. Seán Gallagher, of Stillorgan Grove, Blackrock previously of CTT and Enterprise Ireland, left an estate of €1.2 million upon his death in January 2023. The estate figures represent the total value of all assets at the time of a person’s death. They typically include the value of a family home or farm and investments.

Title: Obituary: Edward O’Grady, trainer who conquered Cheltenham and was embroiled in betting coup

Tipperary man was arrested but not charged in 1975 over attempt to win big at the bookies with a bait-and-switch Edward O'Grady never spoke about the betting scandal Trainer Edward O'Grady. Photo: Sportsfile Pierce Brosnan in 1980s TV movie 'Murphy's Stroke', based on trainer Edward O'Grady Edward O’Grady, of Thurles, Co Tipperary, who has died aged 75, was the leading Irish trainer at Cheltenham in the 1980s and 1990s, but he first came to prominence in 1975 with his arrest at that festival in connection with the Gay Future betting coup, known to insiders as “Operation Crock of Gold”. The idea was a bait-and-switch, ­taking advantage of the backwardness of the Cartmel racecourse in Cumbria, which in 1974 had only just installed a permanent telephone but was not connected to the bookmakers’ ­Exchange Telegraph Blower system. The “Cork Mafia”, led by the building tycoon Tony Murphy, bought a promising chestnut called Gay Future. Officially Gay Future would be trained by a Scot (who was in on the scam) called Tony Collins, who had not had a winner in 18 months. In fact, the nag that plodded around Collins’s gallops was a chestnut lookalike, while the real Gay Future was sent in secret to be trained by O’Grady in Co Tipperary. Gay Future was sailed to ­Britain and handed over on a country road off the M6 48 hours before the ­Ulverston Novices’ Hurdle on the August Bank Holiday 1974. Trainer Edward O'Grady. Photo: Sportsfile At the last minute, the undistinguished jockey was swapped for the talented Timmy Jones, who simulated incompetence by falling off twice in the ring. One of O’Grady’s men, disguised in a wig and sunglasses, rubbed soap suds into Gay Future to make it look as if he were in a muck of sweat. The Cork Mafia, meanwhile, flew to London where they placed more than 500 double and treble bets on three Collins-trained runners across various courses: Gay Future at Cartmel, Opera Cloak at Plumpton and Ankerwyke at Southwell. The bookies accepted these so-called “hail Mary” bets greedily — unaware that both Opera Cloak and Ankerwyke would be pulled from their races, leaving them obliged to honour bets on Gay Future alone. At first, all went well. Gay Future romped home at 10-1. Cartmel’s single telephone was mysteriously cut off, so the starting price was unaffected by the turmoil of betting in London. The bookies who had taken the trebles were not unduly worried, as two more legs of the bet were still left to run. Panic only began to spike when Opera Cloak and Ankerwyke were both declared non-runners. The mistake that caused the coup to unravel was that the same reason was given for both horses’ withdrawals: a broken-down horsebox. A Daily Mail reporter rang up Collins’s yard in Scotland, to be told by his housekeeper that the horses were grazing in the paddock — they had never been sent at all. Sensing fraud, many bookmakers refused to pay up, and after a legal battle the Cork Mafia wound up collecting a fraction of their winnings. Collins and Murphy were convicted at Preston crown court for conspiracy to defraud. O’Grady was arrested but the charges were dropped; he took a helicopter back to the Cheltenham Festival, where he still had runners. Played by Pierce Brosnan in a thinly disguised version for the television film Murphy’s Stroke (1980), O’Grady never spoke about the Gay Future affair, observing: “Do you know what the mouse said to the trap? ‘We won’t go into that.’” Pierce Brosnan in 1980s TV movie 'Murphy's Stroke', based on trainer Edward O'Grady Edward Joseph O’Grady was born on September 27, 1949, son of three-times Irish champion jump jockey turned trainer Willie O’Grady, and his wife Mary (nee Hogan), sister of the trainer PP Hogan. From Blackrock College in Dublin he studied veterinary science until his father’s untimely death in 1972, when he took over the yard. He attracted the patronage of JP McManus, and became Ireland’s champion National Hunt trainer from 1977 to 1980. At Cheltenham he saddled 18 winners, starting with Mr Midland ridden by Mouse Morris in 1974 and ending with Sky’s The Limit in the 2006 Coral Cup — a strong showing for an Irishman in the pre-Willie-Mullins era and at the time behind only ­Vincent O’Brien and Arkle’s trainer Tom Dreaper. His finest horse was agreed to be Golden Cygnet, short-lived winner of the 1978 Supreme Novices’ Hurdle — “the James Dean of racing”, O’Grady said. He is survived by his third wife, Kay, by a son and two daughters from his first marriage and two daughters from his second marriage.

Title: 400 TPS and “Ethereum on your phone”: Vitalik Buterin & Tomasz K. Stańczak dropped big news at ETHKyiv 2025

ETHKyiv 2025 unveiled Ethereum's leap to 400 TPS, redefining network efficiency and accessibility. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post and opinion of Rostyslav Bortman, Founder of Ethereum Ukraine. Even in wartime Kyiv, innovation doesn’t pause. At ETHKyiv 2025, more than 100 hackers proved it—shipping privacy-first dApps, competing for grants, and showing what’s possible when the world’s toughest challenges meet Web3 grit. But the real shockwaves came from the founders themselves: Vitalik Buterin and Tomasz K. Stańczak, Executive Director at the Ethereum Foundation, who both appeared as the event’s online speakers, dropped two bombshells—400 TPS on Ethereum L1 this year, and a near future where anyone can run a full node on their smartphone. So what’s next for the protocol? When does 400 TPS arrive, and what does “Ethereum on your phone” actually mean for developers and users? Here’s what we learned at ETHKyiv 2025. Vitalik Buterin’s keynote at ETHKyiv 2025 cut straight to Ethereum’s core roadmap. The biggest reveal: “Pretty soon you’ll be able to spin up a node on your smartphones and even smartwatches.” According to Buterin, instead of relying on servers with terabytes of storage, soon users will be able to run a full Ethereum node “without heavy-duty resources.” This first-of-its-kind case will be possible thanks to zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) that the Ethereum Foundation is currently implementing. zkEVMs are making nodes drastically lighter, cutting storage through verifying transactions without revealing and importing any information about them. On Ethereum’s L2s, zkEVMs already cut transaction costs by up to 90% and settle in their finality under three seconds. Buterin said the next step is bringing these improvements to the Ethereum mainnet, making blockchain interactions on it as fast and affordable as traditional web applications. At ETHKyiv 2025, Tomasz K. Stańczak, Co-Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, spelled out exactly what’s next for Ethereum’s backbone: real performance gains on the mainnet itself. He revealed that by the end of 2026, Ethereum will move to 3-Slot Finality (3SF), slashing average transaction confirmation time from 15 minutes down to only 36 seconds. For users, this will bring the experience of instant traditional digital payments while keeping all the benefits of decentralization. Stańczak laid out the near-term milestones: Ethereum L1 will hit 400 transactions per second (TPS) by the end of 2025. Block gas limits will reach 100 million this year, with a jump to 60 million per block in a month or two (as of publication date—ed.). For context: scaling Ethereum L1 is essential because it anchors the entire ecosystem, providing the security, settlement, and censorship resistance Layer 2s depend on. With faster mainnet throughput, users get greater assurance their transactions are finalized on a decentralized, global network—not bottlenecked by L2 operators. As Vitalik Buterin summed up: “The goal is to make Ethereum more private, more censorship-resistant, and at the same time, so easy that even people far from tech feel safe using it every day.” For me and all the Ethereum followers, some big questions have always remained: what actually underpins Ethereum’s value, and what could trigger mass adoption? When I pressed both Vitalik Buterin and Tomasz Stańczak for answers at ETHKyiv 2025, they each zeroed in on different but connected drivers. Tomasz pointed to three non-negotiables: privacy, data protection, and transparency. According to him, these are precisely what enterprise clients and regular users now expect from any blockchain platform. “Ethereum is a global network, and increased adoption directly boosts the value of the whole ecosystem,” he explained. The more Ethereum is used for real-world utility—by businesses and by individuals—the more demand, and ultimately, value accrues. Vitalik, meanwhile, framed the adoption question around financial utility. His thesis: mass adoption comes when Ethereum becomes the rails for real-world assets, particularly tokenized stocks and bonds. “They’re the gateway to mass adoption and the bridge between traditional finance and Web3,” he said. With heavyweights like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, and Coinbase actively leveraging Ethereum for asset tokenization, we’re already seeing the lines blur between traditional finance’s $117 trillion market and Web3 infrastructure. In short: Ethereum’s real value isn’t just speculative, but it’s being built right now at the intersection of security, privacy, and practical financial applications. That’s where mass adoption starts to look inevitable. ETHKyiv 2025 indeed stood out for its access to global thought leaders. Despite all the war-related risks, developers here heard first-hand insights from Ethereum’s most influential builders. As Stańczak himself described it: “Enterprise, DeFi, explorations, AI, research, day-to-day problems, working with people—we have to understand the direction and give feedback. A lot of it.” His daily routine—hours spent answering questions from developers—underscores how Ethereum’s power lies in its people, not just its protocol. Crucially, ETHKyiv 2025 was never just another tech event on the calendar. Held against the backdrop of an ongoing war, it became living proof of something bigger: even in the darkest times, Ukraine’s tech community chooses to build, learn, and connect with the global ecosystem. Throughout the hackathon, the wartime context was impossible to ignore, yet it wasn’t a shadow but a driving force. Performances by Moisei Bondarenko, the violinist-soldier whose music echoes through liberated Ukrainian cities, reminded everyone that innovation and humanity must go hand in hand. So did the tactical medicine session led by combat medic Artem Rudy, bringing practical skills and a sense of shared resilience to the room. This is what set ETHKyiv 2025 apart: it was a gathering of minds and hearts, a testament to the persistence of community, curiosity, and shared values—even in wartime. The world watched not just for the tech, but for the spirit of resilience and solidarity that Ukraine’s builders brought to the stage.

REUTERS/Stephane Mahe By Kat Hidalgo and Silas Brown Aug 1, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Terminal Investment Ltd., the port operator controlled by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte, raised $2.5 billion through a privately-placed bond sale. The debt sale by the company, known as TiL, was split between seven, 10-, 12- and 20-year maturities, and ranks among the bigger private placements so far this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The package was denominated in both dollars and euros, they said. Citigroup Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. arranged the deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Citigroup declined to comment, Mizuho Financial Group, TiL and spokespeople for Gianluigi Aponte didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The so-called US private placement market is a way for blue-chip businesses to bypass volatile public markets and secure funds directly from institutional investors such as insurers.

Title: US Crypto ETFs Record Best Month Yet With $13 Billion July Influx

There is no question that 2025 has been a good year—so far—for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), garnering significant amounts of capital every week. While the investment products struggled at the start of the year, as did most of the global financial markets, the United States ETF market had a remarkable performance in the past quarter. Interestingly, July marked the start of another productive quarter for the crypto ETFs in the United States, with the investment products posting capital inflows in the month. According to the latest market data, July 2025 might be the best month yet for the digital asset-linked funds after registering tens of billions of dollars in capital influx in the 30-day period. On Friday, August 1, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas took to the social media platform X to reveal that the US crypto ETF market just had its best monthly performance yet in July 2025. According to the latest market data, the investment products took in more than $12.8 billion in capital—at a pace of $600 million per day—in the past month. To put into perspective, the pace of daily additions in July is about twice the average of the crypto exchange-traded funds. According to Balchunas, the digital asset-linked investment products outperformed every single ETF, including “the mighty VOO”—referring to Vanguard’s S&P 500 fund—over the past month. Balchunas added: Further, every ETF in category took in cash (ex the converted Trusts) w/ Bitcoin and Ether making equal contributions. Most all-around dominant performance since the Eagles ended the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Will be hard to top. The US crypto ETF market is led by the Bitcoin spot ETFs, with a total asset of over $146.48 billion currently under management. The Bitcoin ETF is completely dominated by BlackRock’s IBIT, which has its total assets under management (AUM) at over $84 billion, and is followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at almost $23 billion. Meanwhile, the Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds, which launched more than 6 months after their BTC counterparts, have a total AUM of $20.1 billion. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock also leads this market, with its ETH ETF (ETHA) having a total of $10.71 billion in assets under management. According to data from CoinGecko, the total crypto market capitalization stands at around $3.78 billion, having declined by 5% in the past 24 hours. On Friday, the crypto market succumbed to massive bearish pressure, with the top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana suffering major losses. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Corporate America is not falling for the left’s outrage over Sydney Sweeney’s ‘good jeans’ ad

The left is trying its best to stir up a furor over the recent Sydney Sweeney jeans (or is it genes) TV commercial to ignite a backlash similar to the Dylan Mulvaney-Bud Light debacle. Sorry progressives, it ain’t happening. Yes, there’s lots of chirping from lefty columnists, purple-haired TikTok influencers, late-night hosts who are still employed, and assorted wokesters after American Eagle had the audacity to feature the attractive blond, blue-eyed actress expressing her sartorial flair in a pair of tight-fitting blue jeans. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color . . . my jeans are blue,” the “Euphoria” star says. The ad ends with a voice-over: “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” Blond women? Blue-eyed? Good genes (I mean jeans)? Oh, the horror! That’s if you are listening to the leftist commentariat that still hasn’t piped down weeks after the spot first appeared. The lefties are freaking because they think the jeans company is looking to bring back the bad old days, pre-George Floyd of course, when white blond oppressors ruled over American culture. It’s all very Hitler-like to the progressive numbskull class, but not to just about every other segment of American society. Most Americans of all colors and genders either don’t care, or they know good genes and jeans when they see it. I know this based on lots of reporting on the mind virus known wokeness — the progressive orthodoxy that embraces everything from cultural Marxism, DEI and, of course, the oppressor-oppressed theology. We are a diverse country, and that’s good. The wokesters take it to a level that excludes rather than includes. Good-looking white people, particularly if their hair is that evil shade known as blond, are nowhere near the intersectional matrix they demand for hiring or image making in their version of America. That’s why Sydney Sweeney, known more for her cleavage than her politics, has become a touchstone in our culture wars, and here’s why the attacks won’t work: Wokeness was once big in the business world, but notice my use of the past tense. Corporate America listened to these kooks for many reasons, including their own progressive management leanings, with disastrous results. They learned the hard way that most Americans of all races hate being proselytized with political dogma, particularly of the left-wing variety that pushes the limits of identity and gender politics beyond cultural norms. I chronicled this spectacle with a healthy dose of schadenfreude in my book “Go Woke Go Broke: The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America.” Just a few short years ago, DEI was the norm; so was radical environmentalism pushed by asset managers through something called ESG investing. It was difficult finding a straight man or woman — God forbid a blond — who survived the Madison Avenue woke censor machine. Budweiser thought its customers were ready for a commercial featuring a half-naked trans woman in a bubble bath. Disney decided it could sell more kids programming featuring same-sex kissing scenes. Money managers like BlackRock thought they could increase returns by advocating environmentalism and de facto racial quotas on their portfolio companies. All of the above resulted in some of the biggest brand-destroying disasters in modern business history. Marketing is a lot like politics. It’s a business of addition, not subtraction. You build customers just like you attract voters, through messaging that unites rather than divides — or customers flee. There are exceptions, of course. Niche brands like Ben & Jerry’s ice cream attempt and succeed at targeting the tree-hugger demo. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Try this stuff on a mass audience and you will get the beatdown of the century. The predictable customer revolt impacted the businesses of Budweiser, Disney and BlackRock in such a measurable way that shareholders revolted, too, forcing some of the most progressive CEOs in the world to course-correct. That’s why the Sydney Sweeney uproar will go nowhere with the people who matter most: Most American consumers, and American Eagle shareholders. Unless you’re stretching it like Silly Putty, there’s nothing inherently political about a pretty blond (dare I say “All American”-looking) woman in jeans and pointing out the health of her genes to sell stuff. Zero. Zilch. Otherwise, Pamela Anderson would have been a poster child for Aryan Nations instead of the “Baywatch” babe most American men and many women adored, and still do. Shares of American Eagle are up since the Sydney Sweeney ad ran, despite the backlash. NYU Marketing Professor Eitan Muller points out the obvious, telling Fox Business’s Teuta Dedvukaj that the commercial “attracts attention, drives Google searches, and boosts the brand. Yes, she does have great genes — and it rings authentic. That’s what you want from an ad.” My bet: You will be seeing a lot more of Sydney Sweeney. Most men will be rejoicing, many women will buy the company’s jeans. Management will be rewarded with higher sales and a stock price that matches. The attacks will ultimately fail for the same reason Mulvaney’s tenure as a spokeswoman for Bud Light was so short-lived. Recall: The nation’s Number 1-selling beer dropped to Number 3 and never recovered. Sydney Sweeney has both good jeans and genes and there’s nothing the wokesters can do to change that reality.

Title: No Gold? No Problem: Why XRP Stands Strong On Its Own—Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Reports have disclosed that XRP community commentator Versan Aljarrah says XRP could gain a link to gold without actually holding bullion. According to Aljarrah, XRP would simply move gold-backed stablecoins across the XRP Ledger. The commentator argues that this role would give XRP a “synthetic connection” to tokenized assets like gold and oil, even though XRP itself would not carry any gold reserves. According to Aljarrah, XRP only needs to power the on-chain movement of gold-pegged coins. Based on reports, each gold token on the XRPL would represent one gram of real gold. Custodians such as MKS Pamp and Imperial Vaults would hold the physical bars. XRP would then step in to provide liquidity and settle trades on the ledger’s built-in exchange. Aljarrah sees this setup as a way for the altcoin to stay useful in global finance. $XRP doesn’t need to be backed by gold. It just needs to move it. When gold-pegged stablecoins live on $XRPL, XRP bridges them. And in doing so, it becomes synthetically linked to gold, oil, and every asset they tokenize. pic.twitter.com/q0Ti2pQuDp — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) July 27, 2025 Meld Gold is the only issuer currently close to launching a gold token on the XRPL. Reports have disclosed that Meld plans to back each token with one gram of physical gold. The firm says it will work with major vault operators. So far, no other gold token projects, including PAX Gold (PAXG), have moved onto XRP’s network. Supporters hope that more issuers will follow once Meld proves the concept. Reports note that issuing gold tokens is more than writing code. Each issuer must tie its token to audits, legal contracts and insured vaults. On top of that, XRP’s fixed supply and decentralized consensus system make direct asset backing tricky. Matt Hamilton, a former Ripple developer, has said the crypto asset can’t be backed by gold in a traditional way. Analysts add that its price moves with adoption, legal clarity and market mood, not by hype. Meanwhile, Aljarrah says big names like JPMorgan, BlackRock, the Bank for International Settlements and the IMF have made private plans to use XRP as a bridge. Yet no public evidence supports that claim. Most large asset managers have focused on blockchains with clear rules. Until the Ripple-SEC lawsuit ends, top institutions are likely to hold back. That case could decide if XRP is treated like a security, and that will affect any tokenized assets on the XRPL. According to analysis, a bridge role alone won’t peg XRP’s price to the spot gold rate of $2,950 that some in the community mention. Instead, if gold-pegged tokens take off, the altcoin could see more trading volume and tighter spreads. That might nudge its price upward, but it would still trade on its own merits as a liquidity tool for cross-border payments.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US Crypto Exchange-Traded Funds Beat Out Vanguard’s Legendary S&P 500 ETF in Record-Setting Month of Inflows: Analyst

Time Published: 2025-08-02T16:55:13Z
Full Content:
New data from senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas reveals that US crypto ETFs (exchange-traded funds) beat out Vanguard’s renowned S&P 500 ETF (VOO) in July. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Balchunas notes that US crypto ETFs had a staggering $12.8 billion worth of inflows in July, outpacing all other ETFs, including VOO, which currently has $713.13 billion in assets under its management. “US Crypto ETFs took in $12.8 billion in July, the best month ever, [at] a $600m/day pace, about double [the] average. As a group, that’s more than any single ETF did, including the Mighty VOO. Further, every ETF in [the] category took in cash (ex the converted trusts) w/ Bitcoin and Ether making equal contributions. Most all-around dominant performance since the Eagles ended the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Will be hard to top.” The analyst goes on to say that asset management titan BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is doing well and drawing in new customers. “Amazing stat: 75% of the investors who bought IBIT ($87 billion via one million people) were first-time customers of BlackRock. And 27% of them went on to buy another iShares ETF. Just a total coup for BLK all around.” According to Balchunas, IBIT – which launched in January 2024 – had a significant hand in Bitcoin’s (BTC) massive price growth over the last two years. “1) ETFs hold BTC at a 1:1 ratio. There is no lending, there is no paper IOUs. ETFs are clean and above board and every dime of AUM is connected to the proportional Bitcoin. 2) Zoom out: Bitcoin is up nearly 300%(!) since the infamous BlackRock filing two years ago. ETF flows big part of that. 3) From what I am hearing on here, the selling is annoyed OGs who don’t like that Wall St. and the government has adopted BTC. I guess they prefer BTC to have intermediaries like Sam Bankman-Fraud instead.” Bitcoin is trading for $113,763 at time of writing, a 3.2% decrease on the day while IBIT and VOO are valued at $64.27 and $572, respectively.

Title: Ethereum Eyes a Push Toward $4,800 as BlackRock Pushes for Staking in Spot ETH ETF

Ethereum (ETH) continues to hold strong above the key $3,500 level, fueling bullish momentum that could set the stage for a retest of its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). Calling out this development, HolderStat noted that if ETH holds above the $3,500–$3,600 zone, bulls could reclaim control and target the $4,600–$4,800 resistance, with the macro trend staying bullish unless support breaks decisively. The on-chain metrics provider added, “ETH surged past 4,400 recently and has now entered a corrective phase, dipping toward the 3,576 support zone. The move follows a series of triangle breakouts, and the current retracement is consistent with a bullish continuation pattern.” Ethereum soared to its historic high price of $4,878 in November 2021 and has yet to reclaim that level in more than three years. If HolderStat’s analysis sees the light of day, ETH might surge to this level. At the time of this writing, Ethereum was trading at $3,450, according to CoinMarketCap data. BlackRock is breaking new ground in institutional crypto by seeking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to enable staking in its spot ETH ETF, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), marking a bold step toward yield-generating digital assets. If approved, ETHA would be one of the first listed spot Ethereum ETFs on American soil to offer built-in staking rewards. Unlike current ETFs that only track ETH’s price, ETHA could unlock a 3% annual yield, bridging the gap with native holders and boosting capital efficiency. The SEC has up to 45 days, which is extendable to 90, to respond, with a final deadline potentially in April 2026, though analysts anticipate a decision as early as late 2025. Meanwhile, close to 1 million Ethereum, worth a whopping $3.43 billion, has been permanently lost to user error, underscoring a major vulnerability in crypto asset management and self-custody.

Title: Ireland come from behind to take late win over Scotland in World Cup warm-up

If Ireland showed some pre-World Cup rust, they quickly shook it off to overturn a 14-point deficit in a five-try victory over Scotland in Cork. First international tries from props Sadhbh McGrath and Niamh O’Dowd, plus Exeter Chiefs debutant Nancy McGillivray, were highlight moments from the six-point success. After the double sickener of losing backrowers Erin King and Dorothy Wall for the World Cup, the form of Grace Moore to earn player-of-the-match honours was most welcome. Head coach Scott Bemand was also boosted by the returns of captain Sam Monaghan and Béibhinn Parsons for their first caps in 15 months. With gaps to fill in the pack, Bemand handed debuts to Connacht flankers Ivana Kiripati from the start and Ailish Quinn off the bench. Amid early nerves, Kiripati knocked on from a lineout and Lisa Thomson pounced for the opening touchdown before also converting. Within six minutes Scotland unleashed a set-piece power play as Lucia Scott sliced through untouched to score. Thomson’s conversion made it 14-0. But a serious injury to Lana Skeldon seemed to take the wind out of their sails. Ireland made that momentum swing count as 20-year-old prop McGrath barged over for her first international try. Dannah O’Brien’s conversion hit the post. It was two tries in four minutes when Moore’s break led to a quick-passing move which saw Méabh Deely race home. O’Brien nailed the touchline conversion to trail 14-12 at half-time. It took six second-half minutes before Ireland grabbed their first lead. Kiripati was initially held up over the line, but once Scotland kicked the restart out on the full, Ireland punished them with McGillivray’s memorable debut try. The lead remained at three as O’Brien missed off the tee. Scottish discipline continued to erode. A deliberate knock-on saw winger Coreen Grant sinbinned as they coughed up 11 consecutive penalties either side of half-time. Out of nothing, the visitors got back ahead in their last play with 14 players. Poor defending allowed Emma Orr to sprint through a gap to touch down before Thomson’s kick made it 21-17. But Ireland dug deep to edge ahead after 67 minutes. O’Dowd ripped possession out of Scottish hands before the Wexford native found herself at the end of the move to dive over. Enya Breen’s conversion came up short. They earned a late cushion when Deirbhile Nic a Bháird dashed over from an advancing lineout maul. Breen became the second home kicker to strike the post, but their lead was never threatened. Scoring sequence – 15 mins: Thomson try, con 0-7; 21: Scott try, Thomson con 0-14; 34: McGrath try 5-14; 37: Deely try, O’Brien con 12-14; Half-time 12-14; 45: McGillivray try 17-14; 63: Orr try, Thomson con 17-21; 67: O’Dowd try 22-21; 76: Nic a Bháird try 27-21 IRELAND: M Deely (Blackrock College/Connacht); B Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), N McGillivray (Exeter Chiefs), E Higgins (Railway Union/Leinster), A-L Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); D O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), M Scuffil-McCabe (Manawatū/Leinster); S McCarthy (Railway Union/Munster), C Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), S McGrath (Cooke/Ulster); E Corri-Fallon (Blackrock College/Leinster), S Monaghan (Gloucester Hartpury/IQ Rugby, capt); G Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), I Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), B Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Strategy owning 3–7% of Bitcoin supply is not too much – Michael Saylor

Strategy to double down on preferred stock offerings for more BTC buys. Saylor implied that there was nothing wrong with his firm eyeing 1.5 million BTC, or about 7% of the BTC total supply. The firm saw a profitable Q2, the first time following several red quarters. Michael Saylor, chairman of Strategy (MicroStrategy), has downplayed concerns about the firm’s aggressive Bitcoin [BTC] buys, which now control 3% of the overall BTC supply. In a recent CNBC interview, Saylor stated, “I don’t think owning 3% to 7% of Bitcoin supply is too much. BlackRock has more than that.” Strategy currently holds 628,791 BTC, about 3% of the overall BTC supply. A 7% target would imply owning 1,470,000 BTC or about 1.5 million coins. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries The firm also revealed a profitable Q2 during the latest earnings call held on the 31st of July. It made $10 billion in net income in Q2, marking the first profitable quarter after a series of losses. Additionally, its BTC holding gain hit $13.2 billion on a YTD (year-to-date) basis. The aggressive BTC acquisition has been funded through stock issuance and debt. However, the ongoing sale of stocks to raise capital has led to share dilution amid a drop in mNAV (modified net asset value), an indicator that tracks the market value of a firm relative to its BTC holdings. To prevent further dilution, Strategy said that it will only sell MSTR shares when the mNAV is above 2.5x. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel hailed the move as ‘best in class’ for MSTR treasury management. Source: Excerpt from Strategy’s earnings report At press time, the mNAV was at 1.62x, down from the record level of 3.89x hit last November. Now, the firm will focus on the yield-bearing preferred perpetual stocks to raise the capital for BTC buys. They include Stretch [STRC], Strike [STRK], Stride [STRD], and Strife [STRF]. But Stretch [STRC] appeared to be the most favorable perpetual preferred stock, going by the largest $2.5 billion raise that was finalized recently to buy over 21K BTC. It has a variable yield based on market performance, and Saylor billed it as a ‘treasury BTC,’ more like a money market fund. In contrast, he presented the common stock MSTR as ‘amplified BTC’ for those seeking a 2x BTC exposure. In fact, Saylor viewed MSTR as undervalued at current levels, citing its $24B estimated net income and shared the firm’s post that stated, “Strategy is misunderstood and undervalued $MSTR” Source: Strategy/X In a note to clients, Wall Street analysts at Benchmark echoed the same and placed a buy rating for MSTR with a price target of $705, adding that, “The upshot is that MSTR is not just buying bitcoin anymore, but instead engineering a corporate treasury machine designed to generate Bitcoin-denominated returns, manage its capital raises with precision, and scale faster.” At press time, MSTR was valued at $366.63, down 8.7% during the intra-day trading session on the 1st of August. BTC was down only 2% over the same period. Source: MSTR, TradingView Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Saylor Clarifies Strategy’s Bitcoin Game Plan: “We’re Not Hoarding It All”

Time Published: 2025-08-02T14:00:18Z

Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, is doubling down on Bitcoin. Executive chairman Michael Saylor went on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Friday to explain why the company isn’t just holding the cryptocurrency—it’s building its business around it. Saylor called Bitcoin “digital capital” and revealed that Strategy has now bought over 628,000 BTC, which is worth around $72 billion. That makes up nearly 3% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist. The company recently raised $2.5 billion through an IPO of Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock, selling 28 million shares at $90 each. Those funds were used to buy 21,021 BTC on July 29. According to Saylor, Strategy has done four fundraising rounds this year. Two of them pulled in $500 million each, and another brought in $1 billion. The fourth and latest offering, which raised $2.5 billion, was reportedly the biggest IPO of 2025 so far based on gross proceeds. This business model—raising capital and using it to buy Bitcoin—isn’t just about holding crypto. Saylor believes it turns volatile digital assets into refined securities that can appeal to professional investors. He called the new offering, branded as “Stretch” (STRC), the company’s most exciting product yet. Saylor also spoke about how other companies are joining the Bitcoin movement. He said that more than 160 public companies now hold Bitcoin in their reserves, compared to around 60 a year ago. Public companies in total own about 955,048 BTC, which is 4.55% of the total supply. He added that Bitcoin is starting to replace traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even equity as a store of value. Saylor argued that Bitcoin is “demonetizing” these older asset classes. For companies looking to increase value for shareholders, he suggested that putting money into Bitcoin makes more sense than holding onto cash or buying things like private equity. Saylor made it clear that his company isn’t trying to hoard the whole supply of Bitcoin. While he thinks owning 3% to 7% of it isn’t “too much,” he stressed that Strategy wants others to have a share too. He pointed out that BlackRock, through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), actually holds more BTC—around 740,896 at the moment. He also mentioned why big tech firms like Apple and Microsoft don’t buy each other’s stocks or S&P 500 companies. According to him, SEC rules stop them from doing that, so they’re limited to buying back their own shares. Saylor believes that if these rules didn’t exist, many of the large tech companies would likely invest in each other—and maybe even Bitcoin.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs Set A New Record In July With $5.4 Billion Monthly Inflow

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a powerful show of investor confidence, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke all records in July with $5.43 billion in net inflows. It marks the highest monthly inflow since their market debut and reflects a sharp 369% rise from June’s inflow of $1.16 billion. With 20 straight days of net inflows, spot ETH ETFs are now cementing Ethereum’s growing role as a leading digital asset in the eyes of traditional market participants. According to data from SoSoValue, the $5.43 billion net inflow in July also dwarfed May’s $564 million and April’s $66.25 million. It completely reversed the negative outflow trend seen in March, which saw a $403 million drop. As a result of this rise, cumulative net inflows across all spot Ether ETFs have now reached $9.64 billion, showing a 129% increase compared to June’s cumulative total. The massive growth didn’t stop at inflows alone. Total net assets across all spot ETH ETFs jumped to $21.52 billion, doubling from $10.32 billion just a month earlier. These funds now account for 4.77% of Ethereum’s entire market capitalization, showing that ETFs are becoming a gateway for capital entering the ETH market. Institutional interest has played a role in this growth as BlackRock’s ETHA remains the leading spot Ethereum ETF by assets, pulling in $18.18 million on July 31 and now holding $11.37 billion. Fidelity’s FETH also gained $5.62 million that same day, raising its net assets to $2.55 billion. Grayscale’s ETHE still manages a solid $4.22 billion asset base, even with a $6.8 million outflow, showing its continued relevance. The record-setting ETF inflows also lined up with a sharp price rally in ETH throughout July. ETH started the month at $2,486 and climbed to a high of $3,933, an increase of nearly 60%. By the end of the month, it had settled at $3,698, making July Ethereum’s strongest monthly price move since October 2021. The steady rise in ETF inflows could be a key driver behind this surge, showing that more capital entering the space may have directly boosted market sentiment and pricing. The ETH rally also marked the longest bullish monthly candle in nearly three years. As prices climbed, the spot ETFs recorded their longest-ever streak of daily net inflows, 20 days in a row without a single outflow after July 8. Some of the single-day gains came mid-month, including $726.7 million on July 16, $602 million on July 17, and $533.8 million on July 22. Ethereum could challenge its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021, as its rising role in decentralized finance and the growing use of regulated investment vehicles could help the asset. If the current pace of inflows and trading activity continues, it could soon take center stage in a broader altcoin-led market cycle. My name is Sandra White. I am a graduate.

The global financial system, or what we broadly refer to as TradFi (Traditional Finance), is a $30+ trillion behemoth. Its reach spans commercial banking, global banking assets, insurance, capital markets, wealth management, and asset servicing. It touches every person, business, and institution, underpinning how value flows through the world. Meanwhile, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), despite being the most transformational innovation to hit financial services in decades, remains a mere rounding error in that picture. Depending on how you measure it, via Total Value Locked (TVL), DeFi token market cap, protocol revenue, or institutional activity, DeFi’s footprint barely scratches $150 billion on a good day. That’s less than half a percent of TradFi’s scope. This is not a failure. It is a testament to just how early we are. Seen more optimistically, it is an opening that holds the blueprint for the future of finance. Already, we’ve seen DeFi recreate core banking functions entirely on-chain, including borrowing, lending, insurance, trading, asset management, and structured products. And it’s working. Millions of users, thousands of developers, and hundreds of projects are coalescing around this future. DeFi’s growth, however, has been largely inward-looking, driven by crypto-native users rather than institutional money. And despite DeFi’s rapid-fire innovation, leading TradFi figures have mostly elected to watch from the sidelines, or worse, confine themselves to dismissive skepticism. This underscores the need for a bridge between the old and the new. TradFi must integrate with DeFi, not just observe it. Not to co-opt it, but to scale it. Fortunately, there is a precedent for such integration. Consider BlackRock’s game-changing embrace of Bitcoin ETFs in 2023–2024 (and later ETH). It didn’t just lend legitimacy, it unlocked institutional access at scale. Today, BlackRock has become the single largest TradFi driver of crypto adoption. It manages over $87 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF assets and $10 billion in ETH ETFs. BlackRock is also leading in DeFi-adjacent areas. Its BUIDL fund, a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund issued mostly on Ethereum via Securitize, holds over $2.4 billion, almost 10% of the $25 billion tokenized asset market on-chain. It’s a direct example of TradFi using DeFi infrastructure without compromising regulatory standards. Meanwhile, JP Morgan’s Kinexys division is working to bring financial assets on-chain. It has tested on-chain FX, repo, and tokenized bonds using permissioned DeFi liquidity pools. It is building infrastructure that mimics DeFi mechanics while staying within institutional compliance rails. This isn’t a crypto experiment; it’s the beginning of institutional DeFi. Then there is Fidelity, long known for its crypto-forward stance, which is quietly expanding its digital assets platform and exploring staking, custody, and tokenized financial products. It has the trust of pension funds and family offices—the very cohort most likely to embrace DeFi once it’s wrapped in a familiar product interface. Fidelity could lead by building regulated DeFi index products or permissioned vaults for clients. Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are also making moves with pilot projects to tokenize money market funds, with fast settlement and interoperability across digital networks. Goldman’s private blockchain and BNY’s LiquidityDirect are testing tokenized fund redemptions, a gateway to replicating DeFi yield mechanics inside TradFi. UBS, Citi, HSBC, and Standard Chartered have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and custody infrastructure projects. These banks are particularly well-positioned to onboard emerging-market clients and sovereign wealth with DeFi-wrapped TradFi products. Not every TradFi sector, though, is equally ripe for a shift to DeFi. The two verticals where adoption is most likely to break through are the Asset Management and Treasury Markets, as well as the Securities Lending and Repo Markets. Tokenized treasuries, like BlackRock’s BUIDL, are just the beginning. Expect asset managers to create programmable yield products, combining DeFi vault strategies with real-world assets (RWAs). This is attractive for institutions sitting on large cash balances, because DeFi-native strategies offer higher yields and transparent collateralization. On the Lending and Repo side, DeFi can enable instant, auditable, and programmable collateral exchanges with reduced counterparty risk. JPMorgan’s experiments in tokenized repo trading are just the start. A permissioned version of Aave or Morpho could gain traction here. Just as crypto exchanges wrapped peer-to-peer transactions in slick UX, TradFi needs to wrap DeFi in user-friendly and compliant interfaces. That’s the blueprint for TradFi and DeFi collaboration. TradFi doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel. But it can add polish, regulatory clarity, and scale to existing DeFi primitives. Custodians can integrate liquid staking. Banks can offer tokenized money market funds on-chain. Asset managers can issue yield-bearing DeFi vaults with KYC wrappers. All of the ingredients are in place. For now, TradFi has the balance sheets and DeFi has the blueprints. The future belongs to those who build the bridge. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Fed Could Slash Rates by 50 Basis Points in September After Weak Jobs Report, Says BlackRock Executive: Report

BlackRock executive Rick Rieder reportedly thinks the U.S. Federal Reserve could slash rates by 50 basis points in September. Rieder, the asset management giant’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note to clients that Friday’s tepid jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics could convince the Fed to institute a larger cut than expected, according to a new report from CNBC. “If slack in the labor force builds at all, or we continue to see a below 100,000 jobs hiring rate persistently, we would expect the Fed to start moving rates lower, and a 50-basis point cut in September might be possible depending on how the data evolves.” The new labor report indicated total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 73,000 jobs in July, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 100,000. The CME FedWatch Tool, which generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices, estimates there’s an 80.3% chance the Fed will cut the federal target rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September, up from 37.7% on Thursday. However, the tool currently estimates there’s zero chance of a 50-basis-point cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this week that no decisions have been made about September’s potential policy choices.

Title: Reasons to love Dublin right now: 52 of our favourite things about the city
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/08/02/reasons-to-love-dublin-right-now-52-of-our-favourite-things-about-the-city/
Time Published: 2025-08-02T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Louis McNeice nailed it eight decades ago when he immortalised our capital city in his poem Dublin: “But yet she holds my mind/With her seedy elegance ... The glamour of her squalor, The bravado of her talk.” Ah, Dublin. The seedily-elegant city gets an awfully hard time these days. The housing crisis looms large, as do the apart-hotels springing up everywhere, not to forget the dilapidation that has always dogged our dirty old town. For years each winter, New York magazine has celebrated that city with its Reasons to Love New York Right Now edition. Inspired by them, we’re celebrating all that is great about Dublin. We know she has plenty of problems (scarlet for you, Temple Bar) but when we asked our contributors for examples of all that is brilliant right now about the capital we couldn’t hold them back: cultural happenings, community activism, remarkable watering holes, diverse food offerings and absurdities such as a few cherry tomatoes on a bridge becoming a bona-fide tourist attraction. We’re not blind to the city’s shortcomings (or overpriced pints) but what follows is a celebration of the capital in all her current glory. The magic, the mischief and the unexpected moments that make Dublin one of the best little towns in the world. So here are some of the many reasons why we love Dublin right now ... (With thanks to Róisín Ingle, Corinna Hardgrave, Una Mullally, Roe McDermott, Olivia Kelly, Conor Pope, Emer McLysaght, Deirdre McQuillan, Sorcha Pollak, Conor Capplis, Rebecca Daly, Niamh Browne, Joanne Cronin, Malachy Clerkin, Madeleine Lyons, Laura Slattery, Cathal O’Gara, Gemma Tipton and Ella Sloane). Because the Hacienda is holding out against gentrification. Shay is one of Dublin’s most beloved publicans. Always sporting an untied bow tie hung over a jazzy waistcoat and shirt, along with his signature coloured glasses, perhaps his greatest contemporary achievement is buttressing a unique bar from TikTok-loving tourists who confuse character with content. The pub – its exterior mimics a traditional Spanish cottage – has been there for decades in the market area between Capel Street and Smithfield. After you buzz the “bar” bell, and Shay cracks the iron-gated door, gives you the once over, and – if you’re lucky, or a regular – grants entry, inside you’ll find a magical pub stuck in time, with its nautical theme, pool tables, and a jukebox that always reverts to The Eagles. Intimate and lively, quaint and fun, it is also beloved by visiting artists looking for a down-to-earth spot to grab a pint, or to celebrate film premieres and arena tours (Taylor Swift booked it out for the after-party following her trio of concerts at the Aviva Stadium last summer). Sure, you can have a star on Hollywood Boulevard, but everyone knows that a framed photograph of you next to Shay on the wall of the Haci is the sign you’ve really made it. Now surrounded by apart-hotels, The Hacienda represents a space and attitude holding out against the homogenous corporate gentrification of the city. ... and the Cobblestone lives on. One of the great people’s victories in Dublin in recent years was the success of the Cobblestone protest. The pub – a bastion of traditional music, song, dance, and the Irish language – was threatened with a hotel development in 2021. Artists and audiences alike sprang into action, holding protests in Smithfield and at the headquarters of Dublin City Council. Planning permission ultimately refused; culture was one of the reasons cited. The energy of this successful protest speaks to the thriving traditional music scene in the city, from which many brilliant, boundary-pushing contemporary acts have emerged. Away from the din of amplified tourist-baiting live music in Temple Bar, you’ll still find authentic sessions in pubs across the city, and core to those is the Cobblestone. Because the Chamomile Club is proving Dublin can still be an exciting place for young artists. One of the most exciting collectives to come out of the city in recent years, the Chamomile Club encompasses parties, club nights, and music releases, featuring some of Ireland’s most exciting acts, including Monjola, Moio, and Aby Coulibaly. From block parties on Fade Street to garden parties at Orlagh House, and events at The Workman’s Club, The Complex, or other “secret locations”, their line-ups, design, and all-round energy is elevated and exciting. Other Dublin collectives, spaces and bands with a radical spirit include Dublin Digital Radio, Unit 44, and Bricknasty. Dublin is an expensive place to live, underserved with cultural spaces, and bigger cities are always calling. Yet these young artists and collectives are holding firm and inspiring others. Because the IFI and the Lighthouse are churches for film nerds. The seats are comfy, the coffee’s good, the staff are all delightful film nerds, and the foyers feel like somewhere you might accidentally meet the love of your life. Arthouse cinema in Dublin is alive and well, with the IFI hosting the Family Film Festival this August, while the Lighthouse’s programme is packed with the best new films as well as special screenings of classics like In The Mood For Love and Stanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon. Events like Cinema Book Club, GAZE and regular Q & As with writers and directors make these cinemas cultural hubs where no one will judge you for crying at a documentary about sheep. And if they do, they’re in the wrong cinema. Because pottery fever is catching in the Liberties. Nestled away on Mill Street in the Liberties, you’ll find a clay haven. Throwing Shapes is “the equivalent of Ballymaloe, but for clay,” says its founder Síofra Murdock, a ceramicist from Co Down who is as cheery and colourful as the pieces on display in her studio. Curious passersby can’t help but peer through the giant windows, plastered with bold red lettering – “Your Community Ceramics Studio” – to see what’s going on. It’s a hub of activity, hosting workshops, talks and markets that attract queues down the street. The shelves are lined with hundreds of creations, decorative and functional, at varying degrees of completion – some already fired and glazed, others still blank canvases. Having just celebrated its first birthday in May, the magnetic force of the studio grows stronger by the week. One member has even packed up and moved house to have the pottery wheels within arm’s reach. Murdock has hand-built a thriving clay community. Come and get your hands dirty. Because a Dublin storytelling event has gone global. Seanchoíche is a pop-up story telling night which encourages speakers to share personal anecdotes, prose, monologues, and spoken word. It gets its name from an amalgamation of seanchaíthe (the Irish for storytellers) and oíche (the Irish for night). The event, conceived in the Unesco city of literature, now runs in Belfast, Limerick, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Melbourne. The night recently ran a slot on the Greenpeace Stage at Glastonbury – and if it’s cool enough for Glasto, it’s cool enough for us. Because the Silent Book Club at Mish Mash Café is a balm for the overstimulated brain. Silent Book Club comes with no pressure, no awkward icebreakers, no demands. Just turn up, order a coffee, read your book. For an hour or two, people sit in a hush that feels unusually generous – alone, together. The only thing you have to bring is a book and maybe the unspoken hope that the world can still make space for quiet, slow, communal moments. For introverts, it’s heaven. For everyone else, it’s an excellent excuse to finally read that novel. Because it’s brilliant for live music. From blockbuster headliners like Taylor Swift at the Aviva and Bruce Springsteen at Croke Park, to up-and-coming Irish talent taking to the stage in the Academy or international indie acts playing the Olympia, Dublin easily pulls the live music weight of a city three times its size. It’s not just the venues themselves that are special, but festivals such as Kilmainham’s Forbidden Fruit and In The Meadows, to the propulsive dance beats of Longitude in Marlay Park. Catch emerging acts at smaller festivals like Whelan’s We’ve Only Just Begun and Workman’s Next Big Thing. Because we have the greatest (art) show on earth for free. In other capital cities people line up to pay admission to art galleries. In Dublin you can see Caravaggio, Vermeer (one of only 34 in the whole world) and more for absolutely nothing at the National Gallery. Or wander into the Hugh Lane, for their heart-soothing Impressionist collection, alongside the world-famous Francis Bacon Studio. Right now, Ailbhe Ní Bhriain’s hauntingly beautiful Dream Pool Intervals is on show there too, ending September 28th. Because our contemporary art museum is so much more. An art gallery you can do yoga at? Tick. Not only does the Irish Museum of Modern Art have a collection that’s jam packed with goodies (Daphne Wright, Dorothy Cross, Alice Maher – and that’s just for starters), their summer programme adds drop in yoga in the formal gardens on Wednesday lunchtimes and Thursday evenings all summer long. Add outdoor art films on Living Canvas, coffee in the courtyard, music and free workshops to get your arty buzz on and find out more at imma.ie. Did someone say art is stuffy, formal and elitist? Not in Dublin. Because a few cherry tomatoes on a bridge can turn into a tourist attraction. Nobody knows who started it. Nobody cares. What began last January as a few cherry tomatoes frozen during a cold snap on Binns Bridge in Drumcondra evolved into an unlikely tourist attraction. On Google Maps, it was known as “the Shrine of the Sacred Cherry Tomatoes of Drumcondra”. Locals and tourists flocked to pay homage with ketchup sachets, basil bouquets and, in one high-art twist, AI-generated portraits of tomatoes in tuxedos. Influencers filmed it. Poets wrote tomato-based tributes. The bridge, inevitably, got millions of views on TikTok. A tourist from Zimbabwe told one newspaper that while he’d been to see the Phoenix Park “so far my favourite thing is the Cherry Tomato Bridge”. “Rotten tomatoes,” complained the critics. “Salad days,” countered the fans. Either way, it captured something ephemeral about the communal absurdity to be found in Dublin. Dublin City Council Spoilsports Department were quick to clean it all up, but we’ll always have the memories. Because Dublin pub quizzes are the best craic. Every night of the week in Dublin there’s a Quizteam Aguilera or a Trivia Newton John vying for glory in the great leveller of social activities, the pub quiz. A good team name is almost more important than how you do. From The Woolshed on Parnell Street to Dudley’s on Thomas Street you’ll get more old favourites like Quiz Quiztofferson and Universally Challenged, along with some more local flavour like Let Quizty Take It or A Tráth Called Ceist. The weekly Wednesday quiz at The Circular in Rialto often sells out and combines friendly vibes, at least four dog mascots, and healthy rivalry between returning teams and newbies alike. Losers get whatever the host Colin McKeown bought earlier in the shop across the road, so even if the scores plummet there might be a Toffee Crisp in it for you. Colin runs Quiz Host Ireland and says it’s community that brings people back again and again: “Simply that we gather together and join a bigger group”. His favourite team name ever? “Padraig Pearsed Nipples.” Because sound Dubs still play along with the Viking Splash Tour. Those giant yellow second World War era amphibious vehicles trundle around the city, spitting facts about Dúbh Linn and pointing out that the Pepper Canister Church is so-called because it ... looks like a pepper canister. The favourite activity of the Viking Splash is creeping up on unsuspecting pedestrians to roar at them. It is the best of sports who pretends not to see them coming and then gets a “big fright” followed by a wave to all the marauders on-board. The Viking Splash has become so beloved in Dublin that when it appeared back on the streets after the Covid lockdowns it was taken as a positive sign that the city was healing. Spare a thought though for those who live or work along the route. It can’t be easy hearing those impassioned “aarrgghhs!” multiple times a day. Because soon you’ll be able to make free phone calls from a retro phone box in the Little Museum of Dublin. Newly reopened in its original home in a Georgian town house on the northside of St Stephen’s Green, the back yard of the Little Museum of Dublin will shortly be home to an old-school cream and green phone box. Once a familiar sight on Parkgate Street and later Dawson Street, the K1 phone kiosk is one of only two examples of this iconic phone box still left – the other is in Foxrock village where it’s a decorative suburban quirk that also houses a well-used book exchange. When the phone box lands in the museum in August it will become the only functioning K1 phone kiosk in the State. After a restoration project, Eir has donated the kiosk to the Little Museum ensuring that this piece of telecommunications heritage is safeguarded for future generations. Soon visitors to the museum will be able to experience the unique phone box and even, thanks again to Eir, make phone calls anywhere in Ireland for free. Because Dublin Zoo now has animatronic dinosaurs. The affection Ireland has for Dublin Zoo was evident in the concern many felt last summer when illness struck the elephant herd leaving two of the beloved beasts dead. It was also on display at the height of the Covid pandemic when people dug deep to fund food for the animals when the zoo was on its knees after months of lockdown. The zoo in 2025 is almost entirely unrecognisable from the one conceived in the Rotunda Hospital in 1830 when a group of medics and scientists formed the Zoological Society of Ireland. Back then it was largely for the entertainment of wealthy Dubliners, with the entrance fee set at a hefty six pence – or nearly €100 in today’s money. Sundays were for normal people – as long as they could afford to spend a single penny. Now spread over 28 hectares, the zoo attracts more than 1 million visitors a year as Ireland’s largest family attraction. And a day at the zoo got even better earlier this year when the 700 animals were joined by animatronic dinosaurs. Because Trinity College is an oasis in the bustling capital Right bang in the city centre you can step away from the busy streets into a 430-year-old college that is an oasis of tranquillity and architectural beauty. On a summer’s day you can even walk past the playing fields to the Pavilion Bar and sit on the steps outside watching the cricket (no understanding of the rules required). Because our seagulls think they own the place. They look down on us, they threaten our sandwiches, they play havoc with rubbish bags and poo on our cars. They cackle, they chortle, they screech and scream and yet Dublin wouldn’t be Dublin without seagulls. Bloom feeds them in Ulysses, one of several notable references to the birds in James Joyce’s novel. Dublin has the densest urban gull population in Ireland; they’ve been nesting in the city since the 1970s due to declining food sources at sea and closure of landfills – now estimated to number around 10,000 breeding pairs. Yet, despite this rise, the overall herring gull population in Ireland has dropped by 90 per cent in the past 30-40 years. As they tell us what we have done to our environment – and theirs – we should look up to them. Because the clip-clop of horses is still the soundscape of the inner city. Many cities have horse and carriage tours for tourists, but in Dublin, this goes much deeper. Caring for horses is an intrinsic part of the city’s culture – as well as Traveller culture – to this day. Around Dublin 7 and 8, it’s not uncommon to see young people walking horses through the streets, or trotting on sulkies. Concerns are often raised over animal welfare and the future of the Smithfield horse fair. But talk to a kid in the city with a horse by their side, and they’ll furnish you with plenty of details about the horse’s personality and how they care for them. If only the city could contribute more to enhancing the care of horses by providing new funding for stables, and acknowledging that this culture should be protected and supported with animal welfare as a priority. Because Dubliners can talk to anyone. There’s a particular magic in the Dubliner’s ability to talk absolute nonsense – and mean it. Not just weather chat, but miniature theatre: timing, wit, warmth. Whether it’s the butcher, the barista, or the person beside you on the 13, you’ll get a comment, a joke, a “will you look at that state of the sky”. It’s not meaningless – it’s micro-connection. People who deride the power of small talk are unaware of its important psychological benefits. Small talk – particularly those small chats you have with people you see regularly such as shopkeepers and regulars on your bus route – has been proven to promote a greater sense of safety, belonging and community. It’s not a coincidence that we are discussing loneliness and isolation at a time where people are more likely to put headphones on than say hi to your barista. Great small talk is a form of connection and it’s also a cultural skill we should be proud to protect and cultivate. Because “For All” groups are bringing communities together. Scores of volunteer and community groups have sprang up across Ireland in response to an increase in asylum seeker arrivals and anti-immigrant protests. In Dublin, many of these “For All” groups have evolved into a network of engagement for the wider community, says Roxanna Nic Liam, a member of the East Wall for All group. “These groups integrate not just asylum seekers, but locals who have been in the community for generations,” she says. “East Wall for All showed us how a working-class area in Dublin really does come together in a crisis and make the area a better place.” Liam Hourican of Dublin 8 For All says the group’s membership has rapidly grown following recent anti-immigrant protests outside two primary schools in Dublin 8. “People were disturbed by the rise of hateful narrative. We think an attack on marginalised members of our community is an attack on all our community.” Dublin 8 For All “makes our community richer”, says Hourican. “This is what our country should be about – we should be open and confident and kind to each other.” Because Dublin keeps showing it solidarity with Palestine. Dublin has long been a focal point for protest and activism in Ireland, and over the past year, it has become a powerful centre for solidarity with Palestine. From the Garden of Remembrance to the gates of Leinster House, tens of thousands have taken to the streets. Palestinian flags hang from shop windows, business awnings and private homes, a sign of collective outrage and empathy. This surge in solidarity is part of a broader, deeply rooted activist spirit in Dublin, where people have repeatedly gathered to reshape Ireland’s national identity, from the Repeal the 8th movement to the Marriage Equality referendum. The same streets that once echoed with calls for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ equality now resound with chants for justice in Gaza. Because Capel Street is Dublin’s best car-free street. You can keep Grafton Street and Henry Street. Not only is Capel Street longer, it is distinctly better suited to exploit the advantages of a traffic-free environment because it has what the others lack – pubs and restaurants. Retail-dominated Grafton Street and Henry Street are dead once the shops close, but life continues into the evening on Capel Street, pedestrianised in 2022, particularly in summer when people can dine outdoors. During the day, the new public seating is well-used by shoppers taking a rest, teenagers socialising, tourists checking out what their next destination should be, and workers availing of an outdoor space to have lunch. Instead of car fumes and the noise of traffic, now there is the sound of conversation. Instead of pedestrian safety being compromised by vehicles, now there are plants to enjoy. ... followed by Parliament Street. Facing Capel Street across Grattan Bridge, bookended by the Liffey and City Hall, tree-lined Parliament Street was pedestrianised in July. The removal of traffic has the potential to rebalance Temple Bar, drawing more tourists from the busier east end to the West. It is also a big gain for cycling, with a new contraflow lane on Grattan Bridge allowing cyclists to go in both directions from City Hall on Dame Street, along Capel Street and all the way to Bolton Street – a distance of almost 1km. Because the quays are no longer a traffic choked hellscape. Described as a “watery dual carriageway” by Dublin City Council’s head of traffic Brendan O’Brien, the quays served no one – not cyclists, not pedestrians, not bus users, not even the private car drivers who were the largest contributors to its congestion. That has changed. Last summer the council banned private cars and commercial vehicles travelling along the Liffey at either side of O’Connell Bridge from 7am to 7pm. City car parks remained accessible, no Liffey bridge was closed to cars, and once 7pm hit, it was back to the status quo. Yet this one small measure had a transformative effect on traffic. The provision for cyclists is still poor, but the big winners are Dublin’s bus users. Rush hour bus journey times fell by almost a third and timetable accuracy increased. Some motorists still ignore the restrictions, but hopefully the planned introduction of traffic light cameras will sort them out. Because slowly, surely, soul-enhancingly, our city is becoming greener. As the cycleways and pedestrianised areas have expanded, so too have little pockets of green. Whether it’s more trees along the new cycle paths in North Strand or vertical planting out of the bases of old brick walls in the Liberties or St James Linear Park running along the Luas red line in Rialto, these are imaginative, in many cases inexpensive, interventions that go a long way to softening the city’s rougher edges. Cabra is full of brilliant examples such as the Community Roots garden-sharing initiative which matches people who want to grow their own food with others who have space and are happy to share. Then there’s the Cabra Pond, built without a pond liner using bentonite clay, has transformed the area behind the Most Precious Blood Church off Kilkieran Road. The pond is full of tiny frogs at the moment with plenty of swifts soaring overhead – boxes for the birds were organised by Connecting Cabra. Catriona Kenny, a member of that group, says local churches have been generous with their land: “We’ve held biodiversity festivals there, and planted long flowering meadows, native hedgerows and even a mini orchard. A local flood-alleviating project is ongoing around Christ the King Church, to reduce pressure on our storm drains.” Well played, Cabra. Because our traffic junctions have become public works of art. It all started 10 years ago as part of the Dublin Canvas community art project. Artists were asked to come up with ideas for painting over the grey, and much graffitied, traffic light control boxes with all manner of eye-catching art. These brightly painted boxes bring welcome flashes of creativity and colour to otherwise boring bits of street furniture at most junctions throughout the city and suburbs. With another batch commissioned for painting over the coming months, there will be more than 900 spread out across Dublin by autumn. Because our walls talk back. Street artists like Joe Caslin and Emmalene Blake make the city feel alive. Caslin’s soaring portraits – of queer teens, grieving men, hopeful change – don’t just beautify walls, they demand tenderness. Emmalene Blake’s work started with portraiture and has now become more political: hand-painted girls, mothers, and martyrs who quietly reclaim space for care, queerness, and Palestine. In a city often accused of being scrubbed of character, these artists murals remind you what still matters, responding to social crises and political events in real time, turning empty space into activism and concrete into feeling. You look up, and suddenly the city’s talking back. Because people sit anywhere, anytime, anyhow. The provision of public seating in some areas of the city is finally improving, but elsewhere, Dubliners still have to take a load off by sitting on the street, as they have always done. Back in the day, the steps of the Central Bank were where young people gathered, and an ecosystem of subcultures merged; ravers, rockers, goths, grunge heads, skaters, and emo kids. Then it was the steps of the Powerscourt Shopping Centre on South William Street. While the banks of the canals and the boardwalk are well-worn sitting spots, now it’s the kerbs of Drury Street, Castle Market and Fade Street where you’ll find the city’s cool kids hanging out. (The pedestrianisation of South William Street remains in limbo; this could revitalise a street that was once buzzing, but is now pockmarked by vacancy.) Because the Clontarf to city centre cycleway is glorious. Since the early 1990s cyclists heading north from Clontarf have had a traffic free path to enjoy the fabulous vista of Dublin Bay opening up before them, until, that is, they were chucked out unceremoniously at the Wooden Bridge to contend with traffic for a 2km stretch. In 2017 this missing link in the cycle-path was filled in and all was well, unless you were a cyclist heading south from Clontarf, then you were left to dice with death all the way into town. But no more. Last November the Clontarf to city centre cycle route opened. This 2.7km route takes cyclists all the way from the end of the Clontarf promenade to Conolly Station on Amiens Street, but more than that, it offers connections, existing and planned, to a whole network of safe segregated cycle routes. Already cyclists can use it to join the Royal Canal Greenway at Newcomen Bridge and Dublin Port’s new Tolka Estuary Geenway via Fairview Park. In future, the route will be extended from Amiens Street down to the Liffey side paths and one day, if the council implements its Sandymount Strand Road plans, it will be connected to the southside and eventually the long-awaited Sutton to Sandycove (S2S) cycle-path along Dublin Bay could be completed. Because the new S bus routes offer a whole new way to explore the city. Rather than follow the old centripetal pattern of draining humanity into the city centre where people often had to hop off and hop on another bus to get where they wanted to go, the new S buses run across the city. The S2 for example goes from Heuston Station to Sandymount, through the city centre. ... and everyone still thanks the bus driver when getting off. Even if people now have to disembark via the middle doors, they still shout “thanks” up to the driver. And unless you’re wielding a knife the drivers almost always let you travel even if you don’t have change or didn’t know they don’t take e-payments (in this day and age!). Because sea swimming is now a religion with better robes. Irish people have a deep relationship with the sea; we turn to it as a form of escape, of calm, of emotional regulation. Whether you’re partial to Seapoint, Bull Wall, the Forty Foot or Vico Baths, there’s no such thing as off-season: the sea is always there for you. And even if you go alone, there’s a sense of community in being one of the mad ones who embraces the cold at any time of year. The reasons vary – mental health, community, a daily dopamine hit – but the feeling is universal: euphoria, followed by a hot flask of tea and a smug glow that lasts all day. ... and you can swim beside Moglaí Bap from Kneecap at Clontarf Baths. Swimming outdoors in Dublin with the reassurance of a seawater filter was a weirdly impossible dream until relatively recently, but this joyfully jellyfish-free option is now available at Clontarf Baths (€10 for two hours, clontarfoutdoorpool.com). Originally built in the 1880s, the baths reopened after a 22-year hiatus in 2018, initially only for swimming club members, before public sessions were added in 2022. The pool tends to be a few degrees warmer than actual sea temperature, though it might not feel that way if you brave it outside the summer months. With its expansive dimensions, it is an invigorating, open secret swim spot. Moglaí Bap from Kneecap presumably agrees – he was spotted enjoying the baths when the band were in town for their gig at Fairview Park in balmy June. Because saunas have become the new pubs. Forget meeting people for a meal or a drink, the new way to socialise is by sweating together in a sauna, with new ones opening in recently in almost every Dublin postcode, from Killiney to Swords, Dundrum to Ballsbridge. One of our favourites is the Hot Box Sauna in Inchicore, an area recently named as one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world by Time Out. Because there’s a run club for everyone. Dubliners are embracing new ways of socialising and boosting their health while they are at it, and with a great selection of parks and walkways, it seems only natural. From singles, to gaeilgeoirs to members of the LGBTQ community to asylum seekers, there’s a run club to suit all interests, whether you’re looking to train for a marathon or simply jog 5k; some of the most popular include Sanctuary Runners, Dublin Front Runners, Sole Mates, Run Club Social and Club Reatha. Because Gay Spar is still the best place to feel seen at 2am. Officially known as the Spar on Dame Street, unofficially known as Gay Spar, this 24-hour convenience store is also a safe haven. So-called due to its proximity to The George, “Gay Spar” started as a nickname – but the shop has wholeheartedly embraced it, with windows now emblazoned with rainbow Pride colours. When you stumble in after the club, before the taxi, when your eyeliner’s smudged and your voice is hoarse, you can be safe in the knowledge that you’re not the only glitter-covered person buying a Lucozade and a sausage roll. At a time where corporate LGBTQ+ allyship – no matter how performative – is being rolled back worldwide, Gay Spar has proven to be a steadfast ally. Because some shops are more than just shops. Around the city, independent stores add to the diversity of retail, breaking up the monotony of international chains. Many of these brick-and-mortar stores also act as cultural hubs. Saint Street hosts sessions by local rappers. Emma Fraser’s vintage clothing stores Loot and Nine Crows have expanded into an internationally lauded modelling agency Not Another Agency. Tola Vintage hosts Culture Night parties, and High Rollers has a skate team. At Indigo & Cloth’s micro-cafe, actors, artists, playwrights and crew from the nearby Project Arts Centre grab a brew. Emporium collaborates with the club Index and the record label Soft Boy, home to Kean Kavanagh and Kojaque. Owner of Little Deer Comics Matthew Melis is founder of the Dublin Comic Arts Festival. What all these stores have in common is an independent spirit, a can-do attitude, and a belief that community is what makes a city business tick. Because Stable and The Irish Design Shop are beacons of Irish design. If there’s one shop in Dublin city centre that lifts the spirits in an otherwise mediocre line up of global fashion brands found in any European capital, it is Stable in the Westbury Mall. Founded by friends Sonia Reynolds and Frances Duff originally as a pop-up ten years ago, it celebrates its ongoing success in promoting Irish craftsmanship and native fabrics, designing and making scarves, clothing and home accessories using Irish linen, tweed and handwoven wool. For crafts and jewellery, The Irish Design Shop on nearby Drury Street can’t be beaten. Because indie bookshops are still holding the line. In Books Upstairs, you can climb the stairs to a cafe filled with poetry books and political theory. In The Gutter Bookshop, the staff recommend novels with such genuine joy it feels like a gift. In Hodges Figgis, a 300-hundred-year-old institution, you can still overhear a teenager discovering Sylvia Plath. The best ones – like The Library Project in Temple Bar, with its photo books and zines – remind you that books aren’t just stories, they’re worlds, and Dublin still has places where you can stumble into them. Events like Rick O’Shea’s Writehawks, which allows writers to come in and chat about their favourite books, create a sense of community. Because the George’s Street Arcade is as odd as ever. Where else could you get a nipple pierced and your fortune told before picking up a kaftan, some handcrafted statement jewellery, a batter burger and an oat-milk latte, all under the one roof? Only in Ireland’s first purpose-built shopping centre. While it’s unlikely the youth of the 1880s – when the George’s Street Arcade first opened its doors – were lining up to get body parts pierced or inked, they were no doubt as drawn to the eclectic mix of stalls and shops as more recent generations have been. And sure as anything they used it as a handy and dry shortcut when walking from George’s Street to Drury Street on a rainy day. The closure of Simon’s Place is still mourned by many, but the arcade continues to be a draw for tourists and locals. Because Kish Fish reminds us what food shopping should be like. Kish opened on a back street in the heart of Smithfield in 1979 when Ireland loved the pope and the notion of north inner-city gentrification was as comically unlikely as a computer company paying us €13 billion in back tax or some class of silicon docks popping up at the back of Irishtown. The fishmongers standing behind the beds of tightly packed ice are old-school and fiercely obliging, happy to fillet and skin whatever takes your fancy and teach you how best to cook it. You won’t find that service in many supermarkets. Because of the second-hand treasure troves. Dublin’s street style is a combo of Pellador jumpers and Claddagh ring emblems, mixed with second-hand finds uncovered in the city’s charity and vintage shops – from the legendary Lucy’s Lounge in Temple Bar and Monto on Parnell Street, to the newer Big Smoke Vintage in Temple Bar. As for the “chazzas”, Dublin has a wonderful selection of shops that follow each other like stepping stones, from Capel Street to George’s Street, Camden Street and into the southside. Because the flea market scene keeps offering new treasures. In 2018, the Dublin Flea Market ceased trading due to redevelopment around Newmarket Square, much to regret of locals and fans of a good bargain. But residents were delighted to welcome the revived Newmarket Flea in July. Elsewhere in the city, Quirk, Le Zeitgeist, Libertine Market Crawl, Flux Market and the Block Market in Charlemont Square have all helped turn thrifting into a social event. Flea markets are a haven of creativity and community, showcasing the best of local artists, crafts and vintage fashion collectors. It’s not just about finding something rare and engaging in a spirit of sustainability as old items become loved again, it’s about chatting to the sellers, grabbing a coffee, and seeing what strange treasure finds you. Because Change Clothes offers us a guilt-free wardrobe refresh while saving clothes from landfill. In 2022, Mary Fleming set up Change Clothes in Crumlin, initially a one-week pop-up devoted to clothes swapping, workshops and exhibitions. Fast forward to 2025 and Mary’s word is spreading far and wide across Dublin. Now based on Thomas Street in Dublin 8, Change Clothes hosts clothes swaps, fill-a-bag events, sewing machine classes and textile upcycling events. Donated clothing is redistributed to people in need, and traineeships are offered to those looking to get started in the textile industry. Change Clothes also enables other social enterprises to host clothes swaps events by providing clothes rails and the know-how. Because the city finally knows how to eat. There was a time when “going out for food” in Dublin meant soggy panini or bafflingly expensive Caesar salads. Not any more. From Filipino adobo tacos to cardamom cruffins to smoked fish toasties made in tiny food trucks, the capital’s kitchens are having a golden age. There’s imagination, care, spice. Pop-ups and wine bars. Places you tell your friends about immediately, unless you want to keep them to yourself. It’s not just fancy spots – it’s the fact that Dubliners now expect their food to taste of something. And it does. New favourites include Little Lemon on Duke Lane, Pickosito on Mary Street, Fidelity in Smithfield, Lupillos in Inchicore, and Cat You Café in Ringsend for the best acai bowl in town, as well as the global streetfood stalls at the recently opened Priory Market in Tallaght. Because Assassination Custard is defying the odds. In a city where independent restaurants are being flattened by rent hikes and global roll-outs, and Dublin dining has blurred into velvet booths, TikTok interiors and menus written by accountants, Ken Doherty and Gwen McGrath’s Assassination Custard in Dublin 8 remains a quiet act of resistance. Opened in 2015, it shut in July 2023 to reassess how – or if – it could go on. It reopened in February, reshaped but not softened: bookings open weekly on Instagram, lunch Wednesday to Friday, with two sittings, 12pm and 1.30pm. Bookings are for one or two people, dining at shared tables, maximum eight people. It’s €35 a head minimum (less if solo). Now serving wine: one red, one white, and a vermouth at €8.50 a glass. The paper-bag menu shifts with the season and their format: always vegetarian options, often offal – tripe, kidneys, hearts – and pickles, ferments, anchovies, and pig’s ear. No PR machine. Two cooks, three tables, and a welcome that proves why small matters. Because Green Man Wines is one of the best wine shops in the world. Rajat Parr – the world’s most revered blind-taster – walked into Green Man Wines in Terenure and, like every wine nerd, did a double take. More than 1,000 lines, from smaller producers who farm organically, biodynamically, “naturally”. Wines with energy, not funk. Most fall into the €20-€40 range, though there are four-figure unicorns. Opened a decade ago by Dave Gallagher and his wife, the late Claire O’Boyle Gallagher, it still reflects their mix of obsession and warmth. All bottles can be opened on-site for €15 corkage. Dan Smith, formerly of Airfield Estate, is the chef in the wine bar (Thursday-Saturday), serving a rotating menu, built around small plates that pair with the wine. “Wine Tasting Wednesdays” bring visiting winemakers pouring their bottles, with Dan riffing on the regional food. Because the world’s best chefs treat Fish Shop like a local. The Smithfield room is tiny – two marble-topped counters, 15 stools, a chalkboard menu, and a killer wine list: Jura whites, grower Champagne, alpine Nebbiolo, island wines from the Med. Peter Hogan and Jumoke Akintola opened Fish Shop here in May 2016, following their Blackrock Market stall. The menu still includes their renowned fish and chips but has quietly grown. The rule remains: wild, Irish-caught fish and seafood only. No tuna, bream, sea bass, imported prawns. Grilled John Dory or brill are mainstays, alternatives include gurnard or red mullet. Shellfish from the Copper Coast – crab, shrimp, lobster, whelks – are delivered from Tramore by Peter, and Irish langoustines or tiny seasonal shrimp, depending on the catch. Famous chefs eat here, of course. International names, tipped off about our restaurant critic Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite casual restaurant in Dublin. Good luck getting a seat. Because the Mushroom Butcher is Dublin’s most original pop-up. Mark Senn, a Melbourne-born chef who once ran the short-lived Veginity and Vish, now grows and cooks mushrooms near Leonard’s Corner in Dublin 8. Mushroom Butcher is his Saturday-only food truck – parked outside a converted retail unit where he and his partner, Ingrid Baceviciute, cultivate a dozen or so delicate, short-shelf-life mushroom varieties rarely seen in Ireland. Staples have included king oyster schnitzel, mushroom XO sauce with polenta chips, and a vegan bánh mì, and more recently, he’s featured a series of themed menus – Brazilian, Japanese, Greek and Italian – all cooked to order. The mushrooms themselves are sold fresh and appear on menus at some of the country’s best restaurants. No delivery. Just a hyper-focused weekly service that’s growing something new – literally, from the ground up. Because Al Khair restaurant at the mosque on South Circular Road is an escape to another culture. At Al Khair, the canteen-style restaurant tucked behind the blue gates of the mosque on South Circular Road, hospitality means food – shared, abundant, unforgettable. Opened in 1985 by Mohammed Yousuf, now run by his son Junaid, the food is what he calls Indian with a “gentle Pakistani influence”, which in practice means you get the creamy warmth of paneer and dal, the deep spice of slow-cooked lamb, and the slap-you-awake heat of aubergine bharta when you ask for it spicy. The vegetarian samosas are wonderful. Because the new generation of cocktail bars rival the best in the world. When Dave Mulligan felt the city needed some old school night-time glamour, he reimagined the old Sackville Lounge off O’Connell Street. This old boozer still has that classic Dublin pub feel, but it’s also new and sleek with a cocktail menu that will knock your socks off. But what else would you expect from head bartender Dave Taylor, who also oversees operations at nearby award-winning Bar 1661? This year, Bar 1661 represented the Irish cocktail scene at the prestigious Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans, showcasing all that is great about Irish spirits and Irish drinks. Because of the secret table in Pepper Pot Café. Most Dubliners know about the pear and bacon sandwich in the Pepper Pot Cafe. (If you don’t, and think pear and bacon come across as unlikely breadfellows, just try it.) Most of us also know the Pepper Pot is one of Dublin’s best cafes for people watching, on the balcony in the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre overlooking the bustling hordes below. But our favourite place to perch is at the table we like to call the secret table. In a room away from the main seating areas, it’s where the cafe’s baking magic happens. Here you can eat your pear and bacon or equally lovely sausage sandwich while watching croissants being laminated and bagel dough being pulled. Now, like Doris Day’s secret love, our secret table’s no secret any more. But that’s okay. We don’t mind sharing. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Five things investors should ponder on crypto

Time Published: 2025-08-02T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
A decade ago half a dozen mavericks assembled in a Swiss house to launch ethereum – a piece of the crypto ecosystem that acts as a distributed computing platform, using the ether token. It initially looked likely to fail: the founding tribe imploded after bitter internal fights; ethereum suffered a large cyber hack; scandals erupted and, like bitcoin, ether’s price became crazily volatile, surging from nothing to $5,000, before collapsing. But this week something striking occurred: just as the White House was issuing a report about the Golden Age of Crypto, the Nasdaq exchange celebrated ethereum’s 10th birthday. “Ethereum has demonstrated itself ... as the definition of antifragile,” enthused Joe Lubin, one former inhabitant of that founding house, who presents the platform as “a reliable trust layer for our fast-growing digital world”. Cynics will undoubtedly wince in horror, while enthusiasts will cheer. No wonder: crypto is arguably the single most divisive issue in finance today. [ Crypto investors need more detailed warnings about risks involved - Central BankOpens in new window ] However, I would suggest that this anniversary should spark a more realistic – and subtle – judgment. For the past decade has revealed at least five key points about crypto that investors should ponder. First, and most obviously, digital assets are not homogenous (even if detractors hate them all). Bitcoin is a one-dimensional phenomenon that fans liken to “digital gold”, while ethereum is a multifaceted infrastructure. Memecoins (like $TRUMP) only float on crazy hype, but stablecoins are supposed to be backed by assets, like treasuries. This matters. Second, we need to move beyond black-and-white thinking with crypto. The evangelists who declared a decade ago that distributed finance would transform the world were wrong – thus far digital assets are still too clunky, costly and energy-guzzling to displace most mainstream payment options, and too volatile to be a reliable store of value. Criminality has been rife. Just think of the saga of Sam Bankman-Fried, or regulatory censure of the tether stablecoin. But doomsayers who predicted crypto’s demise were equally wrong. Digital asset prices have just soared (again), pushing ethereum and bitcoin’s market capitalisation up to $455 billion (€398.6 billion) and $2.3 trillion respectively. And the $270 billion-odd worth of stablecoins in circulation are supported by as many transactions as the Visa credit card network in the last year, as Glenn Hutchins, a long-time tech investor, tells me. Why? Greed (or speculation) is one factor. But crypto is founded on an interesting innovation (blockchain) that can sometimes be useful (say, for some cross-border payments). Moreover, some key players and regulators are raising standards in response to past scandals and networks like ethereum are slashing energy usage. [ A lesson from The Godfather as Wall Street backs crypto assets it once dismissed as a ‘fraud’Opens in new window ] Third, mainstream finance is moving in. This is ironic, given that early crypto evangelists promised that distributed finance would depose incumbents. But it is driving the current boom. Consider the fact that a top BlackRock executive has just joined an ethereum investment group; or that traditional asset managers like Fidelity, BlackRock and Vanguard are launching crypto funds; or how mainstream investors are increasingly using crypto as a diversification play, while banks such as JPMorgan are running their own blockchains and launching stablecoins. Fourth, the geopolitics of crypto are shifting – fast. In the past decade, most innovation occurred outside the United States, in places such as Hong Kong. But this week Paul Atkins, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he wanted to pull it onshore. Why? One reason is that the Trump family itself is invested in crypto. Another is grubby politics: crypto groups were such big Trump donors in 2024 that luminaries tell me they won the election for him. But geofinance matters too. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent hopes that dollar-based stablecoins will create a new source of demand for treasuries, and promote more dollar usage around the world. Consider this a new policy twist on Bretton Woods in the Silicon Valley age. Finally, crypto’s second-order effects could turn out to be even more striking than the digital assets themselves. For what the innovation does is enable us to imagine alternatives to the financial and geopolitical status quo – for instance, by asking if we need to rely on the Swift payment system, or dollar dominance. Don’t get me wrong: by making these five points, I am not downplaying the risks. The Trump administration’s conflicts of interest with crypto are shameful. The potential for consumer harm is real. There are financial stability risks due to crypto’s growing links with mainstream finance, and the use of treasuries to back stablecoins. Criminality and grift exists. But it is possible to worry about these risks – and want better regulation – but at the same time to recognise that the underlying technology can be useful as a geopolitical and financial diversification tool. For these reasons, ethereum’s “birthday” should prompt enthusiasts and doomsayers alike to realise that neither of them is entirely right. Life is rarely black and white – in finance or anywhere else. That will not change even if (or when) ethereum turns 20. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum Taker Sell Volume Hits $335M In Just 2 Minutes: Panic Or Profit-Taking?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum has faced an 8% correction since Monday, cooling off from its recent rally and slipping below the key $3,850 level. This move suggests that the bullish momentum that carried ETH higher in July is beginning to fade, with price now entering a critical consolidation phase. Bulls are still holding key support levels, but the threat of a deeper correction is growing as selling pressure intensifies. On-chain data shows signs of profit-taking from large investors, adding to short-term volatility and uncertainty. Heavy selling volume over the past two days has sparked speculation across the market, especially as Ethereum remains below recent local highs. Analysts are split in their outlook—some argue that this is a healthy pullback within a broader uptrend, while others warn of a potential slide toward the $3,400–$3,500 range if sentiment worsens. Despite the recent drop, Ethereum’s long-term structure remains intact, with fundamentals like growing DeFi usage and Layer 2 adoption continuing to support the narrative. However, the next few days will be critical. If bulls can defend current levels and regain momentum, ETH could attempt another move toward $4,000. If not, the market may see extended downside pressure before a clearer recovery emerges. According to top analyst Maartunn, Ethereum experienced a dramatic spike in taker sell volume, reaching $335 million in just two minutes. This massive wave of sell orders signals a key moment in the market, one that could mark either the peak of profit-taking or the end of panic-driven capitulation. While some interpret the event as large investors securing gains after the recent rally, others believe this could reflect emotional selling from retail traders spooked by short-term volatility. Despite the heavy selling pressure, Ethereum’s long-term bullish narrative remains intact. Large players continue to accumulate, taking advantage of dips and buying from weaker hands. This activity suggests strategic positioning ahead of expected growth in adoption, especially as Ethereum cements its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. ETH spent months in a downtrend earlier this year, weighed down by macro uncertainty and regulatory fears. Yet, while the broader market showed weakness, sophisticated investors appeared to accumulate. Now, with sentiment shifting and the price structure strengthening, Ethereum seems well-positioned for the months ahead. The $335 million sell-off highlights market vulnerability—but also shows that whales are stepping in. If price holds current levels and sentiment stabilizes, Ethereum could see a renewed push toward the $4,000 mark as confidence returns. Ethereum (ETH) has officially broken below its critical resistance zone near $3,860, signaling increased selling pressure and short-term weakness. After maintaining a steady range for nearly two weeks, the price has dropped to $3,619 on the 4-hour chart, finding temporary support just above the 100-period SMA (green line), currently near $3,670. This breakdown comes amid an uptick in bearish volume, suggesting momentum may favor sellers in the short term. The 50-period SMA (blue line), located around $3,762, has now turned into near-term resistance, capping any immediate recovery attempts. If bulls fail to reclaim the $3,760–$3,800 zone, Ethereum could risk deeper downside toward the next key support around $3,175 (200 SMA, red line) or even $2,852, which served as a base in early July. Despite this weakness, the broader trend remains structurally bullish as long as price stays above the 200 SMA. However, bulls must reclaim the $3,860 level and build momentum above it to regain strength. Until then, volatility is expected, especially as profit-taking and macro uncertainty weigh on sentiment.

Δ These RWAs include stocks, bonds, bank deposits and real estate, CoinDesk reported Friday (Aug. 1), citing Bank of America analysts. Investors see opportunities in fractional ownership that broadens access to previously illiquid asset classes, as well as risks of disruption to financial institutions’ transaction services businesses, according to the report. At the same time, there’s a growing belief that financial institutions will adapt to the growing use of blockchain technology, per the report. The tokenization of RWAs is driving an on-chain revolution across capital markets, PYMNTS reported in April. RWAs are tangible or intangible assets that have been tokenized and placed on a blockchain. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token that represents ownership or a claim on an underlying asset. Tokenization of these assets enables organizations and enterprises to take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains, and the tokenization of traditionally illiquid assets makes them easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets. The President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets’ report “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which was released Wednesday (July 30) by the White House, sets expectations for digital asset governance while signaling federal alignment on the need to facilitate innovation — particularly in payments infrastructure and tokenized financial instruments. When asset manager BlackRock unveiled its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, BlackRock’s Web3 partner in the fund, said: “Tokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.” Reports over the last month or so said that JPMorgan is developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, Kraken unveiled a platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities, and Robinhood announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Each of these initiatives moves traditional financial services onto the blockchain, representing a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize RWAs.

Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has addressed critical questions regarding XRP’s role as the crypto firm looks to replace SWIFT. Schwartz indicated that the altcoin was irreplaceable in the firm’s operations despite the issuance of the RLUSD stablecoin. In an X post, Ripple CTO first touched on the question of how the crypto firm has over 300 bank partnerships, but XRP on-chain volume remains low. Schwartz opined that there are several reasons why their clients have preferred to use the altcoin off-chain rather than on-chain. However, he believes that they are close to changing that because institutions are now seeing the benefits of moving on-chain. The Ripple CTO admitted that XRP’s on-chain volume has been very slow. He noted that even the crypto firm can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because they can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Schwartz added that features like permissioned domains will address this issue. Secondly, the Ripple CTO addressed why XRP is still being used over stablecoins for transfers despite its volatility. He explained that there are use cases where volatility isn’t a minus and is instead a plus. He remarked that generally, the view for most digital assets is that the upside outweighs the downside. As such, as long as one isn’t very risk-averse, Schwartz believes that holding the altcoin is not a disadvantage. The next question was about the incentive to hold XRP if volatility isn’t an issue, because it is a bridge currency. The Ripple CTO said that a bridge currency only works if someone is holding it, so they can get it precisely when they need it. He suggested that it may be best to hold XRP, which is the current dominant bridge currency, because it should be cheaper to exchange it into whatever they happen to next. Furthermore, David Schwartz answered whether XRP as a bridge currency will still be necessary when stablecoins cover most pairs in the future. The Ripple CTO answered that if one stablecoin wins, then the altcoin won’t be necessary, as that stablecoin will just serve as the bridge currency. However, the Ripple CTO opined that one stablecoin can’t win for several reasons. This includes the fact that a stablecoin can only be stable relative to one particular fiat currency and will always have jurisdictional ties. As such, Schwartz believes that it still makes sense to have a bridge asset like XRP in this multi-stablecoin world. As to why giants like BlackRock would want to use XRP Ledger for tokenization instead of building their own blockchain, the Ripple CTO doesn’t think that will matter as long as there is interoperability and asset portability. He added that multi-chains are a good form of scalability as well. Meanwhile, on geopolitical risk and why foreign countries would trust a U.S.-based private company payment network, the Ripple CTO clarified that the XRPL is not really U.S.-based. Schwartz further remarked that the network has never discriminated against any particular participant. He also noted that Ripple has separately licensed entities in many jurisdictions for its enterprise payment products, which makes it not restricted to just the U.S. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Larry Fink’s BlackRock loses bid to dismiss Texas climate collusion claims

A US judge on Friday largely rejected a request by top asset managers including BlackRock to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Texas and 12 other Republican-led states that said the companies violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas, agreed to dismiss just three of the 21 counts in the states’ lawsuit, that also names institutional investors State Street and Vanguard. The lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the three companies “created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” and that “today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.” The three asset managers said they would continue to defend against the claims, with Vanguard calling the ruling disappointing, and State Street calling the case a risk to investors and energy markets. “By pursuing forced divestment, the Attorneys General are undermining the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock said. The ruling by Kernodle, who was appointed by President Trump, means the states can move forward with their claims that the asset managers violated US antitrust law by joining Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative to take action to combat climate change, and used their shareholder advocacy in furtherance of its goals. Kernodle, however, dismissed claims that the asset managers violated Louisiana and Nebraska consumer protection laws. The companies have denied wrongdoing and called the case “half-baked.” But the states’ theories garnered support from Trump-appointed antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for how the companies, which together manage some $27 trillion, approach their holdings and passive funds. One possible remedy sought by the plaintiffs would be for the fund firms to divest holdings in coal companies, which BlackRock has said would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices.

Title: Hong Kong firm appeals for legal protection of investors as its Panama Ports contract faces lawsuits

A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions has appealed for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company’s contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions appealed on Friday for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company's contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits in the Central American country. Respect for the rule of law is essential to assure businesses that Panama is a safe place to invest in, Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, said in a statement. Panama’s Comptroller General filed two lawsuits on Wednesday, seeking to declare unconstitutional a contract that granted the operation of ports at both ends of the canal to the Hong Kong subsidiary, and to nullify its renewal four years ago, saying it was “abusive” of Panama's interests. In turn, Panama Ports Company said its operations have had a positive impact, from building world-class ports to creating more than 25,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing billions of balboas — Panama's currency — to the country's economy. It said it wants to work with the government in Panama for a better future. “Regarding the ongoing legal actions, we firmly believe that respect for legal protection and the rule of law are essential in order to provide businesses and investors with the certainty that Panama is a safe country to invest in,” it said. The company operates the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, under a concession contract approved in 1997 and renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. Panama’s comptroller authority in April said that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of the concession. But the company denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama President José Raúl Mulino said during his weekly news conference on Thursday that he fully supported the comptroller’s case and would await the court’s verdict. “We have all seen what that contract has costed the Panamanian nation over time,” Mulino said without elaborating. He alluded to some sort of public-private partnership for the ports, saying there was a lot of interest from private companies, but that it was in the early stages and provided no details. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan, announced in March, to sell its port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes the U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., also got caught up in tensions between Beijing and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the canal, initially welcomed that plan. However, it apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty, Hutchison said on Monday that it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, which also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. Panama Ports Company said Friday it would communicate with the Panamanian government “at the appropriate time,” affirming that it believes engaging with the government “is vital to discuss the way forward for” the company. Panama's government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press journalist Alma Solís in Panama City contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: US Treasuries Soar As Slower Job Growth Boosts Fed Rate-Cut Bets

Treasuries rallied, with short-term yields posting their biggest drop in a year, after softer US jobs data prompted traders to boost bets that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates as soon as next month. Yields on two-year notes tumbled 21 basis points to 3.74%, setting up the biggest drop since last August. Traders fully priced in two rate cuts this year, with an 80% chance of a reduction in September. The move weighed on the dollar and stocks, sending an index of the greenback’s strength down as much as 1% and the S&P 500 nearly 2% lower. The yield moves reflected a dramatic shift in sentiment around the monetary policy outlook, shaped in part by President Donald Trump’s relentless pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates despite elevated inflation expectations. “We would look for the Fed to begin lowering rates in September,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “It’s somewhat amazing how you can have a sitting Fed Chair intimate the strength in labor one day and receive these numbers a few days later.” Expectations for rate cuts collapsed on Wednesday after Powell’s latest comments on the outlook, less than an hour after Trump said it was his understanding the Fed would cut in September. Friday’s rebound — a seeming validation of Trump’s view and those of two Fed governors he appointed, who dissented from the July 30 decision not to cut rates — may prove historic. The moves were sparked by a report on US labor that showed payrolls increased 73,000 in July. Figures for the prior two months were revised down by nearly 260,000. The jobless rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%. While the pace of hiring has been slowing since April, Powell said low unemployment indicated the jobs market was “in balance” when explaining why policymakers remain on the sidelines. On Friday, Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman expressed concerns that policymakers’ hesitance to lower rates could risk damaging the labor market. The two policymakers voted against the Fed’s decision this week, opting for a quarter-point reduction. The jobs report suggests Waller’s camp “may hold sway or convince more people to come on his side of the argument. And maybe they missed the opportunity in July but it raises the odds you get it in September,” said Jeffrey Rosenberg, portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “That is why you are seeing the big move on the front end of the curve.” Friday’s rally reversed Treasuries’ 0.4% loss last month, only the second monthly decline this year. The market is still up 3.4% for the year. “It’s a big beautiful bond market,” said Michael Collins, portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said on Bloomberg Television. He prefers the two- to 10-year part of the curve where “you don’t have to take a lot of interest-rate risk to get a lot of benefit.” The magnitude of the shift Friday was reflected in high trading volumes in Treasury futures. Some of that activity involved scrapping wagers on shrinking gaps between short- and long-term Treasury yields, which became losers in the rally unleashed by the jobs data, in which those gaps widened as two- to five-year yields saw the biggest declines.

Title: As Tariffs Bite and Jobs Stall, New Interactive Tool Tracks How Much Trump and GOP Are Raising the Cost of Living

Yves here. The lead stories in the press are about Trump’s August 1 tariff salvo, but it’s a little too soon for much in the way of analysis, as opposed to reaction. These tariffs are sure to increase inflation in the US even if some companies accept reductions in their lofty profit levels (corporate profits have been at a sky-high percentage of GDP for years). So we’ll turn to a new tool for estimating increases in living costs after a couple of hot takes on what Trump has wrought. Just after the Trump tariff announcements, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report, and it was a doozy. Not only was the headline number, a mere 73,000 new jobs markedly lower than expectations, and an increase in unemployment to 4.2%, which is not all that bad. But when you look under the hood, it’s much worse. From Bloomberg: Rosenberg of BlackRock says the revisions show a “dramatically different picture” now when you look at the past three months. Before these numbers, the three-month average for payroll gains was 150,000. With the revisions for May and June and the new July figure, the three-month average is now 35,000. That’s entirely different. Oh, and the reason for the big initial overstatement and then the revisions? The so-called birth-death models, which estimates employment growth resulting from new business creation. Those who were following the econoblogosphere in the runup to the financial crisis will recall Barry Ritholtz, Michael Shelock, and then-luminaries who are no longer posting regularly assailing the birth-death model results to be greatly exaggerated, among other reasons due to big falls in construction, and on a scale to distort the overall results. And even before the jobs data hit the wires, some economists were stressing that the tariff increases would hurt demand. From a different Bloomberg account: But at an average of 15%, the world is still facing some of the steepest US tariffs since the 1930s, roughly six times higher than they were a year ago. Trump’s latest volley outlined minimum 10% baseline levies, with rates of 15% or more for countries with trade surpluses with the US. So far, the global economy has held up better than many economists expected after Trump’s initial tariff blitz. A rush to beat the elevated rates spurred a front-loading of exports, aiding many Asian economies and shielding US consumers from price spikes. That could all be about to change. “For the rest of the world, this is a serious demand shock,” Raghuram Rajan, former India central bank governor and chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. “You will see a lot of central banks contemplating cutting as the rest of the world slows somewhat in the face of these tariffs.” In other words, in the US, the tariffs will increase stagflationary pressures. That view is confirmed by a report at CNBC: The latest U.S. tariff policy is “still not the end of the story,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Friday. “President Trump’s latest flurry of tariffs implies that the US effective tariff rate will rise to about 18%, from 2.3% last year,” he noted. That’s higher than expected and carries downside risks for global economic growth projections, as well as some upside risk for U.S. inflation forecasts, Brown said.

Dáte (@svdate) July 31, 2025 Note that Trump’s tariff use of emergency powers to impose tariffs is facing a series of court challenges. Most experts expect Trump to lose. If that happens, it would not only wonderfully discredit Trump but also require a costly refunding of the tariffs collected. With Jerome Powell having sat pat on interest rates, after Trump screamed for a cut, Trump will further increase pressure for the Fed chair’s ouster, which will only increase investor upset. But the odds are not trivial that Powell’s concern, of tariff-induced price increases, will be borne out in the next month or two. And as we have repeatedly pointed out, while a central bank’s interest rate increases can choke economic activity, it does not follow that putting money on sale provides a boost. Most businesses decide to expand operations based on conditions in their market, as in demand and competitor activities. The only enterprises where cheap money in and of itself might lead to incumbents to increase their activities are ones where the cost of money is one of their biggest expenses. Those are mainly financial institutions and financial speculators like real estate developers and hedgies. Common Dreams has publicized a new way to get a better approximation of the real cost of Trump tariffs and other policy measures on household budgets, I hope some of you will road test it, and if is seems useful, encourage people you know, particularly in the press, in politics, or active in social media, to add it to their toolbox. By Julia Conley, staff writer at Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams Six months into U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term, an economic justice group on Thursday unveiled an interactive tool to help Americans put a number on the unmistakable feeling many have reported having about the Republican leader who promised to “make America affordable again”: that costs have in fact gone up under Trump, and that the White House and the GOP are to blame. Using the tool introduced by Unrig Our Economy, people across the U.S. can see exactly how much the price of essentials has gone up in their state, with the advocacy group connecting the dots between the rising cost of living and Trump’s tariffs as well as corporate tax breaks Republicans have relentlessly pushed to pass. According to the “Don’t Inflate Our Plates” tool, the price of beef in Texas has gone up nearly 47% since the early days of Trump’s second term, while eggs cost $3.19 more than they did before Trump took office. In California, eggs now cost over $5.00 more than they did before Trump’s second term, based on “historical trends, real-time supplier data, and market analysis” that Unrig Our Economy examined. Trump & congressional Republicans claim that food prices will come down. While they raise prices – we pay. 🚨So we built a brand-new site to hold them accountable:https://t.co/h3lVqz2Z6A tracks food prices in real time — and exposes how the GOP's policies are raising costs. pic.twitter.com/YKvzMV683Z — Unrig Our Economy (@UnrigOurEconomy) July 31, 2025 Unrig Our Economy gained some of its data from Kroger’s pricing data, finding that in states with Kroger stores, the price of beef has gone up between 16% and 72%, with the biggest price hikes in Alaska and Utah. Egg prices in particular were a talking point for Trump during his presidential campaign, but they’ve risen in many states where Kroger operates, with customers in Michigan—where the president won in 2024—paying 58% more for eggs. “Trump and Republicans in Congress are singlehandedly inflating the cost of everyday items that Americans rely on,” said Leor Tal, campaign director for Unrig Our Economy. “While billionaires and corporations cash in on Republican-backed tax breaks, working-class families are left paying higher prices for eggs, coffee, and more.” Unrig Our Economy pointed to reporting on Trump’s tariffs, more of which are set to be announced Friday, with the president expected to impose rates up to 50% on some imports. As Common Dreams reported this week, the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative found that just as corporate executives used labor shortages and supply chain disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic as cover to keep prices high even after those problems were resolved, many are now using tariffs as a justification for price increases. “We certainly welcome a reduction in the Chinese tariffs, but we’ll be announcing a price increase here regardless of any changes of the Chinese tariffs over the next week or two to go into effect in June,” the CEO of one footwear brand said in a recent earnings call. Unrig Our Economy pointed to recent polling that showed Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s tariffs, including 47% of Republican voters. The Trump administration has also made a number of regulatory moves benefiting corporations that aim to take as much money from working families’ household budgets as possible, including a push for the cancellation of a Biden-era Federal Trade Commission rule allowing consumers to easily cancel subscriptions; the FTC’s decision to drop a lawsuit challenging price discrimination by PepsiCo; and the commission’s move shutting down public comments on corporate pricing tactics. The interactive tool was unveiled weeks after the president signed into law his sweeping domestic policy and budget package, which includes the largest cuts to public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in history, increases monthly payments for student loan borrowers under repayment assistance plans, and hands out $117 billion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans while providing just $77 billion in cumulative savings to the bottom 60% of earners. As Unrig Our Economy unveiled its tool allowing Americans to see exactly how their household budgets are being impacted under the Trump administration, the Century Foundation (TCF) and Morning Consult released the results of a poll in which they asked more than 2,000 people in June how they were being affected by the high cost of living over the past six months. More than half of respondents said “billionaires, corporations, and congressional Republicans have made their lives harder,” and 60% said the Trump administration is to blame for the higher cost of living. More than 4 in 5 Americans said they were concerned about the price of groceries, and nearly half were concerned about their ability to pay their rent or mortgage. Forty-eight percent said they would have difficulty paying an unexpected $500 bill, like a home repair or medical bill, without borrowing or using credit, and nearly 20% said it would be “very difficult” to make the payment. Even among households with incomes over $100,000, more than a third said they would have a hard time meeting the surprise expense without dipping into savings or using credit cards—suggesting that these households are using a large proportion of their relatively comfortable monthly income for essentials “While the federal government tears down programs such as Medicaid and food assistance and federal regulators give the green light to companies to rip off consumers, families are being forced to construct their own safety nets from a web of risky financial practices,” said TCF. Unrig the Economy said that with Don’t Inflate Our Plates, the group is calling out “the Republican-backed policies that got us here” and demanding “that Congress put working people first.” Saw an article in the last couple of days warning that Social Security Staffing cuts might threaten Cost-of-Living Adjustments- no one there to analyze infaltion. Someone commented that there was plenty of data available everywhere. This looks interesting. Bill Maher, the Nobel Prize winning economist, declared he was wrong about the inflationary effects of Trump’s tariffs. The effort and study into Maher’s advanced degrees must have displaced the simple Econ 101 exhortations about lagging effects of policies on the real economy. A small additional point for Mr. Maher: the economy is NOT the Stock Market and the three major Indices reported breathlessly every night on Broadcast news. I’m sorry but Common Dreams is mostly apology for the D faction – it’s all the bad ol’ Rs. They are proponents of the Bipartisan status quo. The D faction has done nothing but vote for kleptocracy, anti-labor, pro-finance, genocide, war and everyone turns a blind eye to the rampant institutional corruption in both the so-called public and private sectors. “… More than half of respondents said “billionaires, corporations, and congressional Republicans have made their lives harder,” and 60% said the Trump administration is to blame for the higher cost of living…” So whaddya gonna do? Vote D? Arrghh The same old garbage for decades got us where we are now. The US is an oligarchy, let’s stop pretending otherwise, the charades have become tiresome and irritating. The judicial branch make a mockery of the law and the constitution, the legislative branch are openly and legally bribed, and the Idiot Emperor and the Kakistocrat Krew are accelerating the rot. Also, when are folks going to see that the Emperor has lost his marbles? Dude is showing signs of physical and mental decline. Even the so-called liberal outlets don’t see it. I guess late-stage empire produces deep corruption, kleptocracy, corruption, kakistocracy and war. Don’t need to say “so-called liberal” as liberal is an enforcer of the status quo as well as being Far-right wing. This is ad hominem and a violation of our site Policies. You don’t disprove the validity of the remark. And inequality and immiseration of the poor is increasing enormously under Trump. No, it was an attack on the credibility of Common Dreams. As in, if the witness is unreliable, that is grounds to doubt the testimony. Ad hominem is an attack on the messenger unrelated to the message. Credibility, however, is always relevant. Jeez Louise, you fail as a pedant. No, ad hominem is not about testimony. It is the logical fallacy of trying to dispute the validity of an argument by attacking the party that said it. You might try using the modern invention of a search engine rather than tout your erroneous beliefs. Ad hominem (Latin for ‘to the person’), short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than the substance of the argument itself. This avoids genuine debate by creating a diversion often using a totally irrelevant, but often highly charged attribute of the opponent’s character or background. The most common form of this fallacy is “A” makes a claim of “fact”, to which “B” asserts that “A” has a personal trait, quality or physical attribute that is repugnant thereby going off-topic, and hence “B” concludes that “A” has their “fact” wrong – without ever addressing the point of the debate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem Your comment about credibility is also false. Even parties with erratic track records can make accurate observations. That is why you must address the argument on its merits. That’s right. The Democratic Party knows that all it has to do to regain power is wait for Trump to self-destruct. They have no intention of creating plans that would improve the lives of ordinary people. JonnyJames is also wrong in his depiction of Common Dreams. They are Sandernistas. They have often criticized Team D from the soft left. I did apologize in advance, and apologize for sounding offensive.I take your point, and I do admit that I am angry about the political situation in general. We can quibble about Common Dreams, they do post some good material, however I am overly sensitive about Rs this, Ds that at this point. It all seems so superficial and lost in the forest for the trees. My observations are not necessarily ad hom polemics, given the context. I did engage in ad hom in “the Idiot Emperor and the Kakistocrat Krew”. But I have heard many analysts we all follow say very similar things. I have read CD for years, and I feel that they have done the old bait and switch routine every election. It is not ad hom to say that. The old, “hold your nose and vote D” the lesser evil and all that. From what I have read here over the years, we all agree on the main point: partisan politics is a dead-end. The US has no functioning democracy and can be seen as an oligarchy. 1. Common Dreams very often posts about the US as an oligarchy but (like pretty much everyone) they have no or unrealistic ideas. So I don’t agree with your characterization 2. Common Dreams did not endorse Harris, which for a reader-supported venue generally aligned with the Sandernista left was pretty bold. They still said Trump was awful and dissed voting third party, but throwing cold water on Kamala would at the margin lead more readers to vote for Stein or another third party candidate. See: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/we-can-t-endorse-harris-but-we-oppose-trump-and-voting-third-party-is-a-mistake I know am being unrealistic in my expectations, but the implicit assumption is if you don’t vote 3rd party, then one must “vote” for the D (or R) candidate. (in our FPTP electoral system) So although they did not explicitly endorse Harris, they did not endorse an alternative candidate, thus the endorsement was by default. The way electoral issues are framed are a bit disappointing to me, but that’s just me. Also, on foreign affairs, I have been disappointed with stuff like this https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/putin-russia-gas-ukraine-war https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/trump-vance-putin https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/02/20/vladimir-putin-authentic-leader-republican-party No, they were endorsing not voting at all. Or not voting for a Presidential candidate but voting down ticket. That is where their logic goes. They might not have been able to admit that to themselves. Thank you for hearing me out, I should have articulated the fine points in my earlier post. I mean…the writeup by Yves and some of the linked articles, including Common Dreams pointed to multiple examples of things that the Biden administration did to help consumers but which were – or are in the process of being – intentionally overturned by the Trump administration. For example the CPFB and the “click to cancel” thing. While we on the left may have a lot of legitimate long term beef with the trajectory of the Democratic Party, as far as average American “consumers”, the GOP and in particular Trump are demonstrably worse. ‘Republicans against Trump @RpsAgainstTrump Brazil is the largest exporter of coffee to the U.S. With Trump’s 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, your coffee is about to get a lot more expensive. (Prices have already jumped over 15% in recent months.) All because he wants to protect his corrupt friend Bolsonaro. Insane.’ The whole thing is asinine but I wonder if Washington will privately agree to look the other way if, for example, Brazilian coffee was shipped to say Mexico who then sold it to the US for a marked up price. If there was a mini-revolt over the price of coffee, the Trump regime might think it wise to go this way to take some off the pressure form these price increases. And this could happen for other goods as well. Trouble is his admin is shot through with ideologues who might rebel at the idea. “If there was a mini-revolt over the price of coffee…” As one NC commenter recently stated, “Coffee is not a matter of life or death, it’s much more important than that.” Also see Michael Pollan on caffeine and capitalism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHW7Ly8k0X8&t=7s Might one then infer that a lack of caffeine will bring about socialism, inefficiencies due to acquiescent lassitude, something else entirely? Does the price of eggs have anything to do with tariffs, or just with bird flu and the culling of birds? I’ve no doubt the tariffs will have significant impact, but the eggs are one of the only concrete [ie non-political] statistics in the linked article. TOM: A google search found the USA is importing eggs from Turkey and South Korea. Other sources being considered include Europe and Brazil. It is difficult to imagine large eggs being more than $5 doz anywhere in the USA, but well, California is “special”. Before Covid they were 49¢ per doz here. But for a few weeks now (in Wisconsin) they have been holding at $2.71 at Aldi (and I think that is high). Here on Cape Cod, they are $6.99 and up a dozen. Massachusetts has cage free laws. organic pasture raised go for around 10 bucks a dozen here in California. My ladies make them for chicken feed (and whatever bugs they scrounge). Where are policy proposals that stand a chance of enactment to reverse the rise in interest costs? What will those mean to you, me and our friends, neighbors and everybody? After absorbing increase in premiums on auto insurance and housing insurance, I’m waiting patiently on the retrospective analysis of what Did Happen the last four years between mid year 2021 to January 2025. This isn’t what about the other side necessarily but clowns like a Krugman or Noah Smith were crowing loud and proud on the wonders by those Biden administration economic policies. Mainstream economists deserve their scorn and this cheerleading is readily available to find from previous years. My last six month auto premium finally flattened out, or unchanged. Year to date the average price on a gallon of gas is practically unchanged as well. Feel welcome to highlight items that have increased or will be increasing in that basket of theoretical groceries for a family of four. But personally my personal cost of living increased by roughly 25% to 35% during that aforementioned time frame until early 2025. The cost of natural gas from PG&E went up about 40 percent in the last year. Locally grown organic eggs are still around $10 per dozen. That’s down from $12 from a few months ago. Our auto insurance premium actually went down a whopping $1.66 per month. Alas, our business work van with tools of the trade was recently stolen, so if Farmer’s runs true to form they’ll get back their buck sixty-six and a whole lot more come renewal time. Trade van thefts are rampant here no doubt due to harder economic times, and our town seems able to afford only 1 police officer per 10,000 residents, which is 1/3 the national average. Good times! Forgot to add, our city’s parsimony when it comes to citizen security services is rather baffling in that we are hardly a community of poors, over the last few years under state pressure we’ve added thousands of new residential units, and our state and local taxes are some of the highest in the nation. PG&E, aren’t they a notorious and poorly run energy utilities company on the west coast I wish to suggest? I don’t do organic anything to be honest, so the best of my egg purchases in a convenient dozen currently run about $3 per dozen for a store branded carton. My personal experience is just that, of course within my daily or monthly consumption patterns. A simple anecdote from a supposedly “Simple Man!” We went from high times under Biden and just now people ( not specifically to you or anyone here ) recognize the cost of living increased dramatically since 2021….oh come on. Would a Harris administration really have made marked improvements or changes in a few short months? I think, in that hypothetical , most media would’ve extended a grace period but that is just me being a cynical American citizen. I had 3 Bidenomics sightings yesterday, people walking on the road in this rural area where if you’re doing that, you’re in a bad way. What looked like a couple and two individuals. I got lucky with auto insurance this go around, the price went down slight; and I negotiated a better deal with Spectrum, to my shock, sans TV bundle. Just Internet-only now, and for about $16 less per month. I was shocked. Things were deteriorating even prior to our surprise jobs number today. I’m an owner of a thirty year old wholesale specialty food and spice business. We import and then manufacture, package items you cannot get onshore, or often times, spices etc that literally cannot be grown here. Yet these inputs are being tariffed seemingly with zero thought, foresight, planning. It’s the whim of the king and whether someone was mean to his bestie decision making. But small businesses like mine have very little runway to get through this environment. Everyone I know is getting more convinced (perhaps a bit of wish casting) that the courts will strike down the tariffs. They have already lost in US Trade Court by unanimous decision. The US Appeals Court yesterday seemed very skeptical of the governments position. I expect the decision to be the same as the Trade Court. SCOTUS? Not so sure. And how long must we wait? Or if the decision ultimately doesn’t go his way, will he even abide by it? In the meantime the admin is blowing up businesses, jobs, inflation. I see it up close everyday. “Yet these inputs are being tariffed seemingly with zero thought, foresight, planning.” You’re dead wrong: it’s a great big beautiful plan and you and I ain’t in it. Hey, us not being in, IS the plan. Saw a published US unemployment stat for the last quarter that youth unemployment had risen from 9.2% to 10%, which qualifies the headline rate. Trump didn’t like todays jobs report so he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer. https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-orders-firing-bls-commissioner-weak-jobs-report-rcna222531 I struggle to visualize what is the outcome Trump and his cronies expect from this. Tariffs are only a good threat so long as the US market is good; now, 342 million people is nothing to scoff at, but as immiseration sets apace and companies are forced to diversify buyers (after all, the only reliable expectations scenario for Trump is that he does things on a dime and can cause ruinous losses based on whims) how relevant will the US market keep on being? Furthermore, in a pure balance-of-payments matter, the US dollar as the global means of payment, store of value, etc. necessitates US deficits, as is well known. The attempt (meagre as it may be) to induce surpluses would imply catastrophic deflation, as too few dollars are available for world investment/commerce needs, and the obvious impossibility to industrialize (I don’t expect Trump and his ilk to follow the Credit Theory of Money, though). On the other hand, the deflationary pressures could well make everyone who is holding treasuries and the like to cash out in order to benefit from the currency arbitrage, causing raising yields, an incapability to refinance the US debts, and stock and commodity prices to soar (since the dollars would have to be put somewhere that isn’t more US treasuries). Any way out of this dilemma that I can see is to cause either inflationary ruin or bankruptcy (and maybe both). Is there anyone thinking of the consequences? A large cause of all that US currency floating around in the world is due to the country’s five-decades of consecutive trade deficits where it has paid for imports with US cash/debt. When the US had a trade surplus, other countries would want to borrow US money in order to buy American production. If the US was competitive in international trade, other countries would buy US goods with the dollars they are holding reducing the amount of US money floating around out there. Increased manufacturing in the US would also mean faster economic growth, more jobs and more tax revenue – this would reduce the rather huge 6-8% of GDP federal budget deficits that the country is experiencing. Well, it looks a bit vaporwareish at this point. I can go to the linked website and compare the price of beef at Kroger’s for different states, which I guess is something. Also, I’m sorry if this is also ad hominem, (at least not a direct criticism) but hello! 1997 would like their web designer back . . . I suspect that people are underestimating the economic cliff dead ahead due to the front-loading of US imports (to avoid tariffs). The front-loading both delayed and will soon enhance the effects of the tariffs on PRICES and REAL ACTIVITY and TRADE. Now that 18% average US tariffs are permanent, US imports will not only decrease in an amount consistent with an increase in the average tariff from 2.3% to 18%, US imports will also decrease an even larger amount to make up for the excess inventories that were previously imported to front run the increased tariffs. This sudden tremendous decrease in US imports will sharply decrease global real activity in the second half of 2025. Similarly US businesses will go from having abundant low-cost front-loaded inventories to suddenly having scarce high-cost inventories. Prices will increase dramatically and rapidly in the US in the second half, even as global GDP plummets. Data point: 3-4 months ago I paid $13.99 for a 2.5 pound bag of Costco’s French roast whole coffee beans. The following month it was $116.99, and ten days ago I paid $19.99. Regardless of the beans’ origin that is a coffee Brazilian. I’m assuming you mean $16.99 not $169.99. I just read this article right before your comment, coincidentally: https://www.barchart.com/story/news/33822282/coffee-prices-plunge-as-supply-concerns-ease I don’t see how the price action downwards makes sense on the tariff exemption news? It was caused by a lack of supply due to environmental factors. A reduction in tariffs would only increase US consumption of it. Ive been talking to a lot of coffee roasters recently and one mentioned that Robusta will likely come back into favour as Arabica becomes harder to grow due to climate change. He mentioned that Arabica became the popular bean partly because it was seen as a “premium” bean in the first place. Anecdotally, my friend recently brought back some Robusta from Vietnam and it had amazing flavour. I feel like it’s underrated, at least here in Canada. Oops! You are correct. It was $16.99. In Trump’s defense, he is working to improve the economic numbers: Trump fires Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after disappointing job numbershttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fires-commissioner-of-labor-statistics-july-jobs-report-erika-mcentarfer/ Eggs were about $12 last fall at my local Costco last fall. Last I checked in the Spring of this year they were $8.99. I’ll take a look again but I don’t think they are up $5 since Trump took office. Your email address will not be published.

BlackRock's ETHA commands Ethereum ETF inflow surge, capturing 78% of total investments. Spot Ethereum ETFs had their 20th straight day of net inflows as of July 31, the longest streak of positive flows since their debut. According to data from SoSoValue, these funds attracted a combined $17 million in net inflows on the day. This sustained momentum has pushed total inflows across the nine spot ETH ETFs to nearly $5.4 billion, significantly higher than the cumulative flows seen in previous months. In fact, this month’s inflows are approximately three times greater than the second-highest month since launch. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF, ETHA, led the charge with $4.2 billion in monthly inflows, accounting for 78% of all capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the pace of growth, calling it “wild.” He noted that if Bitcoin ETFs didn’t exist, ETHA would be the fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion in assets, beating previous records by nearly 2x. These consistent gains have significantly boosted the total net assets under management. The spot Ethereum ETFs now hold $21.52 billion in net assets, representing 5% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Why ethereum is suddenly beating bitcoin
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ethereum-vs-bitcoin-eth-btc-price-crypto-rally-spot-etfs-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-08-01T09:30:02Z
Full Content:
The world's most popular cryptocurrency is being outdone by its closest competitor in the last few weeks. Bitcoin has rallied to record highs this year, but its more recent performance has lagged behind ethereum. Ethereum's price is up 54% over the last month, compared to bitcoin's 10% increase. Zack Shapiro, an attorney at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told BI there were a handful of reasons ethereum has pulled ahead. "I think a lot of it is that it's a speculation trade," he said of ethereum's latest rally. "Long term, we have to see." Here are some of the things Shapiro thinks are driving the fervor for ethereum. Markets are enthusiastic about stablecoins after the passing of the GENIUS Act, the Senate's landmark bill that sets the terms surrounding stablecoin regulation and opens the door for more issuers to mint their own fiat-backed tokens. Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD, and other top stablecoins on the crypto market are issued on the Ethereum network. "People think that stablecoins might proliferate a lot more. Maybe some of those stablecoins will be on ethereum," Shapiro said of the market's psychology. Retail giants like Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, and using the tokens for retail payments would be a "big breakthrough" for the market, according to Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk. Shapiro says institutional investors have also recently offered ethereum ETFs, another factor driving inflows into the token. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the firms that now offer a spot ethereum ETF. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF is up 48.9% over the last month. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund is up 33.1%, while Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust ETF is up 49.2% over that time frame. Cumulative spot ethereum ETF volumes rose to $123.5 billion as of Wednesday, according to data compiled by The Block. Corporate crypto treasuries have also proliferated in 2025, and recently, many have been scooping up ethereum. Bitmine Immersion, one such crypto treasury, said last week it raised its ethereum holdings to over $2 billion. The Ether Machine, another crypto treasury firm, said on Wednesday that its total ethereum holdings had climbed to $56.9 million. "Those vehicles are out there buying ethereum. And so that could also be additional buy-pressure that's moving up the price," Shapiro said. Shapiro isn't certain that the momentum will last for ethereum. He believes much of the hype for the coin in recent weeks has to do with excitement and uncertainty over ethereum's potential catalysts. The crypto's rally could lose steam once more regulatory details are solidified, he said. He pointed in particular to the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill that's awaiting approval in Congress. "Is the market structure bill going to pass? Are these sort of crypto primitives going to find product market fit in the market? And then is Ethereum, as opposed to other blockchain systems, going to be the winner from that?" Shapiro said. "I would personally probably sell the news." Check out Business Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges Check out Business Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges Jump to
