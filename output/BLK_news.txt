PROPERTY PRICES CLIMBED by 8.1% in the 12 months to January this year, according to figures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). In January, property prices rose for the 17th month in a row, leaving the average cost significantly higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. The CSO’s latest property price index shows that the median price of a home sold in Ireland was €359,999 in the last year. Prices in Dublin rose by 7.5%, while prices outside Dublin were up by 8.6% compared with January 2024. The highest median price for a property was €662,349 in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €180,000 in Leitrim.

Clones, Co Monaghan, had the least expensive price of €133,000. Advertisement The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the north and north-west (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 12.7%, while at the other end of the scale, the mid-east (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.8% rise. House prices rose by 8.5%, while apartment prices climbed by 5.8%. The continued property price increases were announced just one day after the Central Bank’s latest forecasts show it estimates the Government will miss its housing targets over the next three years. This year, the Central Bank estimated that 35,000 homes will be built – 6,000 less than the revised government targets. Rachel McGovern, Deputy Chief Executive at Brokers Ireland, said this is exacerbating the home ownership desires of huge swathes of the population. “The Central Bank’s report yesterday is just the latest in a string of reports pointing to the loss of momentum in the housing market,” she said. McGovern added that there needs to be “a shake-up” in the State’s response to housing. “We need to hear less about targets and more about solid initiatives to change policy, such as the new Strategic Housing & Infrastructure Delivery Office promised in the Programme for Government 2025,” McGovern said. “We need to hear what is being done to speed up housing infrastructure such as water services and land re-zoning.” She said the Government needs to be “brave and decisive” and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission.

Title: Insuring Coastal and Ocean Resilience

Protecting high-risk coastal communities from the worst effects of climate change requires increased investment in critical adaptation and mitigation projects. With innovative tools like parametric policies, the insurance industry is uniquely positioned to drive long-term climate resilience. LONDON – Climate change poses a growing threat to coastal and marine ecosystems, whose resilience is vital for global stability, economic prosperity, and the survival of all life on Earth. While urgent action is necessary to protect these ecosystems, many coastal communities lack the financial resources needed to recover from climate-related disasters like hurricanes, typhoons, and storm surges. Closing the financing gap is critical to mitigating the worst effects of climate change – and the insurance industry can be a powerful driver of positive change, leveraging risk-management solutions to strengthen long-term coastal and ocean resilience. Hurricane Beryl, which tore through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico last July, underscored the need for targeted insurance solutions in climate-vulnerable regions, as the storm damaged or destroyed nearly 90% of Barbados’s fishing fleet. With no income and little to no insurance coverage, many fishers and their communities were left without the means to rebuild. Despite the heightened risks, insurers recognize that well-designed products, accurate risk pricing, and strengthened resilience measures can make climate-vulnerable markets financially viable. In many cases, partnerships with governments and development organizations to share risk and address protection gaps further encourages insurers to stay in the market. By remaining in these regions, insurers not only preserve an important market segment but also help build more resilient coastal communities. Parametric insurance policies offer one such promising solution. These policies are designed to serve as a financial safety net for individuals, small businesses, and even countries following environmental disasters, ensuring rapid payouts that help communities and governments recover faster. Equally important, parametric policies play a key role in risk mitigation, enabling governments and businesses to invest in long-term resilience strategies. A notable example of a country-level solution is the British-American insurer WTW’s parametric insurance policy for Belize, designed to support the country’s ability to service its blue-bond debt. This innovative financial mechanism automatically releases funds when predefined environmental events occur, ensuring that Belize can meet its debt obligations and achieve its climate-resilience goals even after natural disasters.

Subscribe Now Beyond risk transfer, insurance can be instrumental in mobilizing private capital for resilience-building projects. Long-term institutional investors, including insurers, hold vast capital reserves that can be directed toward sustainable infrastructure. But unlocking these funds remains a challenge, particularly for large-scale projects in developing countries and high-risk regions. The Infrastructure Resilience Development Fund, a joint initiative of the Insurance Development Forum (IDF) and BlackRock, seeks to tackle this challenge by mobilizing insurance-sector capital for investments in resilient infrastructure in developing and emerging economies. The Fund supports greenfield and brownfield commercial projects in sectors such as renewable energy, water, waste management, transportation, and telecommunications. By certifying that projects meet insurers’ credit and risk requirements, it offers a channel for much-needed financing of infrastructure in these countries, including investments in nature-based solutions, particularly in coastal communities, thereby promoting long-term sustainability. Another example is Nautilus, the Blue Guarantee Company, a joint initiative of the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA) and the Development Guarantee Group, supported by the UK government. Nautilus uses guarantees – essentially investment insurance – to unlock private capital at scale for coastal and ocean resilience projects. By offering a “promise to pay” structure that reduces default risks for investors, Nautilus aims to leverage its capital base to back sustainable blue economy ventures, ranging from small- and medium-size enterprises to large-scale infrastructure projects. Such a strategy could mitigate perceived risks and enhance investor confidence, attracting private financing to climate-resilient and regenerative ocean initiatives around the world. To close the sustainable blue economy protection gap, we must also foster partnerships among insurance companies, investors, and policymakers to harness the expertise and resources of the public and private sectors. These public-private partnerships would share a single goal: facilitating innovative adaptation and risk-management solutions that benefit vulnerable communities. IDF members’ work with ORRAA is a prime example of leveraging public, private, and philanthropic resources to scale up investments in nature-based solutions like coral-reef protection and mangrove restoration. Sovereign risk pools, which enable island states to band together and access affordable insurance coverage, are another useful model for greater financial resilience in the face of climate-related disasters. The upcoming Blue Economy and Finance Forum and the United Nations Ocean Conference, which will be held in Monaco and Nice in June, underscore the insurance sector’s growing role in building ocean resilience. But achieving meaningful progress requires a multifaceted strategy for expanding access to insurance solutions like parametric coverage. To make coverage more accessible and tailored to local realities, we must invest in data and risk modeling, thereby improving our understanding, assessment, and pricing of ocean-related threats. ORRAA and AXA’s Coastal Risk Index demonstrates how a data-driven approach can drastically improve climate resilience. Perhaps most importantly, given the unprecedented scale of the climate challenge, closing the protection gap demands a holistic approach that integrates industry risk-management capabilities, innovative financial instruments, and strategic capital deployment. The widespread adoption of nature-based insurance products will not only mitigate physical risks but also support biodiversity and ecosystem health. By strengthening natural coastal defenses, we can unlock the full economic and ecological potential of a resilient ocean and create a thriving blue economy.

ЛОНДОН – Изменение климата ставит под угрозу прибрежные и морские экосистемы, от устойчивости которых зависит глобальная стабильность, экономическое процветание и выживание всего живого на Земле. Нужно срочно защитить эти экосистемы, но у многих жителей прибрежных районов нет финансовых ресурсов даже на восстановление после климатических бедствий – ураганов, тайфунов и штормовых приливов. Критически важно устранить этот недостаток, чтобы смягчить худшие последствия изменения климата. Мощным фактором позитивных изменений может стать страховая отрасль, повышая с помощью методов риск-менеджмента долгосрочную климатическую устойчивость прибрежных районов и океанов. После урагана «Берил», обрушившегося на Карибский бассейн и Мексиканский залив в июле прошлого года, стала очевидна необходимость целевых страховых решений в климатически уязвимых районах. Ураган повредил или уничтожил почти 90% всего рыболовного флота Барбадоса. Лишившись доходов и не имея достаточного страхового покрытия, многие рыбаки и их семьи остались без средств на восстановление. Несмотря на возросшие риски, страховщики признают, что с хорошо продуманными продуктами, точной оценкой рисков и мерами повышения устойчивости можно сделать климатически уязвимые рынки финансово привлекательными. Во многих случаях партнёрства с госсектором и организациями развития, помогающие разделить риски и повысить уровень защиты, дополнительно стимулируют страховщиков оставаться на рынке. Тем самым страховщики не только сохраняют важный сегмент рынка, но и способствуют устойчивости в прибрежных районах. Одно из перспективных решений – полисы параметрического страхования. Эти полисы играют роль финансовой защиты для частных лиц, малого бизнеса и даже стран после природных катастроф, гарантируя мгновенные выплаты, которые помогают населению и правительствам быстро восстановиться. Не менее важно то, что параметрические полисы играют ключевую роль в смягчении рисков, поскольку позволяют правительствам и бизнесу инвестировать в долгосрочные стратегии устойчивости. Ярким примером такого решения на государственном уровне стал полис параметрического страхования для Белиза британско-американской страховой компании WTW. Он призван обеспечить обслуживание страной долга по «синим облигациям». Этот инновационный финансовый механизм автоматически выдаёт средства в случае наступления заранее оговорённых природных событий, что гарантирует выполнение Белизом долговых обязательств и достижение поставленных целей климатической устойчивости даже после природных катастроф.

Subscribe Now Помимо снижения рисков, страхование может сыграть важную роль в привлечении частного капитала в проекты, повышающие климатическую устойчивость. Долгосрочные институциональные инвесторы, включая страховщиков, обладают огромными капиталами, которые можно направить на создание устойчивой инфраструктуры. Однако до сих пор очень трудно привлекать эти средства, особенно в масштабные проекты в развивающихся странах и регионах с высокими рисками. Фонд развития устойчивой инфраструктуры (IRDF) – совместная инициатива Форума развития страхования (IDF) и компании BlackRock – пытается решить эту проблему, привлекая капиталы страховой отрасли для инвестиций в устойчивую инфраструктуру в развивающихся странах. Фонд поддерживает коммерческие проекты (предполагающие строительство с нуля или перестройку существующих объектов) в таких отраслях, как возобновляемая энергетика, водоснабжение, управление отходами, транспорт, телекоммуникации. Подтверждая соответствие проектов страховым требованиям, связанным с кредитоспособностью и рисками, фонд открывает канал столь необходимого финансирования инфраструктуры в этих странах (включая инвестиции в природные решения), особенно в прибрежных районах, что способствует повышению долгосрочной климатической устойчивости. Другой пример – «Компания синих гарантий Nautilus». Это совместная инициатива Альянса за повышение устойчивости и снижение рисков океана (ORRAA) и Группы гарантий развития (DGG); её поддержало правительство Британии. Nautilus использует гарантии (по сути, страхование инвестиций) для масштабного привлечения частного капитала в проекты повышения прибрежной и океанической устойчивости. Nautilus предлагает структуру «обещанных выплат», которая снижает риски дефолта для инвесторов, и старается, опираясь на собственные капиталы, поддерживать проекты устойчивой синей экономики, начиная с малых и средних предприятий и заканчивая крупными инфраструктурными проектами. Такая стратегия помогает уменьшить воспринимаемые риски, повысить уверенность инвесторов и привлечь частное финансирование в океанические инициативы во всём мире, способствующие климатической устойчивости и регенерации экосистем. Чтобы уменьшить дефицит защиты устойчивой синей экономики, мы должны создавать партнёрства между страховыми компаниями, инвесторами и властями, задействуя опыт, знания и ресурсы как государственного, так и частного сектора. Такие частно-государственные партнёрства будут преследовать одну цель: помогать находить инновационные решения для климатической адаптации и управления рисками, которые помогут уязвимым группам населения. Совместная работа участников форума IDF и альянса ORRAA стала ярким примером использования государственных, частных и филантропических ресурсов для масштабного увеличения инвестиций в природные решения (защиту коралловых рифов, восстановление мангровых зарослей и так далее). Объединив суверенные риски, островные государства смогли вместе получить доступ к недорогому страхованию и показали ещё один полезный пример повышения финансовой устойчивости в условиях климатических катастроф. На Форуме синих финансов и экономики и Конференции ООН по океану, которые пройдут в июне в Монако и Ницце, будет подчеркиваться возросшая роль страховой отрасли в повышении климатической устойчивости океанов. Но для значимого прогресса нужна многогранная стратегия расширения доступа к таким видам страхования, как параметрическое покрытие. Повысить доступность и адаптировать страхование к местным реалиям можно, инвестируя в сбор данных и моделирование рисков, что улучшит наше понимание и оценку угроз, связанных с океаном. «Индекс прибрежных рисков», публикуемый ORRAA и AXA, показывает, как подходы с опорой на данные могут радикально улучшить ситуацию с климатической устойчивостью. Но что, наверное, самое важное, учитывая беспрецедентные масштабы климатической проблемы, для обеспечения защиты потребуются комплексные подходы, которые объединят знания отрасли о риск-менеджменте, инновационные финансовые инструменты, стратегическое использование капиталов. Массовое внедрение природных страховых продуктов позволит не только уменьшить физические риски, но и поддержит биоразнообразие, здоровье экосистем. Укрепляя природную береговую защиту, мы сможем полностью раскрыть экономический и экологический потенциал устойчивого океана, создать процветающую синюю экономику.

Title: Nvidia and xAI Sign On to $30 Billion AI Infrastructure Fund
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/nvidia-and-xai-sign-on-to-30-billion-ai-infrastructure-fund/

Elon Musk’s xAI and chipmaker Nvidia have joined a $30 billion artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project. The AI Infrastructure Fund, backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, announced the two-high profile sign-ups Wednesday (March 19), noting that their ultimate goal was to raise up to $100 billion for artificial intelligence (AI) development. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs,” he added. Microsoft and Blackrock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities. The announcement comes one day after Huang told attendees at the Nvidia developer conference that massive computing power is required to enable the current trajectory of AI as it moves toward agents and reasoning models. “AI is going through an inflection point,” the CEO said at the event, nicknamed “AI Woodstock,” adding that the shift to agentic and reasoning means “the amount of computation necessary to train those models, and to inference those models, has grown tremendously.” Traditional large language models need much less computing power than AI agents and reasoning models, but they also answer immediately. Reasoning models need much more power because they go back and forth reasoning among themselves before responding, which in many cases would take longer. “In order for us to keep the model responsive, so that we don’t lose our patience waiting for it to think, we now have to compute 10 times faster,” Huang said. “The amount of computation we have to do is 100 times more, easily.” As PYMNTS noted, Huang was making the case that the AI industry will still require a lot of Nvidia GPUs following a flurry of news in January surrounding the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. That company said it had trained its high-performing foundation AI model using only 2,000 slower Nvidia H800 chips instead of typically tens of thousands or more for companies like OpenAI. The BlackRock/Microsoft fund isn’t the only multi-billion dollar effort to finance AI infrastructure projects. In January, SoftBank and OpenAI unveiled their “Stargate” project to develop AI infrastructure, with plans to spend up to $100 billion.

Title: What Levers Do China and Hong Kong Have Over CK Hutchison’s Port Deal?

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG, March 19 (Reuters) – Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison is facing intense criticism from Beijing over its ports sale to a BlackRock-led consortium, fueling speculation as to whether China could take steps to scupper the deal. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted two state media commentaries over the past week depicting the deal, which includes the sale of assets near the Panama Canal, as a betrayal of China and contrary to its national interests. The deal could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported, which could result in higher port and logistics costs for Chinese entities and pose a risk to Chinese supply chains. Here’s a look at what potential legal or policy levers Beijing and Hong Kong could deploy against the company. While some analysts say China’s regulatory reach is limited as none of the ports being sold are in China or Hong Kong, some legal experts say Beijing could still review the transaction. The State Administrative Market Regulation Authority could have extra-territorial jurisdiction by applying the anti-monopoly law, if a deal outside mainland China has the effect of eliminating or restricting competition in China’s domestic market. Authorities could also use the Measures for Security Review or Foreign Investments, implemented in 2021, to examine foreign direct investments in important fields relating to national security, including infrastructure. Felix Ng, a partner at law firm Haldanes, said the measures removed the exclusion of acquisitions of interest held by foreign companies, “suggesting that PRC authorities may have the power to review foreign-to-foreign transactions if the target involves PRC-related entities”. While CK Hutchison is registered offshore, it has businesses and a presence in China and Beijing may be able to use this as justification for weighing in, Ng said. The company did not respond to questions about the potential scrutiny. Lawyers said Hong Kong lacked regulations requiring government screening of sales of strategic assets, reflecting its traditional role as a free-wheeling entrepot. That left the government with few options beyond the blunt and broad instrument of the 2020 National Security Law to probe foreign deals involving local firms. The Beijing-imposed law punishes terrorism, collusion with foreign forces, subversion and secession with possible life imprisonment. “Given the sensitivities, there would be room for further investigation under the broad sweep of the National Security Law, particularly over collusion or espionage,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school. The offense of collusion would have to involve a person or company intending to disrupt the policies of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments to create serious consequences, Young said. Likewise, espionage would have to involve a person intending to endanger national security by communicating or providing information useful to an external force. “I don’t know if there is evidence of an intention to endanger national security by entering into the ports agreement,” he said. The Hong Kong government did not respond to a request for comment. While some politicians and analysts also say it’s hard to see how the deal could violate security laws, the Secretary for Security can give notice that relevant persons or organizations must not, directly or indirectly, deal with a property that is reasonably suspected to be related to offenses endangering national security. The Secretary for Justice, the Secretary for Security or a police officer may exercise the power to freeze, restrain, confiscate and forfeit property relating to the commission of an offense endangering national security. Article 29 of the law states that an act “seriously disrupting the formulation and implementation of laws or policies” by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments “which is likely to cause serious consequences” could constitute an offense under collusion with foreign forces. The law also has an extrajudicial scope, and applies to both residents and non-residents. Hong Kong authorities used the security legislation and the implementation rules in 2021 to freeze the assets of Next Digital, invoking powers to force the liquidation of the listed company of jailed pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai.

Two of the biggest forces in artificial intelligence (AI) — Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia — have joined BlackRock, Microsoft and investment fund MGX’s group to expand AI infrastructure across the U.S., the companies announced Wednesday. The fund — called the AI Infrastructure Partnership — at its formation in September of last year, said that it plans to launch with more than $30 billion in initial funding. The goal is to build data centers and energy projects which are required to power large-scale AI models. Nvidia will also serve as a technical advisor for the group, which it had announced last year. Musk and Nvidia join the effort two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the formation of Stargate, a private venture that plans to build up to 20 large AI data centers in the U.S. in partnership with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The first data center will be built in Abilene, a small city in Texas, which will be completed by mid-2026, Bloomberg reported yesterday. It will have space for roughly 400,000 of Nvidia’s AI chips and a capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of power.

Title: The Evolution of Structured Crypto Products
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/03/19/the-evolution-of-structured-crypto-products
Time Published: 2025-03-19T15:26:27Z
Full Content:
Australia-based digital asset firm Zerocap is in a prime position to observe the development of the structured product space, having operated OTC, market making, derivatives and crypto custody businesses since it was founded in 2018. Here Zerocap’s head of sales Mark Hiriart discusses how these products are changing, a new semi-principal protected product his firm is launching, how demand for structured products varies by geographical region, and the most unusual structured product request he’s seen. Tell us about Zerocap. Zerocap is Australia's leading institutional digital assets firm, established in 2018. We operate multiple business lines including an OTC desk, market making and derivatives business, all underpinned by our custody offering. We operate as a Corporate Authorised Representative of an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) holder, which authorizes us to trade financial products like derivatives with wholesale accredited investors. We have also established a number of high-profile partnerships with institutions like ANZ Bank for their stablecoin, and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for various proof of concepts and pilots. While we've become the leading liquidity player in Australia over the last 18 months, our reach extends to clients in over 50 countries. You recently announced a new product — tell us about it. We've partnered with CoinDesk Indices to launch a semi-principal-protected structure on the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). The product offers upside exposure to the CD20 with principal protection limiting downside risk to 5%, while offering up to 40% return potential on the upside. This is the first in a series of structured products we'll be creating with CoinDesk Indices, featuring different payoffs for various risk appetites. The timing is particularly relevant given the current market sentiment. With the rally in digital assets around Trump and potential global trade headwinds to navigate, we anticipate some sideways action in the near term. This medium-risk exposure product is well-suited to the current macro environment. What gap in the market does your new product fill, and who is it designed for? In the digital asset space, we don't have established benchmarks like there are in traditional markets. For example, if an Australian investor or someone in Hong Kong wants U.S. tech exposure, they typically look for products linked to the NASDAQ or QQQ ETF. In crypto, we haven't had that level of indexization yet. This product is designed for three groups: family offices and high-net-worth individuals seeking to enter the space; investors wanting broad-based crypto exposure without deep diving into individual assets; and those who understand bitcoin but want diversified exposure with managed risk. Why did you choose to base it on the CoinDesk 20 Index? We selected the CoinDesk 20 Index for four key reasons. One, we deeply respect the CoinDesk brand and their index team's quality. Two, our strong relationship with Bullish provides access to futures contracts for hedging. Three, there's a clear market need for index products in the crypto space. And lastly, my background in equity derivatives at investment banks shows me how people use these products, and it's a natural evolution for crypto. How are structured products evolving? Two main factors have historically limited structured product adoption: one, high crypto volatility meant simple spot positions could provide significant returns, and two, the prevalence of perpetual futures with high leverage reduced demand for options markets. That balance is shifting, however, as more participants hold structural positions. Venture funds, portfolio managers with value-based allocation policies and large mandate holders need specific hedging solutions that perpetuals can't provide due to path dependency. What impact is the advent of crypto ETFs having on structured products? ETFs serve as a "gateway drug" to structured products rather than cannibalizing them. The introduction of products like the BlackRock ETF has brought new participants into the crypto space. As these investors become comfortable with crypto exposure through ETFs, they naturally progress to exploring more sophisticated products for enhanced returns or risk management. What institutional demand patterns are you seeing for crypto structured products in Asia versus other regions? Asia typically shows a strong appetite for auto-call structures, where investors sell downside or puts to receive large coupons based on price targets on the upside. This differs from the more conservative approach in U.S. and European markets. Having worked at JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley in equity derivatives trading, I've seen these regional differences firsthand. Australia sits somewhere in between, and at Zerocap, we've successfully converted non-structured product players into crypto structured product users. We're looking to expand this expertise into Asia, subject to regulatory requirements. Are we at risk of over-engineering crypto's volatility out of existence? As crypto develops, different assets naturally have different volatility profiles. While stablecoins maintain stability and bitcoin's volatility may dampen with institutional adoption, there's still plenty of opportunity for high-volatility exposure down the market cap curve, from Solana to memecoins. The market is maturing to cater to different investor needs. For portfolio allocation, whether it's 1%, 2% or 5%, investors need broad beta exposure through established assets like bitcoin and ether, complemented by smaller allocations to emerging opportunities. What’s been the most unusual structured product request you’ve seen? We are one of the few desks globally that offer derivatives on alt coins and hence we get asked to price some wild and wacky things. I can officially confirm that we have traded an option on FARTCOIN recently, which is quite something for someone who has spent his career at the big US banks! With that in mind, where do you see DeFi and traditional structured products intersecting? While DeFi and structured products present interesting opportunities, we need to acknowledge that crypto is already complex, and structured products add another layer of complexity. However, tokenization makes sense for legal documentation and fungibility, since you can audit source code to understand exactly what you're getting. This space will grow with real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, but widespread adoption may take time. When do you think digital assets will become long-term investments? The transition from trading vehicles to long-term investments will occur as protocols and tokens demonstrate clear value propositions and use cases. Bitcoin has proven itself to be viewed as digital gold, while it is still debatable to callEthereum "ultrasound money”. Other protocols are still fighting to find their niche and demonstrate tangible value in the digital economy. As these assets become more integrated into economic systems, their long-term value propositions will become more measurable. For more information visit https://zerocap.com/.

Title: China Market Update: Tencent’s Terrific Q4 AI-Nnounced!

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN Tencent reported Q4 financial results after the Hong Kong close that beat analyst expectations. The solid quarter was driven by “AI-powered enhancements to our advertising platform, higher engagement in Video Accounts, and growth in our evergreen games,” according to Founder, Chairman, and CEO Ma “Pony” Huateng. The company emphasized AI in their press release with Ma’s quote “we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products”. The presentation dedicated an entire section to AI, noting the company spent $10.7 billion on AI in 2024, which has a capex of 12% of revenue, up from 2023’s $3.4 billion when capex accounted for 4% of revenue. The press conference and analyst Q&A were dominated by AI talk as well. In a good sign for the company and China’s economy, the company noted, “Advertising spending rose across most major categories during the quarter.” Advertisers don’t spend ad dollars if no one is buying! Hat tip to management for the shareholder-friendly buyback and dividend policies! Here are some highlights: Asian equities were mixed overnight on light volumes as Indonesia and Thailand outperformed, and investors waited for Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Reserve announcement. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room as value stocks outperformed growth stocks in both markets. Utilities were the best-performing sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, up +0.92% and +1.26%, respectively, after the NDRC promoted renewable energy. Some media/press attention to BofA’s China strategist calling for a correction by comparing today’s rally to the 2015 rally. I’ve not read the report, but I am skeptical as I find the comparison ridiculous. The 2015 rally was driven by legal and illegal margin debt. As noted yesterday, U.S. flows into U.S.-listed China equity ETFs is less than $1 billion year-to-date despite significant outperformance versus U.S. stocks. U.S.-listed European-focused ETFs have received $5.8 billion YTD. Going back to mid-January 2024’s China equity bottom, the outperformance versus U.S. stocks is very significant, but there are no flows and no love from U.S. investors The geopolitical headwind and constant negative U.S./Western media headlines would change with a Trump-Xi meeting. Some chatter that this could occur in June, though nothing definitive yet Corrections will occur and are healthy, though I suspect dips will be bought. Wednesday’s Hong Kong dip was bought by Mainland investors with a healthy $1.52 billion of net buying of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Alibaba and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF were significant large buys. Hong Kong internet stocks were mixed ahead of Tencent’s Q4 results, with KE Holdings down -10.71% post yesterday’s Q4 results. BYD gained +3.89% in Hong Kong and +3.25% in Mainland China following yesterday’s 5-minute battery recharge release. The Ministry of Transport announced a subsidy for cities to trade in their gas buses for electric vehicle buses, which is in the company’s sweet spot. The Financial Times has an article stating that BYD was told to tap the brakes on building a plant in Mexico due to the Chinese government’s worry the technology might “leak” to U.S. rivals. I have one minor issue with the article. BYD has an EV bus plant in California. Maybe BYD should wait for Trump and Xi to meet and build an EV car plant in the U.S. Interesting that the Hong Kong government CEO criticized CK Hutchison (1 HK), which gained +1.22%, for selling their Panama ports to BlackRock. The company got $19 billion, and the stock ripped higher on the news, indicating they got a good deal. Worth noting that Premier Li signed a State Council decree on “Regulations of the State Council on the Handling of International Intellectual Property Disputes.” The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech diverged +0.12% and -1.05%, respectively, on volume down -4.92% from yesterday which is 167% of the 1-year average. 240 stocks advanced, while 231 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +12.75% from yesterday, which is 170% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). Quality and large capitalization stocks outperformed value, growth, and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +0.92%, healthcare, up +0.92%, and materials, up +0.87%, while real estate fell -0.98%, consumer discretionary fell -0.86%, and communication services fell -0.4%. The top sub-sectors were consumer services, national defense, and media, while household appliances, real estate management, and telecommunication services were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors bought $1.52 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs led by HK Tracker ETF and Alibaba large net buys, XPeng, Xiaomi, and Dobot small net buys, Tencent and SMIC small/moderate net sells, and Meituan a large/moderate net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.10%, -0.40%, and -1.18% on volume -3.53% from yesterday, which is 123% of the 1-year average. 1,448 stocks advanced, while 3,531 declined. Value and large capitalization stocks outperformed growth and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +1.26%, financials, up +0.61%, and industrials, up +0.48%, while communication services fell -3.77%, technology fell -1.93%, and real estate fell -0.83%. The top sub-sectors were precious metals, banking, and power, while telecommunication services, communication equipment, and electronic components were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia dollar index barely fell versus the U.S. dollar. Treasury bond prices gained. Copper rose, and steel fell.

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: The crypto industry moves fast, and often, unanticipated tokens are the biggest winners. In 2021, Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) helped meager investors amass fortunes. Analysts predict a fresh wave of highly valuable currencies from Rexas Finance (RXS), Pi Network (PI), and Mantra (OM). With proper timing, $2,500 in these coins might become $95,000 or more. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next 100x Crypto in RWA Tokenization Boom Rexas Finance (RXS) is revolutionizing asset investment so anyone may invest in tokenized real-world assets. Historically, only institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals could access these assets. However, Rexas Finance democratizes access by allowing low-cost, borderless trading of tokenized valuable assets like real estate, commodities, collectibles, etc. Despite being in its early stages, Wall Street heavyweights like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs have already embraced RWA tokenization. By 2030, experts project market growth of $30 trillion. With a strong ecosystem, Rexas Finance is tipped to outperform most trending crypto projects in the niche. It offers advanced tokenization, DeFi, and AI-driven features like the Rexas Token Builder, which helps non-coders build blockchain tokens. Businesses, developers, and institutions seeking to tokenize assets or start new projects will find this innovative. Rexas DeFi is a decentralized financial ecosystem that offers yield farming, staking, and liquidity pools. Projects like Rexas Finance, which use RWA tokenization and DeFi to provide investors with passive income and foster a growing financial sector, will lead this transformation. By automating NFT and other digital art generation using AI, Rexas GenAI offers an additional advantage. As AI and blockchain become disruptive technologies, Rexas Finance combines them for exponential acceptance and growth. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance prioritizes security, and their latest Certik audit bolsters investor confidence. This certification attests to the robustness of the platform’s security. The Rexas AI shield automates smart contract auditing and prevents illicit attacks, ensuring safe user assets. The ongoing $1 million giveaway is another opportunity for the top 20 participants to win $50,000 in RXS. Crypto incentives like this help boost token demand and adoption through viral marketing. This campaign and Rexas Finance’s powerful presale are setting up a stunning debut on major exchanges. As of this writing, RXS is in its final presale stage (Stage 12), with 90% of tokens sold. The price has risen from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20, representing a 567% increase before trading began. The project has raised $46.9 million, selling 454 million tokens, making it one of the year’s most successful presales. Meanwhile, RXS investors eagerly await its official debut on June 19, 2025.

Title: From COVID Mass Formation to Ukraine Mass Formation

Full Content:
DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Mar 19, 2025 | Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Coincidence, Health | 5 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Now that the COVID narrative is collapsing, a new mass formation is emerging around the story of the war in Ukraine, Professor Mattias Desmet Professor Mattias Desmet says. Emotions such as fear, frustration, and aggression are being redirected towards this new narrative. In 2020, Desmet, a professor of clinical psychology, publicized his theory that, regarding the COVID narrative, what was happening in society was a worldwide process of mass formation. This new mass formation about Ukraine has the potential to be more intense and aggressive than the COVID one, Prof. Desmet warns. He believes the way of words rather than the way of war should be pursued to truly help Ukraine. From Corona to Ukraine – The New Mass Formation Dear friends, followers, and critics, We are at a pivotal moment. On one hand, we are witnessing the collapse of the corona narrative; on the other, we are seeing a new mass formation arising around the story of the war in Ukraine. These two phenomena are not occurring by chance at the same time. Table of Contents What everyone who wanted to know had already long known is now slowly seeping through to newspapers and news programs: we can stop blaming the bats from Wuhan. The coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, where, indeed, they were experimenting with coronaviruses. What is now emerging in the corporate media is even worse than just the fact that the virus came from a laboratory. It is also becoming clear that (some of) those who promoted the measures always knew it came from a laboratory. People like Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier warned from the start of the crisis that certain sequences in the virus’ DNA do not occur in nature and that the virus was a so-called “gain-of-function” creation. He was dismissed by the media and by government-paid “research journalists” and “fact-checkers” as a charlatan and conspiracy theorist. He was simply right. It shows something of the ruthlessness with which the truth was suppressed during the crisis. Be sure to also listen to Mark Zuckerberg’s public confession with Joe Rogan. He explains there exactly why he wants to stop the fact-checking on Meta. The fact-checkers are primarily propaganda tools. They mainly serve to divert attention from the truth. Does the origin of the virus ultimately matter? Yes, it does. It further demonstrates the dramatic failure of the entire technocratic and rationalistic approach to life and living together. Not only did the technological remedy for the disease fail (for example, the mRNA vaccines did not stop the spread of the virus), but this approach now also turns out to be responsible for the disease itself (i.e., it produced the virus). Now that we agree the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory, the next question arises: what did virologist Anthony Fauci have to do with that lab? For those who want to know a bit more, click on THIS link to a document from the US Congress. Or read the last two books of that damned new health minister in the USA, the anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist Kennedy. Perhaps his mouth, like that of Professor Montagnier, generally speaks the truth on this matter as well? And the media may slowly warm up to answering the following questions. First question: What about the mortality rate of that gain-of-function virus? Why did the world go along for so long with mortality statistics that even the authors of them had stated in a hearing for “The House of Commons” in 2020 were much too high? Second question: Did the vaccines stop the spread of the virus? The assumption that this was the case led to the group of people who refused the vaccine being treated as second-class citizens. They were banned from restaurants, theatres, airplanes, and a few other things. They were pointed at by politicians worldwide as those who caused the pandemic. “The pandemic of the unvaccinated” – you remember that if you were part of that group. Who still doubts that this whole dehumanizing policy was anything but based on facts? The vaccine did not stop the spread of the virus. As for the question of how safe it was, we will wait a bit. We’ll be ready for that once the previous two questions are answered. Despite the obvious failure of the corona policy, the proponents are preparing to apply the same strategy for the next virus outbreak (I wonder if it will come from a laboratory again). The WHO, for example, has already bought the corona-surveillance technology (the system with the QR codes and so on) from the EU to further develop it into a digital vaccination passport. It is to become part of a broader digital identity and a linked social-credit system and a digital currency (the so-called Central Bank Digital Coins). To the extent that one is seduced in life by the idea of order and control, it is indeed a very attractive idea: to neatly reorganize the entire wriggling heap of society digitally and reduce the human ecological footprint by rewarding and punishing “good” and “bad” behavior. Children have to be raised, don’t they? And aren’t we all little, irresponsible children? In a way, yes. The question is: which little child is going to raise the other little children? Like any totalitarian system, the current technocratic system learns nothing from the disasters it causes. It sails blindly and fanatically on the ideological wind toward the rocks of its next failure. It sacrifices the next generation of its victims in anticipation of a technological paradise that will always remain a utopia on the horizon. Totalitarian systems always live on credit. Later, when the system is running perfectly, they will compensate for the disasters they are currently causing. And that’s why they will continue to cause disasters for the time being. I could go into many other aspects of the corona crisis, but I will leave it here for now. I prefer to ask myself the question: why is the corona story collapsing now? Perhaps because insight progresses slowly and we are only now beginning to see what happened during those strange years? I don’t think so. The appearance of the truth in the corporate media has little or nothing to do with the progress of insight. Even a small child could see from the beginning that the story was falling apart in every direction. There were, therefore, other reasons for being blind to it than the insight not being far enough advanced. The corona story is collapsing now because all the emotions that had found refuge in it – fear, frustration, aggression, the drive toward self-destruction of the completely isolated person – have slowly found a new refuge: the story of the war in Ukraine and the prospect of a new world war. All the fear, frustration, and aggression that had been linked to the coronavirus and “the anti-vaxxers” are now linked to a new object: “Putin” and “the Russians.” The great vital forces – the true Masters of man – have found a new story to take refuge in. The corona house remains abandoned, shrinking like a house left behind by its inhabitants, to the point that even a small push from a small mind is enough to make it collapse. If the current series of crises teaches us anything about humanity, it is this: man is not primarily a rational being; he is a being governed by vital and metaphysical forces to which his reason is radically subordinated. The new mass formation has the potential to be more intense and aggressive than the previous one. The reason, I have explained many times: the previous mass formation only increased loneliness and the fear and aggression linked to it. Mass formations seem to take away loneliness. Hence the bewildering enthusiasm we witnessed in, for example, videos of dancing nurses and doctors. That enthusiasm is based on an illusion. In reality, the mass only makes loneliness and all the dark feelings attached to it greater. In the mass, solidarity, and connection with fellow human beings are strictly forbidden. The only solidarity allowed is solidarity with the collective. And to that, every form of solidarity and connection with another person is radically subordinated. The dramatic endpoint of this is the mother who reports her child to the state and proudly receives a medal on the scaffold for her unwavering loyalty to the collective. In Europe, the call for war is growing louder. Now that the great monster Trump no longer wants to protect Europe, the urgent need arises to mobilize a proper army and weapon system, it is said. President Ursula von der Leyen goes so far as to say that she wants to use the savings of the population – a sloppy 800 billion – to make the war industry run at full speed. Let me be clear: I have no need to tell a pro-Putin story. My opinion is neither pro nor con. My opinion is that the way of words, rather than the way of war, should be pursued. It is certainly not a matter of convincing you not to help Ukraine; it is a matter of thinking together with you about how we can truly help Ukraine. And that will not be by plunging the world into a third world war. That Putin is no saint, no one needs to convince me of that. I have written a long article on Russia under Putin. Putin rose from street boy to director of the FSB, the successor of the infamous Soviet KGB. Anyone who has any knowledge of the workings and nature of that secret service knows that its director will not exactly be a sentimental soft-boiled egg. Putin keeps a great power afloat. And he does that like leaders of great powers do. For example, the Moscow regime uses false flag operations in which hundreds of its own citizens die to create support for war in breakaway republics like Chechnya, and it eliminates journalists who speak uncomfortable truths. That being said, the way the war story is now portrayed in the media bears the same absurd characteristics as the corona story did at the time. Russia is, in some respects, an expansionist nation. But its expansionism is a small beer compared to that of NATO and the USA. Here is my modest opinion: Russia knows that in the great expansionist struggle, it might lose, and if it comes to war, it is largely because it feels that it has a knife to its throat. In this article from ten years ago – written in tempore non suspecto – you can read that the geopolitical manoeuvres of NATO in the Black Sea region would inevitably lead to war with Russia. Those manoeuvres were merely the point of the spear directed at Russia in a much larger expansionist USA project. Since WWII, the USA has, by most estimates, built between 700 and 800 military bases abroad. To those who are so convinced that Russia is the only aggressor in the Ukraine story: try looking through the eyes of the Kremlin. How would Europe or America feel if, under the cover of many beautiful stories about “democracy,” Russia marched toward Brussels or Washington with hundreds of military bases? Or also look at the history of the regime change operations of the USA since WWII. Anyone who takes the trouble to learn about recent history will see how South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe were gradually politically and militarily subjected by the USA and/or NATO. I have previously written an article on the historical context of the war in Ukraine. I will not go into it in detail here. You can find the article via THIS link. In short, it is not true that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was “unprovoked.” Since the American-initiated regime change of 2014 in Maidan Square, there have been roughly three reasons that drove Russia to start the war. First, the Russians had humanitarian reasons. After 2014, the Kiev regime oppressed the ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine (especially the Donbas region). This was not exactly done gently. Kiev even used cluster bombs in densely populated neighborhoods, which led to hundreds of thousands of refugees seeking safety in Russia. I don’t know if Putin invaded Ukraine out of humanitarian concern. It is quite possible that he didn’t want to let his authority as a leader be undermined by allowing the regime in Kiev to commit atrocities against Russian-speaking Ukrainians. But this is enough to make clear that we cannot simply speak in black-and-white terms about “the bad Russians” and “the good Ukrainians.” That much I know. Second, there were economic reasons. Since 2014, Ukraine’s vast natural resource reserves (especially minerals) were at risk of falling into American hands. The pro-American regimes that came to power in Ukraine after 2014 lifted the law that stated that foreigners could only buy up to two hectares of land in Ukraine. In no time, American companies like Cargill, Monsanto, and Du Pont bought up a third of Ukrainian land, and investment giants like Blackrock signed contracts for the supply of weapons for the war (which they knew was inevitable) and for the reconstruction of the country after that war. Or how one can make a lot of money in a short time by throwing all ethical considerations overboard. Additionally, there are important strategic reasons involved in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Think mainly of the importance of ensuring access to the Black Sea region for Russia. If Russia does not have access to the Black Sea, it will cease to exist as a great power in the near future. NATO knows this well because they are using the militarization of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region to apply the strategy Lord Palmerston used in the 19th century, which led to the first Crimean War. This strategy was revived at the end of the 20th century by Brzezinski in his book ‘The Grand Chessboard.’ It is well-known that the so-called neocons, who in many ways pull the strings in the USA and NATO, adopted Brzezinski’s strategy as their own. I believe that any sober analysis of the situation will conclude that Putin and Russia had a choice: either they invaded Ukraine, or it was over for Russia as a great power. Moreover, Putin already made it clear at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest that Ukraine was the red line: if NATO made moves to annex Ukraine after the rest of Eastern Europe, war was the only outcome. He probably didn’t need to explain it to them; they knew it better than him. Any analysis of the historical data shows that the European and American leaders at that time realized that their maneuvers in Ukraine were almost inevitably heading toward a third world war. So, we are witnessing a struggle between great powers. One is more expansionist than the other, and one is more successful in the dirty military game than the other. Like all great powers, they feel threatened in their dominance. Great powers are subject to the law of the Ego: the more power one has, the more fearful and aggressive one becomes. Like all great powers, they use all the harmful strategic and military techniques of our rationalist time. Both thrive on propaganda, including false flag operations where, if necessary, their own citizens are sacrificed to influence public opinion. And both do not shy away from political persecution and murder. The population should not so much choose between one of these two great powers; they must make it clear that a large-scale military and nuclear conflict is not an option, and that at least the way of words must be fully explored first. Putin is a human being, the Russians are human beings. And a human being wants to be heard. There are enough reasons to listen carefully to what the Russians have to say. I do not want to say with this article that Ukraine should be left to its fate. Certainly not. What I do want to say is that the lead-up to a conflict and the intentions behind it must be assessed and portrayed as accurately as possible. And that we should certainly be cautious about fuelling a war that, with diplomacy and a little bit of introspection, might be stopped. That is the only way we can truly offer the suffering men, women, and children of Ukraine the prospect of ending this senseless violence. It is an illusion to think that a looming nuclear inferno, which threatens to wipe out all life on this planet, will wake the masses up from their mass formation. The mass is an organism that thrives on death drive. Its ultimate goal is self-destruction. The person who slides into mass formation has already chosen death, the death of all others, and their own death. The only thing that can stop this tendency is the courage to speak the truth to those who feel that something is wrong with the war story. A mass formation always develops under a growing veil of illusion, a one-sided and misleading danger that attributes all the misfortune in the world to one object. It is that illusion that must be broken with words, words that are spoken from the realization of the limitation of all knowledge, from the realization that the truth cannot and should not be fully said, from the realization that the one who thinks and is different is ultimately also a human being, from the realization that the Other is only our enemy in illusion. Mattias Mattias Desmet is recognized as the world’s leading expert on the theory of mass formation as it applies to the COVID-19 pandemic. He is a professor of clinical psychology in the Department of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University, Belgium, and a practicing psychoanalytic psychotherapist. He is well-known in academic circles for his research on fraud within academia. He is the author of over one hundred peer-reviewed academic papers and is the author of the books ‘The Psychology of Totalitarianism’, ‘The Pursuit of Objectivity in Psychology’ and ‘Lacan’s Logic of Subjectivity: A Walk on the Graph of Desire’.

Title: ‘The Floodgates Open’—Bitcoin And Crypto Brace For A $9 Trillion Fed Price Flip

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/19 update below. This post was originally published on March 18 Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto. Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump’s White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell could step in to support markets, including the bitcoin price ... [+] and cryptocurrencies, according to BitMex cofounder Arthur Hayes. “When there’s financial distress, they always print money. It doesn’t matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump’s on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession. 03/19 update: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is "between a rock and a hard place," Wells Fargo’s chief economist has told the Wall Street Journal, with the Fed likely to hold rates steady today as it grapples with the prospect of Donald Trump’s trade war fueling an inflation bump but also dampening economic growth. Traders are whispering that Powell could announce an end to the Fed’s balance sheet runoff program, known as quantitative tightening, which could boost the bitcoin price, crypto and stock markets. “Our rates strategists expect the statement to indicate that the Fed is pausing quantitative tightening until the debt ceiling is resolved, as suggested in the January meeting minutes,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note seen by Coindesk. “They do not expect to restart after the debt ceiling is addressed, but the announcement won’t be made until later this year.” The Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s 2:30pm ET press conference. "Late last year, Fed chair Powell hinted that the end of [quantitative tightening] was coming in 2025. If he mentions it in [today’s statement or press conference (I imagine someone will ask him), that would end up signalling that we’re in a new monetary regime, and that the Fed stands ready to resume additional debt purchases should [quantitative easing] become necessary again," Noelle Acheson, editor of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, wrote in an emailed note. "While renewed [quantitative easing] is unlikely any time soon, the additional liquidity from a large buyer (the Fed) coming back into the market to replace maturing holdings would be good news," Acheson wrote, adding the Treasury market is facing $9 trillion in debt maturity this year that quantitative tightening could disrupt. "When the floodgates open, it’s go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they’re going to reflate and print more money than anyone’s ever printed before.” The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing. “We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said. Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its recent highs of around $110,000 per bitcoin, dragging ... [+] down the wider crypto market. “All eyes are on the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week,” BlackRock analysts wrote in a note. The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed’s latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump’s campaign to see them brought down. Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell’s all-important, post-decision press conference.

Title: Forbes Daily: Alphabet’s $32B Wiz Deal Is Its Largest Acquisition Yet

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff. Budget carrier Frontier Airlines is taking a page from its competitor Southwest’s book. Frontier is now selling “economy bundles” that include a free carry-on bag, as well as offering a promotion for an additional, free checked bag for summer travel—that perk goes into effect the same day Southwest plans to end its popular two free checked bags policy. And “if travelers show us the love,” CEO Barry Biffle said the airline could make the perks permanent. Still, it’s unclear if that will happen, since roughly $650 million—or around 17%—of Frontier’s total revenue in 2024 came from baggage fees. Win McNamee/Getty Images U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke of President Donald Trump on Tuesday, saying that Trump’s call to impeach a federal judge is inappropriate. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that Trump’s executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 should be paused for 14 days, and is now looking into whether the Trump Administration defied the order by sending more than 260 migrants to a prison in El Salvador. Google parent company Alphabet is making its largest acquisition ever with a $32 billion all-cash deal to buy Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz, which will make its four cofounders worth about $2.2 billion apiece. Forbes profiled the company in 2023, highlighting its aggressive growth strategy that at the time raised eyebrows from some industry peers. San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images In the latest sign of the apparent corporate retreat from DEI, organizers behind one of the country’s largest LGBTQ Pride celebrations say an abnormal number of companies have pulled out of sponsoring this year’s march. San Francisco Pride organizers confirmed to Forbes four companies that dropped out of supporting its celebrations this year, and according to SFGate, the loss of sponsorships represents $300,000 in funding—slightly less than a tenth of the $3.2 million budgeted for SF Pride’s June events. Distributed Spectrum cofounders Ben Harpe, Isaac Struhl and Alex Wuff. Distributed Spectrum, a company founded by Harvard students, is making tiny AI-powered sensors to help the U.S. military locate enemy troops and drones via radio emissions. On Tuesday, the company announced it has raised $25 million in a Series A funding round. The need for such devices is perhaps most apparent in Ukraine, where radio waves are powering everything from warfare communication to guided missiles and explosive-laden drones. A judge ruled that Elon Musk’s and DOGE’s efforts to dismantle USAID are likely unconstitutional, and ordered the Trump Administration to restore the foreign aid agency’s functionality. The administration has sought to distance Musk from the widespread federal cuts, and the case is one of several that take aim at the billionaire’s authority over the federal government. The Trump Organization previously tried and failed to expand into Ukraine, long before Trump’s first presidency and the war with Russia, according to testimony Donald Trump gave in 2007. Trump was interested in developing a hotel in Kiev sometime prior to March 2005 as part of broader expansion plans, he explained during a sworn deposition in a lawsuit he filed against journalist Timothy O’Brien and his publisher. Purdue Pharma submitted a new bankruptcy plan Tuesday, which will give its creditors more than $7.4 billion in cash—including up to $7 billion in payments from the billionaire Sackler family—to help compensate the victims of the opioid crisis, after the Supreme Court struck down the company’s previous settlement plan. Under the plan, the drugmaker would be dissolved and a new “public benefit company” would absorb its assets. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a limited ceasefire Tuesday that involves temporarily not attacking Ukrainian energy and infrastructure targets, after a highly anticipated phone call with President Donald Trump, but stopped short of agreeing to a full ceasefire. It’s unclear whether the leaders discussed land and power plants seized in the war, a major factor in permanently ending the conflict, though Trump said Sunday he would discuss “dividing up certain assets.” Tax Day is just around the corner, but it’s been a slow start to the tax season, and the millions of taxpayers who still need to file could consider filing for an extension if they’re not ready. It’s most important to ensure your return is accurate, and the extension will be granted automatically as long as you follow the rules. The National Archives on Tuesday released a massive tranche of documents pertaining to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, after President Donald Trump vowed “all” records surrounding the JFK assassination would be publicly released. Researchers previously estimated between 3,000 and 4,000 documents have not been released, but experts have said it’s unlikely the remaining records would contain any smoking gun that changes the government’s findings. Gianluigia Aponte President Donald Trump has touted a deal for a “large American company” to buy two ports on the Panama Canal. The deal to which he was referring was the sale of 43 ports owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for $23 billion—and the two Panama ports were just a small part of it. What Trump didn’t say: One of the two partners in the deal, Terminal Investment Limited, is an arm of Swiss shipping giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, commonly known as MSC, cofounded by Swiss-Italian billionaires Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte in 1970. While the ownership structure of the sale hasn’t been made public, the deal will turn MSC into the largest port operator in the world. MSC owns 70% of Terminal Investment, while investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners—led by U.S. billionaire Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi and now owned by BlackRock, which bought it for $12.5 billion in October—holds 20%, and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC owns the remaining 10%. Even before the CK Hutchison deal, MSC has spent more than $40 billion since January 2022, according to Forbes estimates, investing in everything from new ports to hospitals and even a high-speed rail company in Italy. The bulk of that was new ships: Over the past three years, the firm has bought or ordered 370 vessels for more than $31 billion, according to ship valuation experts VesselsValue. Ownership of MSC is split equally between Aponte and his wife Rafaela Aponte-Diamant. Forbes estimates they are each worth $37.5 billion, enough to make Aponte-Diamant the richest self-made woman in the world. WHY IT MATTERS “The Covid-19 pandemic snarled supply chains and sent freight rates surging, leading to record profits for the world's largest shipping firms,” says Forbes staff writer Giacomo Tognini. “MSC had already overtaken Maersk to become the world’s largest container shipping firm in January 2022, and it has spent the last three years spending that cash to expand its dominance by buying up companies in trucking, air cargo, tugboats, maritime logistics, freight forwarding, car carriers and more.” “That growth helped increase cofounders Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte’s net worths by a combined $58 billion since early 2022—and if regulators approve the CK Hutchison deal, MSC will become the largest port operator in the world.” MORE Meet The Greek Shipping Billionaires Getting Rich Off Russian Oil Amid the sweeping layoffs across the federal government, the Department of Defense is reportedly preparing to slash tens of thousands of positions. It wasn’t immediately clear when the cuts would be made: Between 50,000 and 60,000: The number of jobs the DoD is planning to eliminate 5% to 8%: The amount Pentagon leadership has previously said it aims to reduce its civilian workforce by, or 45,000 to 72,000 jobs More than 900,000: The number of employees in the DoD’s civilian workforce, per the Associated Press For years, we’ve been sold the idea that a successful career means earning a degree, landing a job and climbing the corporate ladder. But this route often involves compromising personal priorities, and when you tie your professional identity to one path, it can make you vulnerable—as evidenced by recent layoffs. Instead, more people are turning to non-linear careers, which can allow you to structure your professional life around what’s most important to you, grow through diverse experiences and adapt to different contexts. The NCAA March Madness college basketball tournament is set to begin this week, and many bracket challenges are offering the chance to win big prizes. What is Elon Musk’s social network X offering to anyone who completes a perfect bracket? A. $50,000 B. A free Cybertruck C. A trip to Mars D. A meet-and-greet with Musk Check your answer.

Title: Property prices up for 17th month in a row and likely to keep rising

Not enough new houses are being built to stop property prices rising continuously. Stock image Property prices were up by 8.1pc in the year to January. They have risen for the 17th month in a row. And prices are likely to keep rising as the Central Bank has cut its projections for house building for the next three years. New figures from the Central Statistics Office (CS) show home values in Dublin rose by 7.5pc. Outside Dublin they were up by 8.6pc compared with the same month last year, according to the CSO’s property price register. The median, or typical, price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to January was €360,000. This is up some €5,000 from the figure for December. The highest median price for a dwelling was €662,349 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €180,000 in Leitrim. Revenue data shows that there were 1,504 first-time buyer purchases in January 2025. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to January was A94 Blackrock with a median price of €743,500. Clones, Co Monaghan, had the least expensive price of €133,000. CSO statistician Niall Corkery said: “Residential property prices rose by 8.1pc in the 12 months to January 2025, down from 8.8pc in the year to December 2024. “In Dublin, residential property prices saw an increase of 7.5pc, while property prices outside Dublin were 8.6pc higher in January 2025 when compared with a year earlier.” In January, 3,801 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with the Revenue Commissioners. This was an increase of 5pc when compared with the 3,621 purchases in January 2024. The total value of transactions filed in January 2025 was €1.6bn. This was made up of 2,824 existing dwellings with a value of €1.2 billion, and 977 new dwellings with a value of €459.0 million. In Dublin, the highest house price growth was in Fingal at 9.5pc, while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 6.4pc. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border. Made up of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo, with rises of 12.7pc. The Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) saw prices rises by 11.9pc. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.8% rise in house prices The latest property price figures come as the Central Bank has cut its forecast for housing completions in Ireland this year and next. It follows the dramatic drop in residential construction activity at the end of 2024. The bank previously predicted 37,000 homes would be completed in 2025, but it now believes that number will be 35,000. It has also slightly reduced its forecast for next year, to 40,000, but expects there will be some catch-up in delivery, to 44,000, in 2027. The forecasts mean the bank expects government housing targets to be missed for each of the coming three years. In the Programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael set a target of building over 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030, scaling up from a 41,000 target this year to 60,000 by the end of the decade. The Government has been more bullish about output of late because of 69,000 commencements last year, which it said meant a “robust stock of new housing in the pipeline”. In its latest quarterly bulletin, the Central Bank says that several factors are restraining housing supply, including low productivity in the construction sector, delays in connecting utilities such as water, planning delays, and a shortage of zoned and serviced land in areas of high demand. A chronic shortage of homes to buy, combined with demographic changes, is keeping demand for housing strong and sending prices up. Demand for homes is also being fuelled by the State’s Help-to-Buy and First Homes schemes. These are giving new buyers more financial firepower at a time when the supply of new homes is not keeping pace with demand.

Business NVIDIA logo is seen in this illustration taken February 16, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia and Elon Musk's xAI have joined a consortium backed by Microsoft and BlackRock to expand artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., the companies said on Wednesday, as a global race to dominate the nascent technology intensifies. The group, formed last year with a goal to initially invest more than $30 billion in AI-related projects, is one of the biggest efforts to bankroll data centers and energy facilities needed to power AI applications such as ChatGPT. The additions come two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI and Oracle, with plans to mobilize up to $500 billion. Investors have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium- which includes Abu Dhabi-backed investment firm MGX and BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialized data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilize up to $100 billion, including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on U.S. partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The additions come two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI and Oracle, with plans to mobilize up to $500 billion. Investors have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium- which includes Abu Dhabi-backed investment firm MGX and BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialized data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilize up to $100 billion, including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on U.S. partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Title: As Trump Makes Panama Canal Demands, Meet The Swiss Billionaire Who Bought Two Key Ports With BlackRock

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini , Forbes Staff. During his speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4, President Donald Trump touted a deal that had closed that day for two ports on the Panama Canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” he said, to applause from the politicians gathered at the Capitol. The deal to which he was referring was the sale of 43 ports owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for $23 billion—and the two Panama ports were just a small part of it. What Trump didn’t say: one of the two partners in the deal, Terminal Investment Limited, is an arm of Swiss shipping giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, commonly known as MSC, cofounded by Swiss-Italian billionaires Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte in 1970. While the ownership structure of the sale hasn’t been made public, the deal will turn MSC into the largest port operator in the world, with stakes in more than 100 terminals in 54 countries, including eight in the U.S. and three in Panama. MSC owns 70% of Terminal Investment, while investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners—led by U.S. billionaire Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi and now owned by BlackRock, which bought it for $12.5 billion in October—holds 20% and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC owns the remaining 10%. Ogunlesi and the Apontes first teamed up in 2013, when GIP bought a 35% stake in Terminal Investment from MSC for $1.4 billion before selling part of its shares in 2019 and 2021. U.S. billionaire Adebayo Ogunlesi is cofounder of private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, which first invested in the Apontes' Terminal Investment Ltd. in 2013. Pending approval from European and Panamanian regulators, the deal will see BlackRock and Terminal Investment take over CK Hutchison’s ports outside of China and Hong Kong for a cash payment of $18 billion plus the assumption of $5 billion in debt. It’s the latest in a string of acquisitions for the Apontes, whose MSC overtook publicly traded Danish rival Maersk to become the world’s largest container shipping line in early 2022. Now, it’s set to overtake Maersk in terms of its port network as well. “[MSC’s] growth in liner shipping capacity has gone hand-in-glove with this huge expansion in terminal capacity,” says Eirik Hooper, senior associate of ports and terminals at maritime research firm Drewry. “The two businesses clearly support each other and provide opportunities for operational synergies at a huge scale.” For its part, BlackRock's investment in ports comes little more than a year after it announced the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, with the firm touting infrastructure as a $1 trillion market set to grow even further thanks to increasing investment in assets such as airports, railroads and shipping ports. BlackRock's billionaire CEO Larry Fink called infrastructure “one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities" in a statement at the time. After the CK Hutchison deal closes—and unless local regulators require it to divest from the port it currently owns—MSC will hold stakes in three ports on the Panama Canal, with two on the Pacific Ocean side and one on the Atlantic. Even before the CK Hutchison deal, MSC has spent more than $40 billion since January 2022, according to Forbes estimates, investing in everything from new ports to hospitals and even a high-speed rail company in Italy. The bulk of that was new ships: over the past three years, the firm has bought or ordered 370 vessels for more than $31 billion, according to ship valuation experts VesselsValue. The secretive, closely-held MSC doesn’t publish financial data and declined to comment on them, but according to documents obtained by Italian newspaper Il Messaggero it ended 2022 with $68 billion in cash, thanks to a surge in freight rates during the pandemic as snarled supply chains powered shipping firms to record profits. Ownership of MSC is split equally between Aponte (the chairman, who was born in Italy but is now a Swiss citizen and lives in Geneva) and his wife Rafaela Aponte-Diamant, who helped him found the firm when he quit his job at a bank and started MSC with a $200,000 loan to buy their first ship in 1970. Forbes estimates they are each worth $37.5 billion, enough to make Aponte-Diamant the richest self-made woman in the world. That’s a combined $58 billion more than their estimated net worth in early 2022. A spokesperson for MSC declined to comment on the valuation and didn’t make either Aponte available for an interview. “Even before it was clear how good the pandemic would end up being [for shippers], Aponte was buying everything that was available and expanding,” says John McCown, a shipping expert at the think tank Center for Maritime Strategy. “It’s a bold strategy, but it’s worked out for them so far.” While the pandemic-driven boom helped all shippers, MSC benefited more than its rivals. According to Il Messaggero, it posted $93 billion in revenues and $46 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2022, beating out Maersk and CMA CGM, owned by the billionaire Saadé family of France. And even as its passenger cruise line suffered—swinging from a $456 million net profit in 2019 to a three-year run of Covid-induced net losses totalling more than $3 billion—the success of its container shipping business more than made up for it: MSC’s EBITDA rose by more than 600% from 2020 to 2022, compared to 350% for Maersk and 445% for CMA CGM. MSC used the cash it earned in the pandemic years to expand its empire beyond the sea, targeting companies that transport the goods to their final destinations on land as well as picking up firms in other areas of shipping outside of containers. Since January 2022, MSC has spent more than $3.6 billion buying up stakes in 10 companies including a trucking firm, a cargo airline, a car carrier, two logistic firms, a tugboat operator and a freight forwarding outfit, which acts as an intermediary between companies shipping products and their final destination, organizing the goods' transport by sea, rail, road or air. “These freight forwarding companies are just a way of feeding the monster. It's a source of additional volume,” says McCown. “With all the compelling growth that MSC is doing, that's not surprising." Flush with cash, MSC even partnered with South African billionaire Johann Rupert’s Remgro to buy South Africa-based Mediclinic, a chain of private hospitals, for $4.6 billion in August 2022. Its next big move outside of shipping came in October 2023, when it bought 50% of Italian high-speed rail firm Italo from Ogunlesi’s Global Infrastructure Partners for $2.2 billion. MSC has operated a cruise business since 1988 and bought a Mediterranean ferry company in 2010, but this was its first foray into passenger rail. Diego Aponte, Gianluigi and Rafaela's son and MSC's president, said in a statement at the time that the purchase reflected the group's "goal of further developing sustainable modes of transport, for both passengers and cargo.” The deal closed in May 2024, and it’s likely to become another good bet for Aponte: Italo posted a $178 million profit on $926 million revenues in 2023, up 36% and 21%, respectively, over the previous year. The Apontes had also been growing their ports empire before the CK Hutchison deal. MSC bought 50% of South Korea’s Busan port in March 2022, and eight months later it purchased Bolloré Africa Logistics—a collection of container terminals, dry ports, railways and logistics services owned by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré's Bolloré Group—for $5.9 billion. The acquisition made MSC the largest logistics firm in Africa and the seventh largest port owner in the world. Last November, it acquired a 49.9% stake in German publicly traded logistics company HHLA—which owns major ports in Hamburg, Estonia, Italy and Odessa, Ukraine—for $700 million. MSC owns the largest container shipping fleet in the world with 20% of total fleet capacity, ahead of its closest rivals Maersk (14%) and CMA CGM (12%), according to shipping data firm Alphaliner. “It's beneficial to have ports that you own. It allows you to get priority,” says Ben Slupecki, an analyst at Morningstar, pointing to the benefits of buying more ports alongside a larger fleet. “These are valued assets in the industry.” All of this has helped put MSC in a stronger position than ever and likely led to its announcement in January 2023 that it planned to end its 10-year partnership with Maersk, known as the 2M alliance. First set up in 2015, the alliance, which officially expired in January, allowed the two companies to lower costs by sharing capacity on 185 ships on routes traveling from ports in northern Europe and north America to Asia. Maersk has moved onto a different alliance while MSC is going alone. “They have 20% of global capacity, so they've achieved the size where they no longer need to operate an alliance,” adds Slupecki. Besides, with partners like Ogunlesi and now Fink’s BlackRock, it likely doesn’t need more support. And Aponte isn’t done expanding: his firm is reportedly planning to increase its stake in Spanish billionaire Vicente Boluda Fos’ tugboat firm Boluda Towage to 49% by May, which would make MSC the largest towage company in the world. MSC may not be able to keep up that high spending forever. After years of breakneck growth, the tide is turning for shipping firms. Freight prices have fallen from their peak in 2022, sitting about 50% higher than their levels before the pandemic in 2019. That slowdown, combined with the potential impact of Trump’s tariffs and any ensuing trade war, could put a damper on MSC’s profits. "If the tariffs stick, it'll put a real dent in container volume to and from the U.S. That's 25% to 30% of world container miles,” adds McCown. Still, that’s a relatively small slice of the global container trade. And while MSC may have to sell part of its ports in the Netherlands and Panama to appease regulators examining the CK Hutchison deal—plus fend off a potential Chinese government investigation into the agreement itself—it will still likely own stakes in more than 100 ports, more than anyone else. That size, combined with the fact it commands the world’s largest fleet of container ships, makes it less vulnerable than its competitors to any downturn. “The largest firms that have the ability to invest, like MSC, can probably weather a pretty big storm and come out the other side,” says Slupecki. “That might not be the case for some of their competitors. In some ways, that's an advantage for them to take further market share even if they struggle.”

Global Times By Chen Qingqing Published: Mar 18, 2025 01:22 PM When asked whether the Chinese Foreign Ministry can confirm or give more details on media reports that Chinese authorities are investigating CK Hutchison's sale of its overseas ports after the company agreed to sell its Panama operations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday that "on your specific question, I'd refer you to competent authorities. Let me stress more broadly that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." After two central government bodies in Hong Kong reposted two opinion pieces criticizing CK Hutchison Holdings for its decision to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by an American asset manager BlackRock, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday, before attending the Executive Council meeting, that the HKSAR government expects foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for businesses, including Hong Kong enterprises, and opposes the use of coercion or pressure tactics in international economic and trade relations, Hong Kong media RTHK reported. When commenting on the matter on Tuesday, Lee expressed three views, according to Wen Wei Po. First, he noted that there has been much discussion in society about the issue, reflecting public concern, which deserves attention. Second, he emphasized that the HKSAR government expects foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for businesses, including Hong Kong enterprises, and opposes the use of coercion or pressure tactics. Third, he stated that any transaction must comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and the HKSAR government will handle the matter in accordance with the law and regulations, Wen Wei Po reported. Hong Kong-based Ta Kung Pao last week published two opinion pieces questioning the CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports. In the Saturday piece, it asked, "Why are so many important ports so easily transferred to the US forces that harbor malicious intentions? What kind of political calculations are hidden behind the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Has the so-called 'shrewd' deal taken into account the interests of the country and the nation? Is such a choice actually helping the evildoers and bringing harm to China and the world?" The article also warned if one fails to see clearly the true nature of those US politicians who "not only want money but also want you to die," and chooses to dance with them, one might perhaps manage to make a fortune for a while, but in the end, there will be no future, and what's more, one will incur the condemnation of history. Ta Kung Pao also published an opinion piece on Thursday saying that this deal is a hegemonic act in which the US uses its national power to usurp the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through coercion, pressure and inducement. It is a form of power politics dressed up as a "commercial act." The article urged relevant companies to think twice about the nature and crux of the issue, and also ponder about what stance to take and which side to stand on. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have reposted on their websites the two opinion pieces published by Ta Kung Pao. Leung Chun-ying, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, published a post on social media on Monday, asking without naming anyone: "Do businessmen have a motherland?" Wen Wei Po reported on Tuesday. Leung stated that some Hong Kong businessmen mistakenly believe in the notion that "business knows no borders" and assume that everything is purely business. However, businessmen without a motherland will only face bullying. He emphasized that businessmen should also prioritize their country. He pointed out that American businessmen can only act in alignment with US interests and cannot do anything that goes against them. He concluded that this inherent relationship between American businessmen and their country applies equally to other nations, including the UK, Canada, and Singaporeâ"and China is no exception." As the US is intensifying its efforts to undermine China's shipbuilding industry, shipping sector, and the Belt and Road Initiative in an attempt to contain China's rise, this deal would inevitably pose a threat to national interests and security, Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. "I believe that before making business decisions, the company should fully and seriously consider the complexity of the international landscape and the well-being of the nation and its people. After all, key infrastructure holds significant strategic value, and its critical role in great-power competition should not be underestimated," Lau added.

(ABC News: Joel Wilson) Administrators have been appointed to run the majority of Genius Childcare centres. The ABC has also found Australia’s industrial watchdog has received at least 30 requests for help from Genius workers. Genius owner Darren Misquitta did not respond to requests for comment. Administrators have taken control of the majority of childcare centres run by teetering empire Genius. Nicholas Charlwood, Alan Walker, and Glenn Livingstone of WLP Restructuring took control of 12 centres on Wednesday, bringing the total they control to 25. The ABC can also reveal that dozens of workers at Genius have lodged formal complaints about wage underpayment since 2016. Documents obtained under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws show Australia’s industrial watchdog has received at least 30 requests for help from workers at Genius, which is run by Melbourne businessman Darren Misquitta. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is investigating the group, a spokesperson told the ABC, as more employees face uncertainty in the wake of the collapses. Dozens of Genius workers have lodged complaints via the Fair Work Ombudsman. (ABC News: Joel Wilson) Genius’s financial woes come as the childcare industry is in the spotlight following a Four Corners investigation on Monday that raised concerns about child safety and revealed the sector is plagued by poor regulation and high staff turnover. Until recently, Genius was a rapidly-expanding childcare empire with at least 28 centres across the country and another 17 in development. But yesterday WLP’s partners were appointed administrators of subsidiary Abacus 49, which runs 12 centres in Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Western Australia. The administrators said they will continue to run the centres as usual while “urgently assessing the financial affairs of Abacus 49”. Finexia, a Gold Coast-based finance group that runs childcare funds, appointed the same administrators last week to take control of another Genius subsidiary, Vertical 4. The administrators are continuing to run 11 centres owned by Vertical 4. The new collapses add to the sudden shut down of centres in Adelaide, Canberra and Sydney which are in various states of collapse due to staff walkouts because of unpaid wages, landlord disputes and suspensions by state regulators for repeated child health and safety breaches. Another company in the Genius group, Horizontal 1, collapsed in December owing $9.6m. In a report to creditors last month, liquidator Paul Vartelas said Horizontal 1, which was formerly known as Genius Education, “did not have sufficient realisable current assets available to meet its short-term liabilities at any time” since June 30, 2020. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta is accused of systematically and deliberately failing to pay superannuation to employees and paying wages late. (LinkedIn) Other woes of the Genius group include a lawsuit by former employees who allege they haven’t been paid their entitlements. Jodie Henderson told the ABC she is owed at least $36,000 in unpaid redundancy entitlements and hundreds of annual leave hours, after the centre she managed in Granville, Queensland, closed abruptly last month. It was ousted by centre landlords, who changed the locks without staff knowledge, owing thousands of dollars in unpaid rent and weeks of pay to 19 now-redundant educators. “I’ve got educators who have defaulted on loan payments, mortgage payments … I’ve got educators going to food banks and to churches to get support with feeding their families,” Ms Henderson said. Jodie Henderson says Genius Childcare owes her thousands of dollars. (Supplied: Jodie Henderson) Ms Henderson said Genius had failed to issue redundant staff with separation certificates making it difficult for them to claim urgent unemployment benefits. “Between my team and myself, I’m going to estimate we’ve sent at least 40 to 50 emails to payroll requesting them, [asking] 'can you tell us what’s happening?'” she said. “And none of us have had responses.” She said staff and children had personal and medical belongings locked inside the centre, including epipens and asthma puffers. “This is most definitely the lowest of the low,” she said. “It’s left a lot of people with a very bad view of working in the early childhood sector.” Documents provided by the FWO under FOI laws show Genius workers have complained that the company hasn’t paid their full wages, given them incorrect payslips, failed to pay them for up to six weeks and failed to pay leave entitlements and superannuation. “They are ignoring me,” one former worker, who claimed Genius hadn’t paid their final wages plus annual and long service leave, told the ombudsman in a November 2016 request for assistance. Concerns about the group’s financial state were raised as early as November 2017, when a fired worker complained that she had not received her last two weeks pay and her entitlements. “They dismissed two other EEs (employees) at the same time so they may be in financial difficulties,” the worker alleged in her complaint, according to a file note. Another worker alleged she was fired from Genius after raising problems with her pay. Complaints against Genius Childcare were filed as early as 2016. (Supplied) In a 2021 complaint, a worker said that because their centre was understaffed they had to work large amounts of unpaid overtime in order to comply with minimum staff to child ratios. “The overtime I worked was due to not having enough staff therefore in the afternoons we would have to stay back until the ratio dropped enough that we could go home,” the worker said in an email to the FWO. In November last year, multiple staff complained that the company was paying wages late. One Genius worker said that “no staff have been paid, pay is late from everyone”, according to a file note made by an officer at the ombudsman. “Staff are calling management but have not heard back.” A second worker told the FWO “the entirety of the company have experienced late pay” for the past year. “She believes she was paid because the staff did not show up to work on Monday and told the business they had other job interviews lined up and they were paid within 20 minutes,” an FWO officer said in a file note. Vertical 4, which was formerly known as Genius Learning, was also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock over unpaid rent. Court documents show a property fund run by Blackrock claims to be owed more than $1.4m in rent from centres in Granville (Queensland), Corinda (Queensland), Christie Downs (South Australia) and Cranbourne West (Victoria). The administrators have plans to sell some centres and operate others in the meantime. (ABC News: Joel Wilson) Mr Charlwood, Mr Livingstone and Mr Walker said that of the 11 Vertical 4 centres they are running, there were agreements in place to immediately sell five — in Mont Albert (Victoria), Beaumaris (Victoria), Reservoir (Victoria), Kenmore (Queensland) and Gowrie (ACT). Six of the centres — in Hamilton Hill (Western Australia), Lakelands (WA), Mandurah (WA), Newcomb (Victoria), Castle Hill (NSW) and Pyrmont (NSW) — will continue to be operated by the administrators for the time being. Two additional centres, in Eumemmerring (Victoria) and Cranbourne West (Victoria), have yet to open. Mr Misquitta did not respond to requests for comment.

(Article byÂ Clayton J. BakerÂ republished from Brownstone.org) In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this:Â Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script.Â There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact thatÂ the arsonists are running the fire departmentÂ â as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well â we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach.

It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough.

They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact thatÂ the arsonists are running the fire departmentÂ â as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well â we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions. Read more at:Â Brownstone.org In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this:Â Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script.Â There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population.

In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach.

Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus.

Read more at:Â Brownstone.org Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives.

While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives.

This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency.

Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices.

The DeFi sector is “substantially undervalued,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said Tuesday in an interview with Decrypt, arguing Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui and Aptos “definitely tick the boxes” for courting institutional investors. The executive said he sees a case for issuers launching SUI and Apots ETFs in the U.S.—a development that may bring renewed investments into those altcoins. The asset manager already filed for an Aptos ETF earlier this month, but it has no such application pending for a SUI-based fund. Still, projects led by ex-Meta stablecoin team members “definitely tick the boxes of serious team, serious technology [and] technological differentiation,” Hougan said, referencing a few of Bitwise’s requirements for the assets held by its funds. “I wouldn't put 100% of my portfolio in Sui, but I wouldn't put [in] zero,” he said. Bitwise is one of several investment firms that has filed a flurry of crypto ETF applications with federal regulators in the U.S. The spate of applications comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission— the crypto industry’s main regulator in the U.S.—has signaled its willingness to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance under recently elected President Donald Trump. Issuers have requested to roll out funds tracking the prices of a wide range of cryptos, from meme coins such as Bonk and Dogecoin to larger market-cap assets like XRP and Solana to Official Trump. Bitwise itself is in the process of securing approval for single-asset ETFs that track XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—tokens that are especially popular with DeFi proponents. Although those altcoins are down from the highs they brushed last January, Hougan believes changing tides in the U.S. regulatory climate could boost DeFi tokens and the projects to which they are linked. “The market hasn’t come to grips with the fact that these tokens could change their tokenomics and be money printing machines in a new regulatory environment,” Hougan said, citing Uniswap, Ondo, and Aave as projects with enormous potential for growth. That new regulatory climate may allow utility tokens with value drivers to thrive, he said, eliminating a major issue in DeFi—the pervasiveness of “squishy governance tokens.” According to Hougan, that potential for growth could render DeFi tokens and other non-blue chip assets well-suited for inclusion in ETF wrappers in the future. Increasing access to crypto-based ETFs Although Bitwise is hardly “throwing spaghetti against the wall” when it picks assets to include in its funds, Hougan noted that Bitwise and other issuers aims to file for new ETFs often. “In ETF land, not in crypto land, this is normal,” Hougan said. “ETF issuers file for a lot of ETFs all the time. Although Hougan declined to specify which assets Bitwise's future funds could track, he said the firm is looking at tokens linked to “high quality” and “interesting” projects with “real potential” to track in single-asset ETFs. The asset manager also listens to its clients when deciding which assets it should offer in ETF wrappers. The firm’s idea, he said, is to give its clients ample options for where to put their money. “I don't want to be paternalistic about what they should access,” Hougan said. The executive said it’s reasonable for issuers to provide clients exposure to all kinds of assets—even those they might not highly recommend—as long as those assets aren’t linked to rug pulls or scams. “Blackrock offers a lot of bond funds, but I wouldn't buy a 30-year Treasury fund if you held a gun to my head,” Hougan said. He added, “I'm not going to tell anyone to invest in Doge, but I could tell someone if you're going to invest in Doge, it's probably cheaper to do in the ETF, and there's probably less risk.” Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: MakerDAO’s Spark to invest $500 million in BlackRock’s BUIDL fund

The Tokenization Grand Prix aims to diversify Spark's stablecoin reserves by investing $1 billion in tokenized funds. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spark has announced that BlackRock, Superstate, and Centrifuge are the winners of its Tokenization Grand Prix. The goal is to allocate $1 billion in tokenized assets, with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund set to receive half of it. The competition, launched in July 2024, allocated funds through the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL). The initiative aimed to integrate real-world assets (RWAs) to diversify Spark’s balance sheet while expanding stablecoin adoption in DeFi. The final allocation remains subject to Sky (formerly MakerDAO) governance approval, with a vote scheduled for April 3. If approved, the initiative will also invest $300 million in Superstate’s USTB and $200 million in Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY. Currently, the Spark Liquidity Layer holds USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. The protocol will use these stablecoins to add BUIDL, USTB, and JTRSY. The competition attracted 39 applications, reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm specializing in RWAs within the Spark ecosystem. Applicants were assessed based on pricing transparency, liquidity levels, and strategic alignment with Spark’s objectives. Spark picked each of these RWA tokens backed by US Treasury securities, suggesting a preference for liquid and conservative assets. BUIDL is offered by BlackRock and tokenized by Securitize. The money fund invests in US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and cash. BUIDL is the largest tokenized money fund, with over $1.2 billion in market cap as of March 18. Spark’s incoming investment could propel it close to $2 billion. Meanwhile, Superstate’s USTB focuses on short-duration US Treasury bills maturing in six months or less, ensuring a predictable and secure yield. It is significantly smaller than BUIDL, with $370 million participation in the market. Lastly, Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY allocates money to a short-duration US Treasury fund that reinvests in new issuances as existing securities mature. With a market cap of $32.4 million, JTRSY is also the smallest of the three tokenized funds potentially to receive Spark’s investment. If approved, Spark’s investments in BlackRock/Securitize, Superstate, and Centrifuge will mark a significant step in integrating tokenized RWAs into DeFi infrastructure.

Title: Breaking Down Strategy’s Recent Preferred Stock Offerings

ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo , Contributor. Strategy, the rebranded MicroStrategy and the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, made headlines earlier today as it unveiled its latest preferred stock offering, STRF. The company launched a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of its Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (ticker: STRF), subject to market conditions. The new offering aims to raise capital for general corporate purposes, with a significant portion earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions and working capital. The new STRF offering introduces a hybrid security designed to appeal to investors seeking lower volatility compared to Strategy’s volatile common stock (MSTR). The STRF shares will be sold at market price. Strategy offers a liquidation price of $100/share. The liquidation price offered by the company is the amount per share that preferred shareholders are entitled to receive in the event of the company’s liquidation or dissolution, after satisfying debts but before distributing anything to common shareholders. It represents the preferred stock’s claim on assets. The STRF stock’s dividends compound at an initial rate of 10% annually plus 1% for unpaid amounts, escalating by 1% per period up to a maximum of 18% per annum until settled. The dividend is payable quarterly in arrears starting June 30, 2025, if declared by Strategy’s board of directors. Assuming the full offering is executed as planned, the company would take on a potential $50,000,000 annual dividend obligation. This is Strategy’s second preferred offering that offers a dividend. Earlier this year the company issued 7.3 Million of Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, STRK, offering a fixed annual dividend of 8%. This issuance netted the company $563.4 million in proceeds and represents a potential total annual dividend obligation of approximately $58,400,000. Strategy’s potential cumulative annual dividend obligation from the STRK and STRF offerings, if both are fully executed as outlined, is approximately $108.4 million ($58.4 million for STRK and $50 million for STRF). This figure assumes full issuance and declared dividends. Actual payments depend on board decisions and financial health, making the obligation conditional rather than fixed. The actual dividend amount to be paid may also be higher if dividends go unpaid and triggers rates to escalate from the initial 10%. The nature of these instruments has sparked a debate online regarding Strategy’s ability to pay the dividends, methods through which it could do so, and what happens if the company doesn’t generate the necessary cash to pay down the preferred stock dividends offered. First, it’s important to note that, based on the offering details, Strategy has no obligation to issue or pay the dividends. They are all subject to board approval. While it is an option available to the company, not declaring or paying the dividends could impact the share prices significantly. Second, we can contrast the potential dividend obligations with the company’s operating cashflows from its software business. Strategy’s Q4 2024 earnings report notes $126.6 million in total revenue for the year, but this likely includes some Bitcoin-related adjustments post-adoption of FASB ASU 2023-08 (effective January 1, 2025), which mandates fair value accounting for Bitcoin. Excluding Bitcoin gains, the software business’s contribution to cash flow is likely in the range of $100–150 million annually, based on historical adjusted EBITDA figures. For further context, these were $80-$100 million in 2022-2023, per earlier filings. If we assume that Strategy’s software business is generating ~$100-$150 million in operational cash flow contributions, the fact that they have just taken on a potential $108.4 million dividend commitment has prompted some investors to ask “what happens if they need to come up with more cash to pay the dividend?”. The answer is that a) the company is not obligated to declare or pay the dividends and b) it could resort to issuing more common shares or selling bitcoin to raise the cash it needs to pay the dividends. Since Strategy’s first preferred offering, STRK, started trading on February 1st 2025, the stock is up +6%. In that same period, Strategy’s common stock, MSTR, has traded down -16.44%, signalling that investors like the potential yield and protection that the preferred offering provides. Importantly, Strategy’s common shares and preferred shares have both outperformed bitcoin and the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) since February 1st 2025, with spot bitcoin and IBIT being down -19% in the same period.

Title: Hong Kong’s leader takes swipe at Trump but avoids criticism of deal to sell Panama assets

Kanis Leung, Associated Press Kanis Leung, Associated Press Leave your feedback HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center’s business leaders trapped in the middle. Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings’ in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were. “(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” he said. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing’s family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate. His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing. Since last Thursday, Beijing’s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale. One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy. The articles signaled Beijing’s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear. Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would “reclaim” the Panama Canal. Panama President José Raúl Mulino accused him of lying. Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong’s laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating. Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee’s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference. In Beijing, when asked about reports that China authorities are investigating the potential sale, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said reporters should ask other Chinese authorities. WATCH: ‘We’re taking’ back the Panama Canal, Trump says “I would like to stress that in principle, China has been firmly opposing infringing on or undermining other countries’ legitimate rights and interests with economic coercion and bullying,” she said. The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports. The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction requires approval by Panama’s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China. Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison’s operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal, it says. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.

Title: China, Hong Kong threaten to thwart sale of Panama Canal ports to America's BlackRock

Gordon Chang, expert on U.S.-China relations, details how Beijing can 'make life very difficult' for firms involved in sale of Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock. A deal for the U.S. to "reclaim" the Panama Canal is increasingly under fire from authorities in China and Hong Kong. Earlier this month, BlackRock announced a $23 billion deal with CK Hutchinson to take ownership of the Panamanian ports of Cristobal and Balboa, which are located at the Atlantic and Pacific ends of the canal, respectively. It would also take over Hutchinson’s controlling interest in 43 ports in 23 other countries. However, Hong Kong and Chinese leaders could seek to stand in the way. John Lee, the leader of Hong Kong, stated his concerns about the deal on Tuesday, saying it deserved "serious attention." The agreement between the two conglomerates was seen as a solution to President Donald Trump’s threats to take back the canal after he argued that China was using it to "rip off" U.S. ships through entry fees. DEM SEEKS TO HALT TRUMP FROM 'INVADING' GREENLAND, CANADA AND PANAMA CK Hutchison and BlackRock recently inked a deal to transfer ownership of the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo) Trump touted the BlackRock deal as the U.S. "reclaiming" the port when it was first announced. Now, Beijing has opened up investigations into potential antitrust and national security concerns about the deal through various agencies, including its State Administration of Market Regulation, Bloomberg reported. "If Beijing stops this deal, that’s a direct challenge to the president of the United States on an issue which he really cares about," said U.S.-China relations expert Gordon Chang. "That is not going to go down very well." The lucrative waterway sees 5% of global maritime trade pass through. CK Hutchison’s stock price fell 3% on Tuesday after Lee’s comments, and the company canceled press and investor briefings that were scheduled for this week when it releases its financial report. CHINA SLAMS TRUMP-IMPOSED ‘ARBITRARY TARIFFS,’ VOWS RETALIATION AGAINST US Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said the Panama deal "deserved serious attention." (REUTERS/Joyce Zhou) "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations," Lee had said in an apparent jab at Trump. Commentaries published in Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper owned by the Chinese government, claimed the Hutchison-BlackRock agreement would allow the U.S. to "use [the canal] for political purposes and promote its own political agenda" and would make Chinese trade and shipping "subject to the United States." CK Hutchison is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Lee has said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong law, and the city will handle the deal according to law. "I suspect that the Hong Kong government is not going to take on Li Ka Shing and Hutchison, but you never know because the environment in Hong Kong is changing. It's not getting better," said Chang. PANAMA PLEDGES TO END KEY CANAL DEAL WITH CHINA, WORK WITH US AFTER RUBIO VISIT Some 5% of global maritime trade passes through the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) China’s presence in the canal zone allows it to block U.S. access at will. That could mean in the outbreak of war in the Indo-Pacific, it could prevent the U.S. Navy from surging ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the canal. However, the canal could also be used as leverage for China in its push for Trump to alleviate tariffs. Trump said Monday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be visiting the U.S. in the "not too distant future." Trump at first put a blanket 10% tariff on all Chinese goods. In March, he upped it to 20%, arguing China was still not doing enough to address fentanyl flowing from its country through U.S. borders. CK Hutchison’s ownership of the canal also faces a constitutional challenge in Panama, which could be a factor in its intent to sell. Panamanian Attorney General Kenia Isolda Porcell Díaz has filed a submission in support of two lawsuits against renewal of a 25-year contract for Hutchison to own the ports, arguing the contract is "unconstitutional" because it "improperly agree[s] to transfer exclusive rights of the Panamanian State." When asked about the reports that China was investigating the sale, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the questions should be directed at other agencies.

Title: JD Vance: Cheap Labor Is Bad for U.S. Productivity, Innovation, Society

The lure of cheap labor is bad for innovation, productivity, civic solidarity, and national strength, Vice President JD Vance told business leaders at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vance told his audience of investors, adding: Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. “Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor,” Vance said in a short speech. The statement shows how Vance is trying to repair the political bridge between the party’s voters and business leaders that was deliberately demolished by ruthless pro-migration policies pushed by the two Bush presidencies. The two Bush presidencies dramatically expanded legal and illegal migration to inflate the stock market with cheap labor, more consumers, and more renters. “There were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization,” Vance said: The first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the design of things. The idea was that rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things. You would open an iPhone box and it would say “Designed in Cupertino, California.” Now the implication, of course, is that it would be manufactured [in China] or somewhere else. And yeah, some people might lose their jobs in manufacturing, and they could learn to design, or to use a very popular phrase, and “learn to code.” But I think we got it wrong. Turns out that the geographies that do the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things. There are network effects, as you all well understand, the firms that design products work with firms that manufacture. They share intellectual property, they share best practices, and they even sometimes share critical employees. Now we assume that other nations would always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end [so] we were squeezed from both ends. Now that was the first conceit of globalization. I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it’s a crutch that inhibits innovation. I might even say that it’s a drug that too many American firms got addicted to. Now, if you can make a product more cheaply, it’s far too easy to do that rather than to innovate. And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. Now, one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate. So a higher wage at McDonald’s means more [service] kiosks. And whatever your views on the wisdom of the minimum wage, I’m not going to comment on that here … [we think] companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing. I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and cheaper labor. You’re worried about innovating, about building new things, about the old formulation of technology is doing more with less. You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day. And so I’d ask my friends, both on the tech optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation. Indeed, I’d say that globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation. Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. … Our goal is to incentivize investment in our own borders — in our own businesses, our own workers, and our own innovation. We don’t want people seeking cheap labor. We want them investing and building right here in the United States of America. Breitbart News has posted many articles about migration’s harmful impact on productivity and innovation, and how tight labor markets and rising wages pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity. For example, the Fortune 500 has increasingly imported foreign white-collar labor to cut costs. But the programs created by Congress and the executive — such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs — have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing. The damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers. In 2024, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that President Joe Biden’s migration policy would reduce productivity growth in the United States. Vance told his listeners that elites’ demand for cheap labor also fractures societies: I think the populists, when they look at the future, and when they compare it to what’s happened in the past, I think a lot of them see alienation of workers from their jobs, from their communities, from their sense of solidarity. You see the alienation of people from their sense of purpose. And importantly, they see a leadership class that believes welfare can replace a job and an application on a phone can replace a sense of purpose. … Now, I remember a Silicon Valley dinner in particular, back when I was in — in my tech days, where my wife and I were sitting around talking to some of the leaders of — of the important technology firms of the United States … And I remember one of the tech CEOs who was there that — you know, CEO — you would know his name if I mentioned it. He was the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. He said, “Well, I’m actually not worried about the loss of purpose when people lose their jobs.” And I said, “Okay, well, what do you think is going to replace that sense of purpose?” And he said, “Digital, fully immersive gaming.” The same economic and civic problem has occurred in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where national leaders are inflating the economy with immigrants, dragging down average income and prosperity. For example, immigration forces nations to divert investment to housing and consumerism and away from factory automation and high-tech research. The economic damage has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart
