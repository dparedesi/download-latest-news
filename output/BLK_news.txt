Despite having pledged to reach net-zero emissions, major members of Net Zero Asset Managers hold billions of dollars' worth of fossil-fuel stocks, including those in “carbon bomb” projects, while marketing their funds as green and sustainable. Select a language Fact check: In December 2020, a group of big players in international finance launched the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. They committed their firms to “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”. They planned to do this by directing investments toward sustainable businesses that are helping to cut the emissions responsible for the climate crisis. Context: Article 2c of the Paris Climate Agreement called for financial flows to be consistent with “a pathway towards greenhouse gas-emission-resilient development". Over 230 global banks and asset-management firms subsequently signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, launched in 2020 with the aim of “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier”. Alas, those firms’ investments tell a different story. Launched in 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative committed its members to “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”. Over 230 firms signed up to it, including European ones such as Germany's DWS, the Netherlands' Robeco, France's AXA, and Italy's Eurizon. Some of these we have covered in previous reporting due to their ostensibly “green” investments in the fossil-fuel industry. NZAM carried the institutional imprimatur of the United Nations, in the form of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. UN PRI signatories commit, among other objectives, to incorporating “ESG [environmental, social and governance] issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes”. Specific ESG criteria are used to assess the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment. Net Zero Asset Managers has received significant media coverage, giving the impression that it is a force for change. In November 2022, for instance, the specialist magazine ESG Today headlined, “Net Zero Asset Managers reaches $66 trillion in assets under management”. The article explained that the signatories were committed to “progressively transforming their investment portfolios to align them with the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050". NZAM was covered on the UN's website in an April 2021 article titled “Biggest financial players back net zero”. NZAM's media profile has allowed its signatories to flaunt their commitment to the Paris climate accord and to market themselves as being mindful of sustainability. Yet our research shows that, at the high point of NZAM's activity in the last quarter of 2023, its members held the equivalent of $25 billion in fossil-fuel stocks in their “green” investment portfolios. Moreover, that sum included companies responsible for so-called “carbon bombs”, a term coined in 2022 by Kjell Kuhne, a campaigner at Leave it in the Ground (Lingo), to refer to hydrocarbons projects that generate more than one gigatonne of CO₂ over their lifetime. Specialists say that this type of project needs to be shuttered as quickly as possible if the Paris Agreement timetable is to be kept. Using data from the London Stock Exchange Data & Analytics, we identified funds classified as “green” under the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), in force since 2021. Articles 8 and 9 of the regulation govern the requirements to be met for marketing products as, respectively, having “environmental or social” objectives or being “sustainable investments”. The NZAM signatories that are most exposed to hydrocarbons accounted for 54 percent of all NZAM investments in this sector. They include DWS (a German firm), JP Morgan, BlackRock, Northern Trust and AllianceBernstein (all American), France's Amundi, the Netherlands' Robeco, Norway's Storebrand and Italy's Eurizon. Together they held a stake of just over $14 billion in the oil and gas industry. In 2023, many of these companies used terms such as “sustainability” and “innovation” to describe funds that held stakes in well-known oil giants. For example, the US firm State Street employed the words “Sustainable Climate” to market a fund that held a $7 million share in Exxon. Another fund, “Europe Climate Action”, marketed by Amundi, held $18 million of stakes in Aker, BP, Equinor, and TotalEnergies. In the past year, new guidelines have set clear limits on the use of sustainability-related words in the names of funds that invest in fossil fuels. However, as we showed in previous articles in this series, numerous asset managers continue to invest in dirty hydrocarbons while declaring their support for sustainability and ESG in their prospectuses to investors. Overall, of the ten NZAM members that have made the largest share of “green” investments, the stakes involved total $18 billion. They include 82 extraction projects defined as “carbon bombs” by Kjell Kuhne of Lingo. According to Kuhne, “the amount of emissions generated [by carbon bombs] is greater than that emitted in a year by the whole of Germany, a highly industrialized country that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels”. The investments made by the Net Zero Asset Managers have clearly not helped to convince their Big Oil beneficiaries to put a stop to these 82 “carbon bombs”. This despite the claim often made by asset managers that they can push the industry towards transition by means of their participation in company meetings and the votes they cast there. Furthermore, all ten firms mentioned are also signatories to the UN's Principles for Responsible Investment, despite continuing to invest in fossil fuels. In a report published in November 2024, the UN PRI Association writes that policymakers should instruct financial firms to implement “robust carbon pricing and market-based mechanisms, accelerating the full and equitable phase out of fossil-fuel subsidies and establishing clear plans and targets for phasing out unabated fossil fuels in line with credible 1.5°C pathways”. Kuhne, of Leave it in the Ground, is acerbic: ”These companies are actively creating these new CO2 bombs. When the climate is already in danger and spiraling out of control, not creating new carbon bombs should be the top priority." “A green investment should not provide any money to companies involved in the fossil-fuel supply chain“, he concludes. ”It should be ‘fossil-free’, and for me this is a fundamental criterion for being able to call oneself green, sustainable, and climate-friendly. Today, these companies are the biggest obstacle to progress towards sustainability. If you were selling a green fund while investing in Exxon, you were simply deceiving your customers."

Title: Private Equity In Your 401(k)? What Trump’s Order Opens—And Doesn’t
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/08/21/private-equity-in-your-401k-what-trumps-order-opens-and-doesnt/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T07:15:00Z

ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” directing the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explore ways to include private market investments and crypto in retirement plans. The order argues that American workers should have access to the same alternative investment opportunities long available to institutions and the wealthy. What what does this all mean for holding private equity in your 401(k)? With its bold framing, the order has already prompted some regulatory policy shifts. The SEC was asked to revisit accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules that currently limit retail participation. And indeed, earlier this week, the SEC issued guidance in ADI 2025-16 ending the 15% private investment limit in registered closed-end funds and related practices in place since 2002. The DOL, meanwhile, must reconsider past guidance on fiduciary duties under ERISA, including whether to establish safe harbors for fiduciaries who add private assets to 401(k) menus. The private equity (PE) industry has been preparing for this opening. With more than $12 trillion in defined-contribution retirement accounts, the 401(k) market is an enormous opportunity. And Trump’s executive order comes at a moment when private capital firms face a liquidity crunch: since 2018, capital calls have outpaced distributions by $1.5 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley. That imbalance is pushing managers to look toward retail dollars. Still, access is not the same as advantage. Ludovic Phalippou, professor at Oxford’s Said Business School, warns that private equity’s favored performance metric—the internal rate of return (IRR)—is a “mathematical artifact” that flatters results. If IRR claims were taken literally, he notes, modest 1970s funds would today be worth trillions—numbers that defy reality. Even when presented cleanly, PE performance may be more incremental than transformational. Of course, the time period of observation is key. Hamilton Lane, a leading private markets investor, calculates that $1 invested in private equity over the past decade would now be worth $3.96. That solid return edges out the S&P 500 ($3.51). Yet the gains come with trade-offs—illiquidity, opaque valuations, and higher fees—that can matter more to individuals than to large institutions. Diversification claims also deserve a second look. Private equity is still equity. While PE managers stress operational improvements and active ownership, today’s higher interest rates and thinner IPO pipelines expose the limits of the model. The easy returns of the 2010s may not repeat. Another hurdle lies in fiduciary duty. ERISA requires plan sponsors to act solely in the interests of participants, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits if high-fee, illiquid assets are added without clear justification. This litigation risk has kept most fiduciaries away from alternatives. As the Financial Times reported, firms like Apollo and BlackRock lobbied aggressively for the order, but ultimately the DOL—and the courts—will decide whether these products can withstand scrutiny. So the question lingers: will PE firms offer some of their best opportunities to retail investors—or their leftovers? Some skepticism is warranted, but there are already signs of good faith. Take KKR. The firm recently renegotiated terms with some institutional investors, increasing the carve-out share from the traditional 7.5% to as much as 20%. The change helps KKR deploy the increasing amounts of cash they are raising from individuals in perpetual vehicles. While controversial, the shift shows a willingness to integrate retail investors on a more equity footing. Even with such examples, executive action alone won’t deliver democratization. Regulators must craft rules that are protective yet practical--safe harbors for fiduciaries, updated investor eligibility standards, and far greater transparency on fees and liquidity. Private equity now faces a crossroads. It can broaden access responsibly, building trust with retail investors, or reinforce perceptions that it serves others first. For 401(k) plan sponsors and participants, the prudent course is cautious engagement—welcoming innovation in expansion of access to private markets while maintaining investor protections through disclosure and oversight. Access, after all, is not alignment. Done thoughtfully, private equity investment in 401(k)s provides broader investment solutions for retirement savers. Done poorly, it risks harming individuals and eroding confidence in the retirement system itself.

Title: Investing Questions

Time Published: 2025-08-21T06:30:36Z

In This Show: “I would love to get a rundown on the financial details in a stock quote. I agree with your preachings against picking and owning individual stocks, whoever chump's going to chump. And one of those chumps is my wife who recently enthusiastically brought me the quote on her latest stock interest. The reason she was so excited was that the price per share was $5, which she considers a steal. I tried to explain that the price per share is meaningless without considering the underlying value per share, but she wasn't having it. Just like with free handbags, she believes that the price is the value. That got me thinking that a rundown on the significance of price per share may be beneficial.” Publicly owned companies exist because, at some point, the original owners wanted to trade ownership for cash. Instead of selling the business to one buyer, which can be difficult for very large or valuable companies, they sell shares to the public through a process called going public. Once a company is listed on the stock market, the value of the company is determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the price per share. That number is called the market capitalization. For example, Tesla’s market cap has been close to a trillion dollars, making it a large-cap company. The stock price itself moves constantly as investors reassess what they think the company is worth, sometimes changing by several percentage points in a single day. Looking more closely at Tesla, you can see how this plays out in real time. The share price can swing dramatically in a year, from a peak of $428 down to around $308, a drop of over 25%. Tesla’s price-to-earnings ratio is especially high at around 179, which means investors are paying $179 for each dollar of earnings. This only makes sense if investors believe the company’s profits will grow much faster than average. The lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio or price-to-book ratio are more important than the stock price itself. A $5 stock is not inherently cheaper than a $100 stock, because the number of shares can be adjusted through stock splits, and the underlying value of the company remains unchanged. The same principles apply to funds and ETFs. For instance, VTI, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, may trade at a price per share similar to Tesla, but its true scale comes from the total assets it manages—which are nearly $2 trillion. Online charts provide a quick snapshot of performance, but deeper analysis often requires resources like Morningstar, where you can examine holdings, turnover, and valuation details. For VTI, about 32% of the fund is concentrated in the top 10 companies like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple, which shows how heavily weighted the US market is toward a few large growth firms. Over time, the balance between large growth and small value stocks tends to shift, and many investors expect that pendulum to eventually swing again. Ultimately, the main point is that stock prices alone are meaningless. What matters are valuations, fundamentals, and the overall structure of the investments you hold.

I have a question about investing in bonds. I am in agreement with the three-fund portfolio investment philosophy. With that in mind, I already have VTI and VXUS in my investment portfolio. And I've never actually had bonds before. I want to introduce them. I was wondering how I should do this. Some background, I am 50 years old, primary care internal medicine doctor. I have a small amount of student loans—about $30,000 at 2.75%—and a mortgage about $200,000 for my home at 2.75% also. I don't have a lot of space in my tax-protected account because I've been doing the Backdoor Roth IRAs and I don't have a traditional IRA. My question is, since I need to invest in taxable accounts in my brokerage account at Vanguard, how should I go about doing this? I am in agreement with your recommendations to do 50% in tax-protected bonds and 50% in inflation-protected bonds. The question is which bond ETF or mutual funds should I choose for my taxable brokerage account at Vanguard? Like I said, I do live in Florida, so I don't have state taxes. But I do want to avoid federal income taxes.” The three-fund portfolio is a simple and popular investing approach that combines a total US stock market index, a total international stock market index, and a total bond market index. The idea is to keep things straightforward while still achieving broad diversification across stocks and bonds. It is easy to implement in almost any type of account—from 401(k)s to HSAs—and the funds are widely available at very low cost from providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. This portfolio appeals to many because it is cheap and diversified, and it requires little maintenance. The key to success, however, is not picking the perfect portfolio but choosing a reasonable one, funding it consistently, and sticking with it for the long run. When thinking about asset location, tax efficiency becomes important. Bonds are generally less tax-efficient than stocks because their returns are taxed as ordinary income every year. That is why many investors try to keep their bond holdings in tax-protected accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s. If you need to place something in taxable accounts, US total stock market funds are often the best choice. They are relatively tax-efficient, with low yields and a high percentage of qualified dividends, which means less of the return is taxed each year and at lower rates. In fact, more than 95% of dividends from the total stock market fund are typically qualified. For those with very large taxable accounts or limited room in tax-protected accounts, sometimes bonds must be held in taxable accounts. In that case, municipal bonds can be a smart choice, particularly for high-income investors. The interest from municipal bonds is exempt from federal taxes, and if you buy bonds specific to your state, they may also be free from state taxes. In states with no income tax, like Florida, a general municipal bond fund works well. Investors who want inflation protection may also consider adding Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), though these are best held in tax-protected accounts due to their complex tax treatment. Ultimately, the three-fund portfolio works well for many, but it can be adjusted with municipal bonds or TIPS to better fit an investor’s tax situation and income level. The important lesson is to focus less on finding the one perfect portfolio and more on choosing something reasonable, keeping costs low, and staying disciplined over time. More information here: Investing in Bonds – Back to Basics In Defense of Bonds “Hello, Jim, this is Ash from Virginia. I was speaking with my financial advisor recently, and he recommended that I invest in private equity as a way to diversify and reduce market correlation. Otherwise, I am heavily invested in Vanguard index funds. I was wondering if you thought this was a good idea, neutral, or a bad idea. “ Private equity is a very broad term that simply refers to any business that is not publicly traded on the stock market. That could mean everything from a local, small business to large private corporations or real estate held on the equity side rather than the debt side. While the phrase often gets used as if it refers to a specific sophisticated investment type, it really encompasses a wide range of possibilities. The key difference between private and public markets is that public markets offer liquidity, transparency, and daily pricing, while private markets can avoid those pressures but lack the same ease of access and regulation. Even public companies sometimes go private to escape the demands of constant market scrutiny. Private equity can be structured in many ways, including funds that buy businesses using leverage with the intent to resell them later at a profit. However, this approach often leads to aggressive cost-cutting that harms operations, as seen in some physician groups and hospitals where services decline while profits are extracted. Investors considering private equity need to understand these tradeoffs. Unlike public investments, private equity lacks liquidity, meaning money may be tied up for years, and outcomes can vary widely depending on management and strategy. At the same time, there is growing interest in private equity from major players like Vanguard, which has partnered with BlackRock to explore offering these opportunities more broadly. The promise is that private equity could enhance returns or provide diversification, though whether that proves true remains to be seen. Investors should approach private markets carefully. Legally, many private equity investments are limited to accredited investors, which by rule means earning at least $200,000 annually or having $1 million in investable assets. Yet beyond those benchmarks, the real requirement should be the ability to evaluate the investment independently and the financial strength to withstand a complete loss without serious consequences. Even for those who qualify, diversification remains essential. Only a portion of a portfolio should be illiquid, and every investment should be weighed on its own merits. Investing success comes from building a reasonable, diversified portfolio and sticking with it over time, not chasing every new opportunity. Private equity may or may not deserve a place in your portfolio, but it is not essential for financial success. Staying disciplined, balancing fear of missing out against the risks of loss, and keeping long-term goals in focus are what ultimately lead to financial security.

Finance 101: Sequence of Returns Risk Sequence of returns risk, or SORR, is the danger that retirees can run out of money even if their portfolio earns strong average returns over time. The problem arises when poor investment returns occur early in retirement while withdrawals are high. When account balances are shrinking and withdrawals continue, the portfolio becomes more vulnerable to being depleted. This issue is especially concerning for those entering retirement during an economic downturn, a prolonged recession, or a period of high inflation, making it an important risk to plan for in a financial strategy. There are several ways to reduce this risk. Retiring with a large portfolio relative to expenses is one solution because a low withdrawal rate of 1%-3% makes portfolios very resilient. Others can choose to work longer, which both shortens the retirement horizon and reduces dependence on early withdrawals. Delaying Social Security benefits and using guaranteed income sources, such as pensions or annuities, also provide stability, ensuring essential expenses are covered regardless of market performance. These strategies can dramatically reduce the impact of poor early returns. Portfolio design also plays a key role in managing sequence of returns risk. Investors can prepare by holding assets that protect against inflation, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), real estate, and equities. Many retirees also adopt strategies like maintaining a “bond tent” with more bonds in the years around retirement or creating a TIPS ladder to fund the first several years of spending. Others rely on the bucket approach, keeping some cash for short-term needs and replenishing it only during good market years. Flexible withdrawal methods, such as guardrail strategies, allow spending to adjust depending on returns, though in bad markets spending may need to be cut significantly. A thoughtful plan that considers these tools can help retirees avoid running out of money even when early returns are unfavorable.

All right, welcome back to the podcast. It's summer. That means we're all trying to take time off around here at White Coat Investor. It's amazing to look at the weeks and see how many of our staff are gone in any given week. But that means when we're together, we wedge everything in and try to get the work done. Unfortunately, that's the way emergency medicine works too. And I've apparently taken too much time off in this month. And so, here I find myself this week working seven days straight. Now, it's not unusual for docs. I know docs do that all the time, but for me, it's a little unusual. I only work six shifts a month and I've got five of them this week between shifts for July at the end of July and shifts for August at the beginning of August. You can tell I'm recording this on the last day of July. And then, of course, the other two days in the week are chock full of WCI stuff. So I'm feeling a little crispy right now, not going to lie, but I'm going to spend all next week backpacking. So, should be okay. Looking forward to going to the Uinta Mountains with some young men from our church group. So it should be a lot of fun. RUNDOWN ON FINANCIAL DETAILS OF A STOCK QUOTE All right, let's get into your questions today. We've got a lot of great questions to talk about today. The first one comes in from somebody who sent me an email. Said, “I have a suggestion for a blog post.” And I said, sounds better to cover on the podcast. Said, “A rundown on the financial details in a stock quote. I agree with your preachings against picking and owning individual stocks, whoever chumps going to chump. And one of those chumps is my wife who recently enthusiastically brought me the quote on her latest stock interest. The reason she was so excited was that the price per share was $5, which she considers a steal. I tried to explain that the price per share is meaningless without considering the underlying value per share, but she wasn't having it. Just like with free handbags, she believes that the price is the value. That got me thinking that a rundown on the stock fund, ETF, et cetera, quote items, especially the significance of price per share may be beneficial.” Okay. Well, let's talk about this. First of all, the reason there are publicly owned companies is that once people owned a company and decided they didn't want to own it anymore, they would rather have cash than own the company. So they sold it. Sometimes you feel like you can get a better price by selling it to everybody than by selling it to just one person or one company. And especially if it's a particularly valuable company, you can't find any one person to buy it. You have to go sell it to everybody. And that's called going public. That's when a stock becomes a stock, when it gets on the stock market. It goes from being a public company or a private company to being a publicly traded company. And in order to do that, you have to try to figure out about what the company's worth. And then once it starts trading on the stock market, everybody, the market gets to decide what the company's worth. And that changes by the second during the day. That's why the price of your stock goes up by 1% or down by 7% in a single day, because the market changes their opinion. As things go along, the market is all of us weighing in on what the opinion is. The way you determine the value of a publicly traded company though, is you count up the number of shares and you multiply that number of shares by the price per share. That's not that hard to do. Basically that information is available for any publicly traded company. So, if we put in Tesla stock into Google, what pops up is Tesla Inc. It says it's traded on the NASDAQ, gives you the ticker TSLA, and tells you what the market cap of the company is. And according to this, it is $967 billion. $967 billion is a market capitalization. That's how much the company is worth. The value of the company at this second is $967 billion, almost a trillion dollars. That makes it a big company. This is a large cap company. There are mid cap companies and there are small cap companies. But when you're worth a trillion dollars, you're considered a large cap company. But if you look at the information available on that, you can see all kinds of things. The most interesting thing that we look at most often is probably the stupid chart that pops up. And you can change that chart. It'll show you how the price has varied over the last day. As I record this, it looks like Tesla's down today. It's gone down from 09:00 A.M. It was $320 a share, and now it's $308 a share. If we lengthen that out and look at the year to date number, we see that Tesla was not an awesome thing to own this year. It peaked in January at $428 a share. And again, today it's $308 a share. So, it's down like over 25%, 26%, 27% this year. Now you understand why I don't talk about politics so much on this podcast. When the CEO of Tesla gets involved in politics, his company becomes worth a lot less. Lesson learned there, I suppose. This also tells you the high and low prices for this stock during the day. It's been anywhere from $306 a share to $321 a share. It will tell you the price to earnings ratio, the PE ratio, basically how much you're paying per dollar of earnings. And it's pretty ridiculous for Tesla. According to this, it's $179 for a dollar of earnings. The PE ratio is 179. Pretty impressive that people would be willing to pay that much for this company. Basically what that says, when you're willing to pay that much for a dollar of earnings, you're saying, I think the earnings are going to grow, and I think they're going to grow faster than the typical company. That's why you're willing to pay 40 or 50 or 100 or 200 times earnings, because you think the earnings are going to grow. Okay, that tells you lots of things about it. But as the emailer notes, the price of the stock doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if there are 10 million shares of the stock and it's worth $100 a share, or if there are 5 million shares of the stock and it's worth $200 a share. It doesn't matter. The company's worth the same. A stock that is $5 is not cheaper than a stock that is $10. It doesn't matter if you buy two shares of the $5 one or one share of the $10 one. Same, same. The way we look at what's cheap are valuation type things, like a price to earnings ratio, a PE ratio, or a price to book ratio. These sorts of things are how you tell which stocks are cheaper, which stocks are more expensive. And sometimes it's okay to buy a more expensive stock. Sometimes it's worth more, but you don't judge that by the share price. You judge that by the PE ratio. The share price is irrelevant. I guess if you're so poor that you can only buy one share of stock and Tesla's $308 and you don't have $308, so you got to buy something else. Well, I guess that's a concern. But for most of us, you can buy any stock you want. That's not going to be a problem. You're going to be buying multiple shares of those stocks if you're buying stocks. So the share price is really pretty much irrelevant. Don't get too hung up on that. All right, if we put in a mutual fund or an ETF, let's put in VTI. This is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF share class. This is a big piece of our portfolio, about 25% of our portfolio is invested in this or something very similar to it we tax loss harvest to. You can see that the share price is $310, about the same as the price of Tesla stocks. So, it asks if that is worth more or less. Now, this is interesting. I look at the market cap on this and it says 254 billion. I'm not sure that's right. Maybe that's right just for the ETF share class. But if I go to Vanguard's site, I'm pretty sure there's a lot more money in the Total Stock Market Index Fund than just a quarter trillion dollars. Let's see what the actual website says here. Portfolio composition, number of stocks, median market cap of those stocks, the earnings growth rate, and maybe that's what they're reporting. Maybe what this fund is reporting is the median market cap for those rather than how much is actually in the fund. The fund's net assets as of the end of June was $1.9 trillion. So that's not what the ticker is reporting when you put that into Google. It must be the median market cap that it's recording. The median market cap of the stocks in the fund or the average market cap, I'm not sure it's even the median. Lots of interesting information there. But mainly when you're looking at these things online to click on this stuff, you're just looking for a quick read on what is done this year or today or this month or whatever, rather than looking for detailed information. If you want detailed information, I think one of the best places to go is the Morningstar website. All the time I'll type in VTI and Morningstar. If you wanted to learn about Tesla stock, you'd put in Tesla and Morningstar. And that'll give you all kinds of fun detailed information there. Tells you the previous closed price, what it closed at yesterday when the market closed. Tells you the 52-week range of what it's traded between. Apparently it's been as low as $182 a share and as high as $488 a share over the last year. It tells you the bid and the ask price. Because this is a market. The bid price is what people are offering to buy your shares. The ask price is what people are asking if you want to buy shares. And there's a slight difference between them. With a very liquid security like Tesla stock or like VTI ETF, those prices are very close together. But the difference between them is what the market maker gets paid. Because somebody's got to hold onto that thing to take it from the buyer and give it to the seller or take it from the buyer. And that's what they make is the difference between the bid and the ask. And right now that's 4 cents on a share of Tesla. But that really adds up if you're doing it by the millions and millions of shares of stock that are exchanged every day. For Tesla, it says here there's 3.2 billion shares outstanding. The market cap is just under a trillion. It tells you how many shares trade every day. 85 million. That's a lot of shares it's trading around. Of the 323 billion, 85 million of them trade every day. This says the price earnings is $154. Price per sales ratio is 12. It gives you all kinds of information about the stock. And if you do the same thing, if you put in VTI Morningstar, it'll give you all kinds of information about funds and about ETFs. And you can click on a different tab and look at the performance. You can see what's in the portfolio and really figure out what's in there. It'll tell you where the stocks are. Of course, with VTI, they're all in the US. It'll tell you how many there are. There's 3,547 holdings in the fund. 32% of the fund is in the top 10 holdings. Their turnover is 2% per year, which is what you'd expect when they just buy and hold everything. You wouldn't expect a lot turnover there. The biggest stock right now is Microsoft, actually. Microsoft is the biggest stock in the stock market at 6%, 6.19%. NVIDIA is next at 6.13%. Apple is next at 5.13%. And apparently 32% of the US stock market is in the top 10 holdings. That's historically relatively high. It's pretty concentrated at the top. That's because large growth has outperformed small value stocks dramatically over the last 15 years. And in fact, the gap in valuations between those two types of stocks has not been as large as it is now. I don't know if it has ever been as large as it is now. That doesn't tell you that small value is going to outperform anytime soon, but you got to think the pendulum is probably going to swing back at some point. It didn't this year. The international, the US pendulum swung back this year, but the small value to large growth one did not. All right. I think that's enough talk about that subject. But yeah, the stock price doesn't matter. That's not what makes something cheap. It's not a good deal because it's $5 and another stock might be $80. That really doesn't matter. The stock price really doesn't matter at all. In fact, when it becomes inconvenient, they just split the stock. And so, instead of having whatever, 10 million shares at $500, they've now got 20 million shares at $250. And everyone rejoices and bids up the stock because it's split. It's irrelevant. It doesn't matter at all. TRACKING RETURNS Okay. Joe wants to talk about tracking the returns on his portfolio. Let's take a listen. Joe: Hey, Jim, I have a question for you about return tracking and specifically what return you use for your comparators in order to provide a benchmark for your stock portfolio. I do keep an individual stock portfolio as a small portion of my allocation, and I track these dollar-weighted returns, which have actually been quite good in the range of 24% to 25% since 2012. However, I acknowledge that as stocks get what I feel overvalued, I tend to move out of individual stocks in favor of broadly diversified ETFs to try to minimize my individual stock risk as values change. I have been out of the market in terms of individual stocks during some larger downturns, for example, during COVID and during 2022. As such, I'm trying to decide how to best compare my individual stock returns in a dollar-weighted approach, but I find that it's actually quite challenging to do a true dollar weighted adjustment based on when my money flows in and out of individual stocks. I do use VTI as my comparator as I'm trying to base myself against a large cap index, but not sure whether I should be using a dollar weight or a time-weighted tracking return. Thanks. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, let's talk about stock picking, Joe. Long-term White Coat Investors know I'm not a huge fan of stock picking or timing the market, both of which you're doing. You tell me you've been doing this for a long time though, 12 years, something like that, more? I don't remember what year you just said it was that you started, but it's been a long time. And you're telling me you're making 24 or 25%. I assume that's true, that you can actually accurately calculate a return. I'm not 100% sure of that because that's what your question is, is how to actually do this. But if it's true, if you're really making 24 or 25% a year because you're particularly talented and skilled at timing the market and picking stocks, I'm not sure you should just be managing your own money, Joe. There are a lot of people out there trying to do this and not having much success at it. They're certainly not whooping the market by 10% or 15% a year. So if you can truly do this, if you're truly one of those very talented people out there, you should be managing billions of dollars, not your own measly $100,000 or $2 million or however much money you have. So, keep that in mind. If you want to be a stock picker, track your returns, track them rigorously. And if it turns out you're really good at this, maybe you missed your calling. Maybe you shouldn't be in medicine or law or whatever has caused you to listen to the White Coat Investor podcast. Maybe you should be out there managing money. It is no small feat to have those sorts of returns long-term. Let's talk a little bit about how to track your returns. And I find the easiest, most accurate way to do this, maybe it's not the easiest, but it is the most accurate, is to use a spreadsheet. If you use a spreadsheet, whether it's Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you use a function called XIRR. It gives you the internal rate of return of the investment. This is a dollar-weighted return. It's not a time-weighted return. Morningstar will put out these studies every now and then saying that investors in general underperform their funds. They give you the fund's time-weighted return. That's what funds report. And they give you the investor's dollar-weighted return because that's the return that investors get. And because investors chase performance, the dollar-weighted return tends to lag the time-weighted return by several percentage points. You also see that because the market generally goes up over time and investors are, of course, putting money in as time goes along. If some of your money went in in April and some of it went in in October and some of it went in in November this year to that investment, of course, you're going to underperform it if it went up over the whole year. Because the time-weighted return assumes you have the same amount of money in there the whole year and you actually didn't. If you're tracking your own returns, I think you ought to use the dollar-weighted return. And that's what XIRR gives you. You can practice this. And there's a blog post on the website about it. If you Google XIRR or calculate your return on the White Coat Investor website, it will walk you through this process and show you how to do it. But basically there's one column of dates and you have to use the date function. You can't just type in the date. You have to use the date function in the spreadsheet. And then the other column is your cash flows. If you're putting money into the portfolio, it's negative. If you take money out of the portfolio, it's positive. And then you have your starting values, a negative number at the top, your ending values, a positive number for whatever it's worth right now at the bottom, and it gives you the return. That's an annualized return. If you're doing this for a period of time less than a year, it's going to annualize it out. If you made 8% this year and you're only halfway through the year, it's going to tell you 16%. And over a multi-year period, it's going to annualize it, as well. If you tell them it's an eight-year period and it gives you a number, that's going to be a return per year that you're getting. That's what the IRR is, is it's an annualized number, which is the one that matters. That's the way you track your return. Now, if you're trying to figure out how you're doing with your stock portfolio, with your stock picking prowess, all you have to keep track of is when the money goes into the account and when money comes out of the account. You don't have to track every individual stock that you're picking and buying and selling and day trading or whatever. All you have to do is when you take money out of the account. When it sits in cash, well, it's still inside the account, so you don't have to take that out of the account if you're going to measure the return of that account. That's the way I would do it if I were you. And if it turns out you're really as talented as you say you are, you've got to ask yourself, are you lucky or are you good? And if you have a conviction that you're good, you ought to go start raising capital, start investing money for more than just yourself and start running a hedge fund or whatever. Because I know a lot of people that would love to have 25% a year returns. You can own the entire world in like one generation or two generations if you can get 25% returns a year. They're pretty awesome. QUOTE OF THE DAY Our quote of the day today comes from Abraham Lincoln, who said, “You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.” I think there's a lot of wisdom there. INTRODUCING BONDS TO YOUR PORTFOLIO Ricardo has got a question about bonds. Let's take a listen to your question, Ricardo. Ricardo: Hey Jim, it's Ricardo in South Florida. I have a question about investing in bonds. I am in agreement with the three-fund portfolio investment philosophy. With that in mind, I already have VTI and VXUS in my investment portfolio. And I've never actually had bonds before. I want to introduce them. I was wondering how I should do this. Some background, I am 50 years old, primary care internal medicine doctor. I have a small amount of student loans, about $30,000 at 2.75% and a mortgage about $200,000 for my home at 2.75% also. I don't have a lot of space in my tax protected account because I've been doing the backdoor Roth IRAs and I don't have a traditional IRA. My question is, since I need to invest in taxable accounts in my brokerage account at Vanguard, how should I go about doing this? I am in agreement with your recommendations to do 50% in tax protected bonds and 50% in inflation protected bonds. The question is then, which bond ETF or mutual funds should I choose for my taxable brokerage account at Vanguard? Like I said, I do live in Florida, so I don't have state taxes, but I do want to avoid federal income taxes. Thanks for everything you do. And I really appreciate your help. Dr. Jim Dahle: All right. There's a lot in that question, Ricardo. You stuffed a lot into 90 seconds, however long your recording was. Let's talk about the three-fund portfolio for a minute. This was made famous by my friend, Taylor Larimore. He published a book. I think it's called The Boglehead's Guide to the Three-fund portfolio. And I don't know that the Bogleheads ever really sponsored or voted to authorize this book being published. Taylor just published it. And Taylor likes his three-fund portfolio. But the truth is, I don't know that there's any defined three-fund portfolio other than what he said it was in his book. This is a Taylor thing, not even necessarily a Bogleheads thing, but it's become very popular over time. And per Taylor, the fund is a total international stock market index, a total stock market index, US stocks, and the total bond market index. So, it's US bonds, US stocks, and international stocks. That's the three-fund portfolio. And there's lots of Bogleheads that like this. It's relatively easy to implement because there's only three investments, three asset classes. And it's pretty straightforward to do. And it's probably good enough. The truth about portfolios is you just need good enough. You get a portfolio that's good enough, you fund it adequately, and you stick with it long term, it'll probably do you just fine. There are some awesome things about the portfolio. First of all, you can buy these investments at just about any type of brokerage. And most 401(k)s will have something pretty darn similar to these funds. And so, it's relatively easy to implement in all of your accounts. Even if you want to implement it in your HSA and your 529, your Atlas, you can do that because these funds tend to be very, very widely available. They can be very cheap. If you're buying them at Schwab and Vanguard and iShares and Fidelity, you can get these funds very, very cheap, basically free. You can buy all the stocks in the world and all the bonds in the US for less than 10 basis points, which is essentially free. It's free, it's very broadly diversified. And Taylor likes it. And he's 100 years old, 101, 102, whatever he is this year. So why not? But I wouldn't feel like you have to invest in this portfolio. There are lots of reasonable portfolios. All you have to do is pick reasonable, fund it adequately, and stick with it. Those are my thoughts on the three-fund portfolio. This dogmatic approach to it that you see sometimes, particularly on the Bogleheads forum, I'm not a huge fan of. In fact, I once wrote one of my most popular blog posts called 150 Portfolios Better Than Yours. I think I've got 200 portfolios on it now. But the point was that any of these are okay. Don't get too fixated on the 3 Fund portfolio or any other portfolio, really. Okay, assuming you still want the three-fund portfolio after that diatribe, the question is where you should put it. First of all, we got to address something else. The other thing you mentioned was my recommendation of half your bonds in tax-protected bonds and half in inflation-indexed bonds. Number one, I don't have a recommendation about bonds. I don't have a WCI-approved or recommended portfolio. Pick something reasonable, stick with it. My portfolio, half the bonds are nominal and half of them are inflation-indexed, and I think that's a reasonable thing to do. But there's a big wide range of what reasonable is when it comes to bonds in your portfolio. And all you have to do is get in that range, fund it adequately, and stick with it. All right, you want to put your bonds, it sounds like, in taxable. And that's fine. At these interest rates we have these days and the higher interest rates, it often makes sense to have your bonds in a tax-protected account because they're not very tax-efficient investments. The entire return is essentially paid out every year and it's taxed at ordinary income tax rates. So, it's not very tax-efficient investment. A lot of times, unless interest rates are really low, people will try to have it inside tax-protected accounts. Typically when people are having to put something into a taxable portfolio, they're moving the most tax-efficient thing first, which is often something like the Total Stock Market Index Fund. If I had to choose between the Total Stock Market Index Fund, the Total International Stock Market Index Fund, and the Total Bond Index Fund, and I had to move one of them to my taxable account, the first one I'd move would be the Total Stock Market Index Fund because I think it's the most tax-efficient of those three funds. Not nearly all the return is paid out. The yield right now on that is like 1.2%. So if this thing's making 10% a year on average long-term, it's only paying out like one-tenth of that, a little more than one-tenth of that in income a year. So most of the return doesn't get taxed every year. And what is paid out is almost all qualified. I was just looking it up this morning for a blog post I was doing, 97% of the dividends out of the Total Stock Market Index last year that I received were qualified dividends. It's a very, very tax-efficient investment. It's not the most tax-efficient investment, but it's very, very tax-efficient. If you can, most of the time, people try to keep their bonds in their 401(k) or something, and put their stocks, particularly US stocks these days, in their taxable account. But if you have to put bonds in taxable, and our taxable account has gotten so large relative to our tax-protected accounts that we have to invest in bonds in taxable if we want to have bonds. And we do. The bonds we have in our taxable account, for the most part, especially on the nominal side, are municipal bonds. And that's because we're in a high tax bracket. We're in the top tax bracket. And so, if you're in a high tax bracket, you will probably find that your after-tax return from municipal bonds is higher than your after-tax return from a regular bond fund, like total bond market fund, the one in the three-fund portfolio. Keep that in mind. If you're really going to put them in taxable, maybe your three-fund portfolio is the total stock market index fund, the total international stock market index fund, and the municipal bond index fund at Vanguard. I think it's available in an ETF as well if you want that version of it. If you want to have some inflation index bonds in there as well, well, you're talking about a four-fund portfolio. But you could put a bond fund in there that owns TIPS, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, into your taxable account. We do have to do that as well. Like I said, we have a bigger asset location problem than most people do. Certainly, TIPS are one of the last things I would move out of tax-protected accounts. They can be kind of annoying for various reasons. They're a little bit complex as far as how they pay out the return. And particularly if you're buying individual TIPS, you get phantom income. You got to pay taxes on it, but you didn't actually receive the income. So it's definitely better to have in a tax-protected account than most things that you can put into a tax-protected account of some type. I hope that's helpful. But if you're putting bonds in a taxable account and you're listening to the White Coat Investor podcast, there's a good chance those bonds should be municipal bonds. Municipal bonds, the interest they pay out is federal income tax-free. If they are state-specific bonds to your state, they might also be state tax-free. Obviously, in Ricardo's case, he's in Florida, he doesn't have a state tax. He could just use a general municipal bond fund like the excellent ones offered by Vanguard that we use. That's how I would implement a three-fund portfolio. If I had to put the bond in a taxable account and I were in a high income tax bracket, I'd use municipal bonds. Hope that's helpful. All right, if you need some help in getting educated, you need to become more financially literate, you need some help putting your plan together, but you don't want to pay thousands for a financial advisor, we have a course for that. If you want to get into real estate investing, we have a course for that.

Okay, we've talked about bonds, we've talked a little bit about tracking returns, let's talk about gold. Everyone likes to talk about gold, especially when gold has done well more recently, and then of course, you don't hear about it for a decade, because that's the way gold is. It has good returns for a year or two and then nothing for 15 years, and then good returns for a year or two. That's kind of the way gold's been historically. But let's listen to the question, see if we can answer it. IS INVESTING IN GOLD POINTLESS? Speaker: Hi, Dr. Dahle, I'm a radiologist in the Southeast and I have a question about gold. I don't invest in it, but I do see it as an asset class and I hear people going to it as a flight to safety, buying bullion from Costco and things like that. But I'm skeptical that in the times that you would really need gold, that you could get your value for it, that you put in. Even though it's increased in value over time, it seems like the times that people are buying it for would be times that were duress, disasters, and times when these things would be illiquid and you could run the risk of then losing your gains or a lot of your investment, having to sell at a relative loss when you really desperately need the money. I'm curious about the sale component of investing in gold. Thanks. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, those who know about my portfolio know I don't own gold. I don't own silver, I don't own platinum, I don't own precious metals ETFs. I really don't invest in this asset class at all. I've got some gold in my finger. Katie's got a little bit of platinum on her finger. Although when I got her a 25th anniversary ring, we decided to go with white gold rather than platinum, mostly due to my experience of cutting rings off people in the emergency department. It's way easier to cut through gold than any of these other fancy metals, by the way. If I have to go through like three blades in a half hour of trying to get your ring off, you've picked the wrong precious metal. But precious metals as an investment, I'm not a big fan of. And the reason why is because they are a speculative investment. Now by speculative, I don't mean it's risky or it's stupid or something like that. When I say speculative, I mean that it doesn't produce anything. Bonds produce interest. You put your money in your savings account, it pays interest. If you buy a stock, you get the earnings of the stock. If you buy real estate, you earn rents. These are productive assets. Gold is not a productive asset. It is a speculative asset. Other speculative assets include empty land, include Bitcoin and other sorts of crypto assets. Commodities, anything that's not producing something is a speculative asset. Just as a general rule, I don't invest in those. So I don't invest in gold. Now I have to speculate on why some people do. Some people see that gold went up and they want to buy it. There's a lot of people out there that's seriously the way they invest. They own Bitcoin because Bitcoin went up, not because they bothered learning about any sort of blockchain technology or they're into it or they have a deep-felt conviction on the long-term use of Bitcoin as a currency or anything like that. They're like, “Bitcoin go up, must buy Bitcoin.” Same thing with gold. That's why people buy it. My parents, many of you know, I helped take over their portfolio a little over 20 years ago and they're maybe not the most informed investors. Luckily, they haven't had to be for the last 20 years. But at one point when I was a child, I remember there was a bucket of silver coins in my closet. They've subsequently liquidated that, but somebody told them silver was a great investment and silver was going through the roof and so they bought a bucket of them and for some reason hid them in my closet. I don't know how much a bucket of silver coins was worth back then, but this was probably the 80s. So it was probably worth something pretty good. I never was smart enough to grab all the silver and run, but that's how people invest in this stuff. I don't know what they're thinking. Think about the last 100 years. We've had lots of bad economic times happen in the last 100 years. We went through a pandemic when you couldn't even get toilet paper. Interest rates went up 4% or 5% in a single year in 2022. In 2008, the world's financial markets were going to crash. Our real estate went in a hole that it didn't recover from for a decade. We look at 2000. The dot-com crash. We look at the 1970s with stagflation. We look at a day in 1987 when the markets dropped 22% in a single day. We've had World War I and World War II and the Korean War and the Vietnam War and a couple of wars in the Gulf. And we spent 20 years in Afghanistan. Had the Great Depression. We've had multiple depression-like events in the 1800s. All these things that have happened. Now, if we think back to all of those, in which of those times did you take a hunk of gold bullion down to the store and buy your groceries and buy your gasoline and exchange it for something you needed? None of them. This idea that this flight to safety, this asset you can have when times are really bad is a little bit hokey. If you really end up in the zombie apocalypse, nobody's going to want your stupid gold. They want bullets. They want canned goods. Have you guys watched The Walking Dead? Nobody's looking for gold in The Walking Dead. They're looking for someplace safe. They're looking for some weapons. They're looking for some food. They're looking for some gasoline. Those sorts of things. They're not looking for gold. I don't know what your plan is to spend this in a terrible economic downturn. Are you going to slice little bits off it like a little loaf of bread and weigh them on a scale and use that to buy things? What's your plan, really, when it comes to gold? It probably doesn't make any sense to use it in that sort of a thing. Now, I know people escaped Nazi Germany with some gold in their pockets or some jewelry in their pockets or diamonds or something like that. But the truth is, if that's what you need to do, if you need to get value across an international border without getting caught, I think you're much better off with a crypto asset. This is one of the few really great use cases for Bitcoin. I probably wouldn't use gold for that. So if that's what you're buying gold for, probably think about Bitcoin instead. Why do people buy gold? Well, they buy gold because gold went up. And gold's gone up now for the first time in a long time. Just looking at the historical price of gold, if you pull up a chart on Google, I see, okay, this is pretty exciting here. I see in 2015, it was like a little over $1,000 an ounce. And now it is $3,400 an ounce. It's worth three times as much as it was 10 years ago. This is why people are interested in gold. But if you actually go back to some sort of historical numbers, you'll see probably a different scenario. Okay, here's gold price over the last 100 years. It was super high in the 1970s. $2,400 an ounce in like 1978 or something like that. And then it plummeted to $400 an ounce during the tech run-up, the late 1990s. That's kind of what gold does. And now it's back up to $3,500 an ounce or something. But basically, if you look at gold, the price of gold over the last 800 years or so, it basically keeps up with inflation over the long-term, but with dramatically more volatility. 800 years ago, an ounce of gold bought a nice man's suit. And today, an ounce of gold buys a nice man's suit. It keeps up with inflation and that's about it. So that's what I would expect out of gold. I would expect to do nothing for many years, maybe decades, and then have a spectacular two or three or four years, and that to all average out to more or less inflation in the long run. I don't make recommendations on what to have in your portfolio. If you want gold in there, keep it to less than 10% of the portfolio. A single digit kind of number, it's fine. If you want to stick with it for the long run, you say, I'm going to put 5% in gold. I think that's fine. There'll be times when it does well, like the last decade, especially the last few years, there'll be times when it does poorly like the 1990s. But if you're willing to stick with it through thick and thin, you keep it to a small percentage of your portfolio, I think it's fine to have it in your portfolio. I'm not going to put it in mine. Not only does it not produce anything, but it costs something to maintain. You got to pay to store it. You got to pay to protect it and insure it. And I don't know. It's just not a very attractive asset class to me. But if you want it, I think it's fine. I'm going to tell you the same thing about it. I'm going to tell you about Bitcoin. Single digit percentage of your portfolio. And if it does really well over a few years, don't let it start dominating the portfolio. If it's crept up to 20% of your portfolio, you need to sell some of it and diversify. All right, let's talk about something else. No one wants to talk about boring old stock index funds. Everyone wants to talk about something else, even though 85% of my portfolio is in boring old stock index funds. And hopefully a very large percentage of yours is in boring old stock index funds. But it's hard to fill 52, 30 to 60 minute long podcasts a year, talking only about boring old index funds. I don't know what else to tell you about them. Go buy a bunch of index funds. They're boring, but they really work if you hold onto them long-term and you're very well diversified. It's basically free to buy all the most profitable corporations in the history of the world. But apparently now we need to talk about private equity. INVESTING IN PRIVATE EQUITY Ash: Hello, Jim, this is Ash from Virginia. I was speaking with my financial advisor recently, and he recommended that I invest in private equity as a way to diversify and reduce market correlation. Otherwise, I am heavily invested in index funds, Vanguard index funds. I was wondering if you thought this was a good idea, neutral, or a bad idea. Thank you so much. Dr. Jim Dahle: The problem I have with private equity is that the term is so broad, it means almost nothing. All private means is that it's not traded on the stock market. Private equity is all the businesses in the world that are not traded on the stock market. That includes the self-employed person in some developing country in Africa and a sheep herd. Private equity. He raises the sheep, he sells the sheep for profit, he gets some milk from the sheep, whatever. Private equity. The White Coat Investor, private equity. It's privately owned. It's not owned by the stock market. It's not owned publicly, so it's private equity. A lot of real estate is private equity real estate. If you're investing on the equity side, not the debt side, it's private equity real estate, and obviously I own some of that. Some of our advertisers on this podcast offer private equity real estate investments. When we talk about private equity, it's a little hard to know exactly what people are talking about, but it's this cool catchphrase that everybody thinks sounds really smart, and so everyone says, “I should invest in private equity. You have any private equity investments?” And guess what? If you ask for it, and it can be sold, and a profit can be made on it, somebody will offer you that to invest in. Whether you should invest in it or not is a completely different story. There's lots of benefits to being in the public markets. You get very liquid investment. It's very transparent, it's regulated. The price changes minute by minute throughout the trading days, so you're always getting current pricing. There's lots of benefits of being in the public markets. There are also benefits to being in the private market. Imagine if we had to figure out what White Coat Investor was worth every day, and that affected how we ran the company. You don't need those sorts of pressures, and lots of other people have decided, “I don't need those sorts of pressures in my business either, so I'm going to stay private.” Even public corporations sometimes go private. They basically get bought out, and somebody takes them private, they're no longer traded on the stock market. So lots of ways that you can invest in private equity. But there's lots of funds out there that call themselves private equity funds, and they're doing all kinds of different things. Sometimes they use a whole bunch of leverage, and they're buying something and trying. This is what happens with physician groups and hospitals, they try to pull as much profit out of it as they can, and then resell it in three or four or five years for a higher profit. And obviously, you know how that affects how that business runs. You've seen it happen in your hospitals, you've seen it happen in your physician groups, lots of things implode. It can be pretty bad when something's backed by private equity. Those of you who have been sending emails to me about this hospital corporation that's gone bankrupt, it owned my hospital just a year or two ago, and it wasn't good. While the CEO and other staff were enriching themselves off the money in the company and running it into the ground, we couldn't get somebody to come fix the CT scan. They wouldn't come out because they hadn't been paid in six months when the CT scan broke. So we were literally putting people in an ambulance to send them to another campus of our hospital to get a CT scan. Meanwhile, that campus was sending people to our campus in order to get ultrasounds. And we were going to a third campus to get MRIs. It's ridiculous. If you run businesses primarily for profit, they usually don't last very long. You got to put the mission before profit. I mean, no margin, no mission, but you got to put the mission before profit or the company's just not going to be around very long. And that's what a lot of private equity type investments have been accused of. So, keep that in mind if you decide you want to support that sort of model by doing that. Okay, now there is a big trend toward this though. In fact, Vanguard just announced a partnership and I was hoping not to talk about this until the fall when it's really a little bit more sorted out exactly what they're doing. But they've launched a partnership, I think with BlackRock to have some sort of private public fund they can offer to their advised clients and even their non-advised clients with this idea that adding some private equity to your portfolio can juice your returns. Well, maybe it can, maybe it can't, time will tell. I don't have plans right now to add a private equity fund to my portfolio. I certainly have plenty of my net worth invested in private equity already with the White Coat Investor. And I've got a good chunk of my real estate on the private side as well. So, here's my cautions for private investments. One, you often need to be an accredited investor to buy them. The rules for that, the legal rule is you got to make $200,000 plus a year for each of the last two years, or you got to have a million dollars in investable assets. That is an inadequate rule in my opinion. If you're going to invest outside the publicly traded markets, I think you need to be a real accredited investor. And I define that number one, as you can evaluate the investment without the assistance of an advisor, accountant or attorney. And number two, that you can lose your entire investment without really affecting your financial life in any significant way. If you meet those two criteria, I think it's fine to wade into the private markets and buy some investments. You still need to follow the good principles of diversification and portfolio construction. You want high returning assets with low correlation with each other. You're trying to build a portfolio here, not just build a collection of investments. Keep that in mind, but I think it's okay to add some private investments to your portfolio. Keep in mind the liquidity issues in the private markets. And often you can't get your money back for years. If you needed a whole bunch of money this year, you're not going to be able to get it. Only some of your portfolio is appropriate being illiquid investments. Keep that in mind, but I don't know that you're going to juice your returns in the private equity markets. Maybe you'll have higher returns. Maybe you'll have higher risk adjusted returns. Maybe they'll have a low correlation with your publicly traded investments, but it feels faddish to me. It feels like a trend. So, let's watch it. There's no rush to invest in anything. Let's see how this Vanguard partnership goes. There's a bunch of other ones coming out this fall as well. Let's watch them for a year or two, see what they do and decide, “Hey, is this something I want to add a slice of to my portfolio or not?” Keep in mind, this is a game with no called strikes. You don't have to swing at any given investment. You can just let them keep on coming by and you don't have to invest in everything to be successful. You don't have to have gold and Bitcoin and private real estate and private equity and all this stuff, small value stocks and Hong Kong stocks. You don't have to have all this stuff to be successful. You need something like three to 10 asset classes in your portfolio. You want each asset class to be broadly diversified like what you'd get in an index fund. And then you need to fund it adequately and stick with it in the long-term. That's what leads you to investing success. That's what leads you to completing, reaching your financial goals. That's the goal. Investing is a one person game. It's you against your goals. It's not you trying to beat the market. It's not you trying to beat anybody else. Balance your FOMO against your fear of loss and don't go chasing the latest shiny thing. That's a sure pathway to investment failure. Let's keep an eye out on private equity. I'll be writing more about it, talking more about it this fall. It's definitely out there. It is probably going to show up in some 401(k)s and it's going to show up at your favorite brokerages. But every investment is individual and has to be evaluated on its own merits. It's unlikely there's ever going to be an index fund for private equity investments. All of them have to be looked at individually if you want to invest in them. All right. Thanks everybody out there for what you do. It is not easy work. As I mentioned, I got five shifts this week. I've done three. I got two more in the next two days. And it's good to work like a real doc this week and remind myself of my roots and where I come from and take care of people. There's a lot of people out there who are much less fortunate than we are, who deserve good medical care and they're looking for some relief and comfort in a terrible time in their lives. And it's a pleasure and honor to be able to help them do that. Thanks for those of you who have chosen to do this with your life. And I know some days are rougher than others. And if today's one of those days and nobody told you thanks all day, let me be the first. VANGUARD AND SPEC ID Okay. We need to talk about another issue here. People are hounding me with emails about this issue. I have written the blog post. It's going to run between the time I'm recording this. And when you hear this, this is an issue about a letter Vanguard is sending out. Let's hear the question to start with. And a bunch of you I know have gotten this letter. Marcy: Hi Jim, this is Marcy from the Midwest. Quick question. Got a letter from Vanguard saying that they are no longer doing Spec ID as the preferred cost basis method for their holdings. And now they're going to an automated either first in first out, a minimum tax or a highest in first out option when selecting for cost basis. They say that it's to help with automation of certain loss. We use the spec ID to help with tax loss harvesting. Do you have an opinion on how this affects us or which one we should choose? Thank you so much. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay. First of all, go back and read the blog post. It's scheduled to run on August 2nd. That should be before you ever hear this podcast. But the letter they're sending you says this. It says, “Dear investor, whatever your name is, we noticed you've selected specific identification as your preferred cost basis method for certain holdings in your account. While you'll still be able to use spec ID for individual transactions. While you'll still be able to use spec ID for individual transactions.” Did you hear that? Nothing else matters in this letter. You'll still be able to use Spec ID for your individual transactions. I use specific identification. Cause I do the same thing you do. I'm tax loss harvesting and I want to harvest the losses. All they're asking here you to do is they're asking you to pick an automated method of cost basis. In the event that you had some sort of automated thing set up, for instance, you had set it up such that it automatically sends you $400 a month out of your brokerage account so you can live on it. Well, it needs to know, well, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to do first in first out? Are we supposed to do min tax? Are we supposed to do highest in first out? That's all they're asking. But hopefully you're not selling any of your taxable holdings that way. You're specifically identifying which tax slots you want to sell from. And so long as you do that, this question doesn't matter at all. Doesn't matter what you pick. But if for whatever reason it happened automatically, you probably want it to do what they call min tax or minimum tax, because that's what you do most of the time when you're trying to sell your shares is you want the one that's going to cost you the least in taxes. Choose min tax and recognize that when you go in there to tax loss harvest your taxable account, you're still going to be able to do specific identification. Then go check out that blog post if you want to hear about all the other methods of cost basis methods. I got all the ones in there from Fidelity and there's way more at Fidelity than there is a Vanguard. All the ones in there from Schwab. They got all these cool ones, low cost short term and high cost long term and tax sensitive short term and tax lot optimizer. There's all these other methods of cost basis selection out there. But just set it as min tax and recognize you can still do specific identification when you actually go in there to sell shares. Hopefully that's helpful. All right, I think we've got another question here from Ricardo. Maybe it's the same Ricardo as the other question but let's take a listen. TAX LOSS HARVESTING Ricardo: Hey Jim, this is Ricardo again. I had a question regarding tax loss harvesting. I do own my own internal medicine primary care practice and I've had it for the last 16 years so I anticipate eventually to sell it and at that point make a capital gains and be responsible for that tax. One strategy I wanted to use is to have tax loss harvesting and use those losses to offset that capital gains when I do sell my practice. My question is how to exactly do this? And I know you did an excellent post detailing in detail through Vanguard how to do the tax loss harvesting. But on an emotional basis, when I do see a loss, let's say there's $50,000 loss in my portfolio, I get nervous because I've always heard “Don't sell low and don't sell a loss”, but that's exactly what we're doing when we tax loss harvesting. Now, I understand you have to buy another stock which is similar but not identical, but emotionally I just have a hard time selling when I'm at a loss. So just please reassure me that this is the right process that you do sell a loss, but then you buy another stock which is similar but not identical. If I don't feel comfortable doing this, do you think that's something for tax loss harvesting? Is that something that's worthwhile getting one of the recommended financial advisors on your website? Thanks again and really, really appreciate everything you do for us. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, good question. First, let's talk about the emotional aspect here. These are losses, it hurts to sell low. You don't want to buy high and sell low. That's a recipe for investment disaster and financial catastrophe. But that's not what you're doing when you're tax loss harvesting. You are selling low and buying low. You are exchanging. You're really not changing your portfolio at all. I hope you're not investing in individual stocks because it's really hard to tax loss harvest because you know what? Tesla is not the same as Microsoft. You cannot get something very similar when you're tax loss harvesting individual stocks. It's very hard. Maybe there's something similar, but for most of them, there's nothing that's really very similar. That's not the case when you're using ETFs or mutual funds. You can sell the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and you can buy the iShares Total Stock Market Index Fund 18 seconds later and you've sold low and bought low. And you basically have the same portfolio, but you know what? When you get your 1099 div at the end of the year, you're going to have that $50,000 tax loss and you can save those up. You can only use $3,000 a year against your ordinary income. You can use an unlimited amount against tax gains, but hopefully you're not generating too many of those throughout your career. And then hopefully you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars of these tax losses saved up for the end of your career when you sell your practice. By the way, great job establishing a practice and building some value there that you'll be able to sell later. But this would be great. If you could line up half a million dollars of tax losses throughout your career and then you sell this practice for $750,000, that's $500,000 of that gain that you don't have to pay taxes on. That might save you $100,000 in taxes. It can be a lot of money. That's the idea behind tax loss harvesting. I tend to do mine manually. I think maybe someday I'll sell the White Coat Investor. Tax losses would be pretty useful to me. So I keep acquiring them, even though I have far more than I'll ever need at $3,000 a year. And I really don't expect to ever realize any capital gains in my taxable ETF portfolio. We tend to flush them out doing charitable giving. And our basis really isn't even all that low, but we keep acquiring these tax losses just in case we sell our house or we sell our business or whatever. We're doing the same thing you are. Now, there are companies that try to get you more tax losses out there. They maybe have a special algorithm where they're trying to do this with various ETFs or they're doing direct indexing. And if their fees are very, very low, it's possible that the tax losses will be more valuable than what you're paying in those fees, but you have to be careful. If you're paying 0.7 or 0.8% a year just for tax losses, you're not going to have the value there that you're looking for. And certainly if you're going to a full service advisor that's charging you 1% a year on a multimillion dollar portfolio, I'm not sure the value's there either, especially compared to what you can do yourself. This isn't that complicated. It sounds like you're managing your portfolio yourself. This is not a big add to somebody. You can handle the rest of their portfolio chores. But if you need some help, it doesn't hurt to go use one of these financial advisors that specializes in validators that helps you teach you some things for a year or two, and then you can go out on your own. It's not like you have to use the advisor for the rest of your life just because you needed some help learning how to do some of these things. A lot of those people on our recommended list do specialize in helping validators to become do-it-yourselfers, but the value of tax losses depends on your financial life. You sound like you are going to have a big taxable gain at some point in your life so you have a little more value to a tax loss than other people do. I think it's well worth learning how to do this yourself and it's probably worth considering getting somebody to help you do it professionally. I think we covered on this podcast a few months ago direct indexing. You could convince me that paying 10 basis points a year to do direct indexing might be worth it for you given your situation, but I don't know that everybody needs to do that sort of a thing. Really you have to step back and ask yourself “How much are additional tax losses worth to me?” Because just about every White Coat Investor with a taxable account can get enough of them pretty darn easily to have $3,000 a year to use against their ordinary income.

Okay, we've got a unique milestone today, as you heard with the title of this podcast. But yes, we're still going to be talking about finances. This is a finance podcast. You can't come on here with milestones that aren't financial, just FYI. We've got to twist whatever milestone you've accomplished and still talk about finances to inspire others to really take the wheel and take advantage of all the wonderful things that are available to them in this world, if you can manage your finance as well. Stick around after this interview. I want to talk for a few minutes about sequence of returns risk and some of the methods to deal with it. If that term is totally new to you, you definitely want to stick around after this podcast. INTERVIEW Our guest today on the Milestones to Millionaire podcast is Adam. Adam, welcome to the podcast. Adam: Thanks, Jim. Really love your podcast. I'm so glad I can be a part of it today. Dr. Jim Dahle: Well, we're excited to have you on this. This is actually the last of five podcasts I'm recording today, which is always fun to have a really great one at the end. And this one's going to be a little bit unique. Let's give people a sense of where you're at in life. What part of the country do you live in? What do you do for a living? How far are you out of your training? Adam: All right, I live in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I'm a non-operative sports medicine physician and I am coming up on 12 years out of training. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, very cool. All right, tell us what milestone we're celebrating today. Adam: Well, this year, my squirt hockey team that my son plays on won the Wisconsin State Championship. Dr. Jim Dahle: That's pretty awesome. Okay, for those who aren't aware, squirts are like nine and 10 years old are basically what squirts are. Adam: Exactly, yep. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, you won the state championship and that's no small feat in Wisconsin. You're not in Utah here. We have hockey here. We're really proud we've got an NHL team now but let's be honest, we are not a huge hockey state like Minnesota and Michigan, Alaska, et cetera. So this is no small accomplishment in Wisconsin. But as I told you before we started recording, we can't just celebrate state championships. So we got to delve a little bit into the financial aspects of this. What is it in your life that has allowed you to spend enough time coaching that you can have a state championship team? Adam: Well, I would say my story starts coming out of residency and reading books like yours right away. That was right about the time I graduated was when your book came out and following a solid financial plan over the last decade has really allowed me to set things up to where I don't have to worry about money anymore and I'm at a stage in life where I can really just focus on the things that matter now like my faith and my family and my health. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. Would you describe yourself as financially independent already or you just feel like you're on the fast track to get there? Adam: I would say I'm at coast fire at this point. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. Adam: If I don't put anything else into retirement from now until I retire, I'll be good. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. I'm not sure we've done coast fire as a milestone. We should have done coast fire. That's even better. Okay, we got to hear about the hockey team though. Is this a travel team? I assume it's a travel team if there's a state championship. Adam: Yes, this is a travel team. We travel all over the place in Wisconsin. We live about an hour away from the Twin Cities and so we probably play a third of our games against teams in Minnesota which really has helped to grow our program and advance. Just blessed to have a group of kids that really works hard and they all push themselves and as a result, we've had really a lot of success this year and it culminated with a state championship which was really cool. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah, that's very fun. You got a kid on the team, I assume? Adam: Yes, I've got my my second of four, Sam, he's just turned 11 but he was on the team. He had a great year. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, what position does Sam play? Adam: Sam is the center. Dr. Jim Dahle: Okay, what line is Sam on? Is Sam the first line center? Adam: We rotated two centers on three lines this year and I would say they're pretty equal. It really didn't matter who started. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool, very fun. At some point along the way this year, especially with you going all the way to the state championship, there were some times when that really didn't work well with work. So, tell us what you did with work when there were conflict. Adam: If I had over a month notice, I could take the time off. What a lot of people don't know is that youth sports and as a sports medicine physician, this is the world I live in, youth sports has kind of taken over and so a lot of tournaments now start on Friday and they might even start on Friday morning. Dr. Jim Dahle: You have to travel Thursday night. Adam: Sometimes, yes, but most of the time it's just early Friday morning. I probably missed the coolest game of the year this year. We played in a tournament in Minnesota and the opposing team coaches were Zach Parise and David Dubnik from the Wild. And so their kids were on the other bench and that was the game I missed. Dr. Jim Dahle: Did your team win the game? That's the question. Adam: No, actually. I'll make an excuse. The Minnesota kids, they had to use a different birth year. It's June to June or July to July and in Wisconsin, we're January to January. So our kids are ballpark six months younger than their kids, which makes a little bit of a difference in youth sports, especially at this age. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah. Well, it's interesting is a lot of people don't know this, but some huge percentage, I don't know what it is, 63% or 70% of NHL players are born in January to March. Adam: Yes. Dr. Jim Dahle: And the reason why is because they're just a little bit older. And so at every level, they're a little bit older, a little bit better than their peers. And so, those are the ones that end up in the NHL eventually. It's a really curious statistic. Okay, sometimes you've got to be there on Friday and what? You rely on your partners, you cancel clinic. What do you do when that happens? Adam: I usually am booked out about a week. And so, if I got 30 days notice, I can just shift. I'm not having to really cancel patients. One of the things that I noticed after probably about six years in the area that I'm in is that no matter how hard I work, my system is going to give me about 80 patients a week. And if I can do that in five days a week, great. There was a point a few years ago that I realized I could really do that in four days a week. And so, I take one day a week off and I just get all the patients in the rest of the time. And it's allowed me to see everybody that I need to see through my system, but also has given me a little bit more family time, a little more time to get things ready, to get practices planned, to get to connect with my wife a little more. All those things have happened, I guess, happenstance. But that's really worked out because of being paid on production, I can work four days a week and see the same number of people. And I never took a pay cut when I dropped my FTE. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah, very cool. And those other things, of course, are what life's really made out of, right? All these other things that really are the priorities. Sometimes we don't always remember that or always treat them that way, but they are the priorities. Okay, give us a sense. You got more than one kid in travel sports, I'm guessing. Adam: We have four right now. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah. Okay, let's talk about the expense of travel sports. What's it cost to be a player on your state championship team? What did parents spend this year to have a kid on that team? Adam: $1,500 was the association fee to join the team, about an extra $200 for jerseys, and then four weekends in hotels, each weekend ballpark $500. Dr. Jim Dahle: Well, you clearly are in Wisconsin and Minnesota, if you can get the whole weekend. Adam: Yeah, I guess you call it geographic arbitrage. Dr. Jim Dahle: That's it. That's pretty good. Plus gear, of course. Hockey gear is not trivial. Adam: Now, hockey is you roll right from the winter season into a spring season, and then you've got a camp all summer, and they're trying to get my kid to play on a fall team now. And I'm going, we need to do some other things. We need to get them, give them a little bit of a break. Dr. Jim Dahle: Find a little bit of balance there. But your team fee is actually significantly cheaper than my kid. My kid's in high school now, but he pays that much just for the high school team. Adam: I played a little bit in med school. I was in New York City, and I played on Chelsea Pier, which is a really cool rink because it's elevated. It's off a ground level. And the fees there, it was like $1,000 every three months. Dr. Jim Dahle: Wow. Just for beer league hockey. Adam: Just for beer league hockey. Dr. Jim Dahle: Yeah, that's pretty wild. I guess that's what you get in a high cost living area. There's a message about geographic arbitrage there somewhere. If you want to play hockey, go to the Northern Midwest rather than Manhattan, I guess. Okay, very cool. Well, this idea of coast fire is something not a lot of people have heard of. And that is a reasonable goal in and of itself. Clearly, early in your career, becoming financially comfortable, whatever, was important to you and your spouse. Why? Why did you end up saving enough money that you now no longer have to save for retirement? Adam: The answer to that question is probably pretty complex. I was really interested in finance during residency and started reading books about it and started initially listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast about getting out of debt. And then when I started to read that and really tackle the debt, that was before student loan advice was available or else I probably would have done the PSLF route. But then I started reading other books that was kind of a snowball into books like yours, where I started learning about all the different retirement accounts that I could invest in and set up. And really throughout the last decade, I just maximized everything that was available. Every year we max out a 401(k), we max out a 457 plan, backdoor Roth IRAs. And then I'm lucky enough to work for a company that also would put about $30,000 every year in addition into retirement. After I had kind of gotten financially literate about four years into training, I approached my system because they weren't offering a mega backdoor Roth and none of our financial people had heard of it. And so kind of talked them into, hey, this is the thing that's available. And after about a year, that was available. And so then I started maxing that out too. Really just have done everything that has been offered. And we kind of look at things where we pay ourselves first, and then we live on what's left over. And right now that's turned into about $2 million in investable assets. Dr. Jim Dahle: Cool. And given that you're only 12 years out of training, there's plenty of time for that double to double once or twice while you're still working, which is pretty cool. Okay, there's somebody out there sitting around going, “Is this all there is to life? I sure would like to spend more time with my family. I'd like to coach a team. I'd like to do some of these things that you're doing in your life now.” What advice do you have for that doc? Adam: The biggest thing is you have to live within your means. You can't spend money that you don't have. That's probably the biggest thing. The way we have our life set up is that most things come out before the paycheck ever comes home. Once the paycheck does come home, we set aside money for our giving every month. And then after that, we live on what's left. And that's been more than enough to cover all of our expenses and everything that we want to do. If there's someone else out there that wants to live life to the fullest, I would say that's the process and the steps. Dr. Jim Dahle: Very cool. Adam, congratulations on what you've accomplished. Congratulations to you and your team. Adam: Thank you. Dr. Jim Dahle: And not only your team, including your spouse and kids that have worked on your finances, but your hockey team. It's got to feel pretty good to take them all the way and put that trophy up in the air and have them enjoy that feeling, that accomplishment, even at the young, tender age of nine or ten years old. So, congratulations to all of you. Adam: It's been really, really cool. I also want to put a plug. I know you're a hockey guy. If you're ever interested, Wisconsin hosts the USA National Pond Hockey Championship every year. The way one of my buddies put it, it's like Disneyland for hockey players. And so, it's in Eagle River, Wisconsin, first, second weekend in February every year. They get several hundred teams, 24 rinks. And it is a blast. I know you're an experienced guy, that's an experience. It would be great to have you out sometime to do that. Dr. Jim Dahle: One of my fellow coaches on the high school hockey team went out and played this year. I was coaching while he was playing, but it does sound like a great experience. I would like to come out and maybe we can put together a White Coat Investor pond hockey team and go out there and clean up. Adam: I would imagine there are enough White Coat Investors out there that we could probably field a solid squad. Dr. Jim Dahle: Nice. We'll let you go. Thank you so much for your time. Adam: All right. Thanks, Jim. Dr. Jim Dahle: All right. That was fun. It's always fun to talk to a hockey player and a hockey coach. And it's fun what we can accomplish when we have our finances on track. You can have evenings to spend coaching your kids or whatever else is important to you in life. If you just get your financial ducks in a row, it's part of the why. You got to have a “why” to do all this stuff. So, let's make sure we do that. FINANCE 101: SEQUENCE OF RETURNS RISK I told you at the top of the hour, we're going to talk a little bit about sequence of returns risk, SORR. If you're not familiar with this term, you need to be, particularly if you're getting anywhere near retiree. Sequence of returns risk is the risk that despite having adequate average returns from your portfolio to support your retirement spending, you run out of money because the poor returns came first. That's what sequence of returns risk is. You had a bad sequence. You had the bad returns first before the good returns came. Because when your portfolio is falling in value and you're withdrawing substantial sums from it, it makes it more likely that you run out of money. And now obviously there are other ways to return on money. If you don't manage your money, you're going to run out of money. If you don't save much for retirement, you're probably running out of money in retirement. And if you have some massive, huge, unexpected expenses, like you decided you're not going to buy health insurance and you had a cancer or some terrible trauma you had landed in the ICU for, maybe you run out of money. Or some long-term care situation you weren't prepared for, maybe you run out of money. But for the most part, if you've done a good job saving for retirement, you do a good job managing your money, the risk to worry about is this sequence of returns risk. You have crummy returns in the first one, two, three, five years of retirement. The worry is that you're retiring into the next great depression, that you're retiring into the stagflation of the 1970s. And so, that is something that you probably ought to have a plan for as part of your written financial plan. So, let's talk about what those plans might look like. First of all, one plan that works for lots and lots and lots of White Coat Investors, it's almost a default plan, an error plan, is to just be rich. If you're very wealthy, if you retire very wealthy, sequence of returns risk just doesn't exist for you. Let me give you an example. Let's say we got a retired couple, they spend $200,000 a year. And because they did such a great job earning and saving and investing throughout their career, they retired with $10 million. $200,000 a year of $10 million is 2%. If you're only spending 1 or 2 or 3% of your portfolio a year, you're basically bulletproof from sequence of returns risk. The entire world has to melt down for you to run out of money. This is not the people who really have serious sequence of returns risk. If you're perfectly comfortable spending 1% of your portfolio, you're going to be fine. The truth is on average, if you look at the data used when they're putting together things like the 4% guideline, they note that on average, when people spend 4% of their portfolio, adjusted upward with inflation each year as they go along, after 30 years, on average, they have 2.7 times what they retired with. The sequence of returns issue, the reason why that's only 4% rule instead of the 6% rule or the 8% rule is because occasionally, you get those bad returns first. That is where it comes from. Another solution besides just being really wealthy, if you're not spending anywhere near 4% of your money, that works fine. Another method is to work late and work a long time. Let's say you're one of those docs that just loves it and you keep working until you're 70, 72, 75. Well, guess what? If you're still working until you're 75, your life expectancy is probably something like eight, 10, 12 years, something like that. All these studies that look at sequence of returns risk, they're really looking at 30 year time periods. If you are only going to be retired for a decade before you die, even if you live a little longer than you expect and you make it 15 years, guess what? You're not going to run out of money. The people who really need to worry about sequence of returns risk are the early retirees. If you're retiring at 45, 50, 55, you might have a longer than 30 year time period and maybe that'll result in you spending less than 4% or doing some more of these strategies that I'm going to talk about to deal with that sequence of returns risk. But working late or at least having the ability to go back to work and work some of those years in retirement has a dramatic effect on how all of this works. All of a sudden, instead of having to withdraw a whole bunch of your portfolio in a year the market is down or a couple of year period when the market is down, you can live off some of the money you earn and it just works dramatically better. You don't run out of money. Sequence of returns risk basically goes away. Okay, here's another method. Another method is to guarantee a whole bunch of your income. And now social security is a guaranteed income. Obviously, you got to pay attention to who stands behind the guarantee. In the case of social security, it's the US government. But delaying your social security to age 70 gives you the best deal out there on an inflation adjusted immediate annuity. Basically, you can put the highest floor possible under your guaranteed income, your guaranteed spending. And that can really help a lot in a year when markets are down. There are other sources of guaranteed income. You might have a pension from a job you took. You can also buy an immediate annuity. You can go to insurance company and give them $100,000 and they might give you something as high as $600 a month for that $100,000. Obviously, you can buy more of those. If you want more than $600 of guaranteed spending a month, maybe you can buy a quarter million dollar one on yourself, another quarter million dollar one on your spouse. Now we're talking about $3,000 a month of guaranteed income. So you combine that with your social security and all of a sudden, well, that's not too bad. Even if markets are down, we got to cut back our spending a little bit. We've got all of our essential fixed expenses covered by guaranteed income. That's a method that works very well. Here's another method that works. A big risk in sequence risk and the sequence of returns risk is not just that you have poor returns. It's that you have poor inflation adjusted returns or real returns. The worst time period actually historically, if you look at the data for US stock and bond returns is actually the 70s. And it's not because returns were so terrible. The returns were not good by any means. The problem was inflation went way up. And so, the real returns were really particularly bad. And you can reduce that risk by having more assets in your portfolio that tend to do well in inflationary kind of period. Now you can buy some bonds that are indexed to inflation like I bonds, like treasury inflation, protected securities or TIPS. Those help protect you from inflation rather than having all your bonds in nominal bonds, especially long-term nominal bonds. But just having things in there like real estate and stocks also helps protect you from inflation. Sometimes people add some other stuff, commodities or some crypto assets or some precious metals or things like that to help protect from inflation. That's reasonable to do with a small percentage of your portfolio. But if you think about inflation being the biggest risk you're facing, you'll design your portfolio a little bit differently to try to protect you against inflation rather than having 60% of your retirement portfolio in long-term nominal treasuries, which may not be the best move if inflation really rears its ugly head. The main thing people do when they're worried about sequence of returns risk is they just reduce the volatility of their portfolio. They take less risk. And that's typically during the last few years before you retire in the first five years or so after you retire, more bonds in your portfolio, more CDs, whatever, these fixed income investments that aren't nearly as volatile as your stocks, not nearly as volatile as your real estate. And so, you can just put a little bit more money in bonds. In fact, that's often called a bond tent. You have a few years where you have more of your portfolio in bonds a few years before and after your retirement date. And then you actually can get more aggressive a little bit later with your portfolio once you've gotten through that really bad sequence of returns risk time period. Another thing people will do with bonds is they will actually create a ladder of individual bonds. Typically, these are treasury bonds and typically they're inflation protected bonds. So you're making a TIPS ladder. So you actually put whatever you want to spend for those first five years of retirement into TIPS. Let's say you're going to retire in five years and you want a five-year TIPS ladder to get you through that worst of the sequence of returns risk period. You're buying a five-year TIPS, you're buying a six-year TIPS, a seven-year TIPS, eight-year TIPS, nine-year TIPS. You're buying these TIPS bonds so that you will have that money to spend for that year and maybe you put your entire expected spending amount for that year in TIPS. Maybe it's $100,000 or $200,000 for each of those years and you make your TIPS ladder for it. Well now even if the market tanks the day you retire and it stays down for three, four, five years, you're fine because you don't have to touch that money. You're going to be spending the money coming out of that TIPS ladder every year. Now obviously if you only have a five-year TIPS ladder and you have a nine-year period of terrible returns, you can still have some sequence of returns risk but a five-year TIPS ladder is going to get you through an awful lot of that. Now that's the mindset behind some other strategies. You've heard of the bucket strategy probably and the idea behind that is you put one or two or three years worth of spending in cash and you put you know years four through six or eight or ten in the bonds and after that you invest the rest of the portfolio aggressively. And in a typical year you replenish each of the buckets. You sell some of the bonds and move it into cash, you sell some of the stocks or real estate and move it into bonds and you replenish the buckets. But in a bad year you don't replenish the buckets. You allow your you know more risky assets to continue to grow and you just realize “Hey, that's what this bucket is for. This bucket was for sequence of returns risk. We're just going to spend from it. We won't replenish it until you know the good returns come back in two years or three years or four years or five years or whatever.” That's one strategy people use. People use all kinds of different withdrawal strategies and most of them the goal is to manage sequence of returns risk. A popular one right now is called the guardrails strategy and there's these rules involved in the strategy when returns are this and you do this when returns are this you do that and that helps you decide how much to take out of your portfolio, where to take it from and manage that spending to try to minimize the sequence of returns risk. But the main idea behind it is just to spend less. When the risk shows up you go “Okay, well, I got to cut back.” Now some people are surprised just how much they have to cut back their spending in those years. It's not cutting back your spending just 10%. That'll help but you might have to reduce spending if this is your only method of dealing with sequence of returns risk. You might have to reduce spending by 40 or 50% and for more than a year one two three five years that's possible. So, if your only method of sequence of return risk mitigation is reducing spending you better be prepared to reduce spending a lot in order to make sure you don't run out of money before the end. But that's the concept of sequence of returns risk. Those are the basic ways of dealing with it. You ought to know about what that is. You ought to have a plan for it if you're getting close to retirement. You ought to put that plan into your written financial plan. I hope that's helpful to you. SPONSOR All right.

Title: Property prices rising 11 times faster than wages, with typical value now €370,000

Property prices rising much faster than wages Property prices are rising at multiples of the wage increases workers are receiving. Prices shot up by 8pc in the year to June, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This means the typical, or median, price of a property is now €370,000, up €32,500 in a year. The increase is more than 11 times the amount by which average earnings rose in the last year, according to calculations by independent economist Austin Hughes. Wages increased by around €2,800. The CSO figures come on the back of a recent report from Daft.ie that found Irish house price inflation had reached a 10-year-high. June’s rise of 7.8pc is the same rate of property price inflation recorded in May. New supply appears to be at least limiting the pace of price increases Mr Hughes said house price growth was now steady, but values were still increasing at a strong pace. He said rising employment and falling interest rates were sustaining affordability in the face of rising property prices. “Encouragingly, new supply appears to be at least limiting the pace of price increases,” he said. Sales of new homes were up 22pc in the first half of the year, while sales of second-hand properties were broadly flat. The June figures for the property price index from the CSO represent the 22nd month in a row in which prices have risen, putting the squeeze on first-time buyers and movers. Second-hand home prices are increasing at more than twice the rate of those of new homes. Today's News in 90 Seconds - August 21st A severe shortage of new properties to buy means many first-timers are bidding against those trading up and people who are moving. This is driving up second-hand prices. In the three-month period to June, new home prices were 4.2pc higher than in the same quarter last year, the CSO said. Prices of second-hand homes in the second quarter of this year were 8.8pc higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.6pc in June, and those outside Dublin were up by 8.8pc compared with June last year. The median price of a dwelling bought in the 12 months to June was €370,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €190,000 in Leitrim. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June was A94, which takes in Blackrock, Co Dublin. It had a median price of €780,000. The F45 Eircode, which takes in Castlerea in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In June, 4,029 dwelling purchases were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.7bn. These comprised 3,092 existing dwellings and 937 new. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June. The regions outside Dublin that recorded the largest growth in house prices were the west, comprising Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, at 10.3pc. The midlands recorded price growth of 10.2pc. At the other end of the scale, the south-east area that takes in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford recorded a 7.1pc rise in house prices.

Title: Will Bitcoin Beat Every Asset Class? Bitwise Says Institutions Are Taking Notice
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beat-every-asset-class-bitwise-institutions/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T03:00:43Z

Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios is continuing to evolve, with new research from Bitwise Asset Management suggesting the asset could become the strongest-performing major investment class in the years ahead. According to a preview of the firm’s forthcoming Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), Bitwise expects Bitcoin to deliver an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% over the next 10 years while experiencing gradually declining volatility. The report, authored by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, frames Bitcoin not as an opportunistic play but as a maturing asset that is increasingly being considered a core portfolio component. Hougan noted that the launch and adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a turning point, prompting large investment platforms and allocators to begin requesting long-term models for Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Hougan explained that long-term capital market assumptions serve as the foundation for how major financial institutions design portfolios. Each year, firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock release detailed outlooks that guide asset allocation strategies. For the first time in 2025, professional investors have begun requesting that Bitcoin be included in these frameworks, with Bitwise reporting 12 such inquiries this year compared to none in previous years. “The fact that they’re now asking for long-term capital market assumptions means that they’ve shifted their view: It’s no longer a one-off for the fringes of the portfolio; it’s starting to be considered for the core,” Hougan said in the memo. He attributed this change to greater accessibility through regulated ETFs and approval by large account platforms managing trillions in client assets. Bitwise also emphasized that Bitcoin’s path toward institutional recognition has been gradual, requiring both regulatory clarity and infrastructure improvements. The launch of spot ETFs in January 2024 created a new on-ramp for traditional allocators, and subsequent approvals across national platforms have since accelerated the process. Hougan described the transition as occurring “brick by brick,” as Bitcoin gains a foothold in professional investment strategies. Looking ahead, Bitwise forecasts that BTC will not only outperform but stand apart from traditional assets in terms of expected returns. The firm projects a 28.3% CAGR over the next decade, significantly higher than the long-term expectations placed on equities, bonds, and private credit by leading Wall Street institutions. At the same time, while volatility is expected to remain elevated relative to other asset classes, Bitwise anticipates a steady decline as market depth expands and liquidity continues to improve. The implications of such a forecast extend beyond performance projections. A consistent inclusion of BTC in LTCMAs could formalize its role in balanced portfolios, shaping how pensions, endowments, and wealth managers approach diversification. Hougan cautioned that while risks remain, the framework is designed to give professional allocators a basis for strategic decision-making rather than a speculative outlook.

Title: Whales take $16 mln ETH to Bitcoin, yet Ethereum remains strong

Whales flee Ethereum for Bitcoin, but bullish ETH/BTC structure raises questions about altcoin season’s fate. Whales exited Ethereum, swapping $16 million for WBTC, while institutions withdrew $38 million in ETH. Retail holdings dropped, but ETH/BTC held 0.037 support. As the market underwent intense selling pressure, the largest capped cryptocurrency is emerging as the go-to safe haven. Whales and retail traders who panicked swapped Ethereum [ETH] for Bitcoin [BTC], while others closed leveraged trades at losses. Ethereum had outperformed BTC over the last three months. But was this the end of ETH’s relative strength? Some participants seemed to be accepting this as the end of ETH’s outperformance of BTC from their actions. One whale on Hyperliquid lost about $6.22 million in the crypto market crash. This trader had grown his starting capital of $125K to $7 million, with the peak at $43 million. The 4-month profits had been reduced to only $771K after liquidation. Per Lookonchain data, another whale swapped 3,900 ETH worth $16.26 million for 143.26 Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] at 0.03673, signaling capital rotation to BTC. Source: Lookonchain Historically, an ETH/BTC dump coupled with capital rotation has preluded the end of the altcoin season. So, will the narrative hold now? The ETH/BTC ratio held firm at 0.037, above support at 0.033. Its recent peak at 0.039 suggested momentum toward 0.040. Naturally, this pullback could explain liquidations and capital shifts. Yet, the pair has carved higher highs since April’s 0.025 low, keeping the structure bullish. Source: TradingView Anyway, institutional activities on the network and views of legendary traders suggested that the altcoin season was not yet over. Of importance, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale sold Ethereum on Coinbase as per Arkham. This ended their buying streak that started in early this year and intensified in April. The institutions usually sell their tokens at higher levels, prices crash, and then they go long at a cheaper cost. This usually shakes out weak hands. Supporting this intentional manipulation of price was the fact that other institutions were buying. Two institutional addresses withdrew $38 million in ETH from FalconX. CryptoQuant data added nuance. Retail holdings plunged to 8.6 million ETH, while large investors climbed to 10.8 million ETH. Source: CryptoGoos/X The institutional sell-off urged caution.

Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Quadrant Tony Thomas Australian schools are about to ramp up Net Zero campaigning using the latest movie “Future Council” from dark-green activist Damon Gameau. I’m predicting this with confidence because teachers have drenched more than a million kids from primary classes upwards with Gameau’s previous movie/docos 2040 (2019) and Regenerating Australia (2022). All-up his offerings (at last week) have got to 1,534,783 kids and launched about 50,000 largely school-based “action plans”. How does Gameau, 43, an ex-actor turned producer, achieve his startling reach into classrooms? It’s because all his far-left and environmental causes are taken up by Cool.org. Cool then delivers them as time-saving online lessons to Australia’s eager teachers. I’ve been tracking Cool.org as a cuckoo-in-the-school-nest for a decade, here, here, here, here and here. Formerly Cool Australia, it claims teachers now deliver its all-topics material to 2.5 million schoolkids a year and have reached 92% of schools. The lesson kits are expertly mapped to the curriculum and fulfil the cross-curriculum priority of “sustainability.”[1] As for promoting Gameau, Cool today offers teachers about 35 different lessons on his 2040 movie, and at least seven lessons on Regenerating Australia (37,000 students and 2637 Action Plans). The plot of Gameau’s 2040 is set in a future where renewables triumph over fossil fuels, vegans thrive, and every green brain-snap has proved a winner. That includes replacement of capitalism with UK ‘renegade economist’ Kate Raworth’s vision of a “doughnut [circular] economy”. Regenerating Australia likewise is set in 2029, looking back at a decade “that saw Australia transition to a fairer, cleaner, more regenerative economy that values Australia’s greatest assets – First Nations’ wisdom, our unique natural environment and our sense of community.”Now stand by for Future Council’s blitz into classrooms. Gameau spent last month on live Q&A’s at national pre-releases, and launched it officially on August 7. I took in his “inspiring and rollicking journey” at Yarraville’s olde-world Sun Theatre, along with 150 adoring parents and kids. It’s Gameau’s most ambitious venture yet and the audience, already green converts, went wild. Gameau and singer Ruby Rodgers from the film (she’s 15) took questions. Note this Feedback from previews: ♦ nichollerussell: “I can’t wait to see it tonight, I’m bringing my 2 classes or 42 students who are in year 3/4.” ♦ “There’s a lot of darkness in the world right now but holy smokes, @future__council is pure light.” ♦ “I cried through most of the doco. Our natural world is breathtaking, so full of wonder, and these kids remind us just how easy it is to forget that. They are rightfully scared about the future and angry at us adults for not doing enough to ensure their future … If we’re willing to listen, they might just show us the way.” ♦ “Damon Gameau, you’ve done it again. Another film that knocked me off my feet yet left me feeling stronger, more hopeful, and more determined to fight for this planet and all who call it home.”Gameau did a global casting call two years back for kids aged 10-14 to star in a road-trip movie traversing eight countries in western Europe in a cute yellow bus. The kids’ brief was to harangue corporate chiefs about emissions and plastic litter. From 1300 applicants, Gameau selected a diverse group of eight, based on their climate-warrior ethos, perkiness and affinity for show biz. Gameau emphasises that his bus ran on planet-friendly vegetable oil. He doesn’t mention the emissions from air-ferrying kids, plus a parent or guardian, to Europe. They came from places afar as Australia, Norfolk Island, Bali, Singapore and Uganda. As if the kids aren’t already brainwashed, he gets high-profile activists to gee them up. His theme is that school strikes haven’t saved the planet, and kids are looking for practical ways to rescue their future and work off their climate angst. The film is his marketing vehicle for his real-world Future Councils of kids, mostly schools-based. He aims to set up them here and worldwide as advisory boards to help reform back-sliding corporates. To make his bus trip look worthwhile, he has to big-up the so-called “climate crisis”. And here’s the rub: the poor little mites are traumatised by climate doom. Sure there’s a happy ending and the kids end the trip full of false hopes. That’s in line with psychs’ advice to scare them into activism, but not enough to paralyse them. Perhaps a bit sadistic? Other reviewers, all but one, gloss over this issue. The exception is James Joyce, executive editor of Australian Community Media and ex-editor of the Canberra Times, who I found in North West Star (paywalled, sadly). Joyce, apparently acquiescent in net-zero, still does a deadly interview of Gameau. Joyce: I started off feeling quite angry about what you were doing to these kids. I felt upset for them – that they were being asked to take all this on when they are just kids. By the end, there is some hope, inspiration, ideas and energy, which is great. But my first question is, are the kids alright? Gameau replied that the kids are not OK because we’re not doing anywhere near enough. They’re the generation that has to live in a polluted world and the point of the film is to let their voices be heard. “We don’t want these children to have to understand the complexities of the system and geopolitics,” he replies. “What the children bring is this refreshing creativity, they also bring a bloody morality that’s really missing from the system right now.” He said many leaders and big corporations are acting like psychopaths because that’s what the system allows: short-term thinking and maximum extraction. “And the children get to say ‘Hang on, where’s the humanity in all this?” Joyce: Are you saying that it’s fantasy or defensive or denial from grown-ups to say: ‘Can the kids just please be allowed to be kids? Can’t they have their childhood and not have to worry about this stuff until maybe they have actual agency in their lives?’ Instead of being in tears at age 10, don’t they deserve their innocence, their chance to not have to worry? Gameau said the crying 10-year-old in the film was actually frustrated by cleaning up beach plastic every weekend “and no one in her government or community is giving a shit like she does and she doesn’t understand”. (Gameau did not mention the film’s other kids who were depressed and pessimistic about a planetary apocalypse foisted on them by the climate crowd). Gameau said he still speaks to the kids most weeks and they’re all doing well. None are obsessed with trying to fix the planet themselves. They’ve got lots of other interests. “But I’m with you. I think, gosh, it’d be great if kids didn’t have to go through this.” Joyce: But my heart breaks for Skye [Welsh, about 12], who is so angry. At her age, doesn’t she deserve to not have that anger? Gameau: Yeah, you’re right. She does. But she’s in a village, Fairbourne, that’s about to go under the water – the first one in the Western world because of climate.” He said it’s so real to her because she’s losing her home and getting fire in her belly over it. “We can’t ask her just to stop because she’s fighting for something bigger than we understand. (Fairbourne’s watery grave by 2050 is just more worst-case climate baloney dished out by a green-left town council scared of lawsuits, and contrary to views of eminent scientists in those parts. Don’t take my word for it, it’s all spelt out in the local Cambrian News.) Joyce: But when [Qld-born eco-activist] Clover Hogan tells the kids “eco-anxiety is a really healthy response” – that stabbed me. Is it healthy for a 10-year-old? Gameau: If you’re not feeling some kind of emotion, where are you at? How disconnected are you actually with the living world? Let’s have a proper conversation because children are feeling things more deeply than maybe a few more adults should be. Joyce: There’s an impulse to say ‘Just leave the kids alone, let them be kids, stop turning them all into Greta Thunberg’. I think we’d prefer for our kids to be like the boy from Norfolk Island [called Hiva] who just cherishes birds and wants to take photos of them. Gameau: The kids in the film do come to realise that there are some really good humans who care about the planet and who have children and who are working in these massive corporations. So, perhaps the Greta [Thunberg] bolshie approach isn’t actually the only way to do this… We have to do things differently.As for the film itself, it opens with a glum Joaquin (from Holland), who looks about 12-14. He was born deaf but after a Cochlear implant can now speak several languages. He says, “I just hear nothing else, like complete death. When I think about the future, it’s not good. Yeah, it’s looking pretty dark. Companies not even trying to care about the planet. You know, I’m trying to live here too.” Whichever adults dumped their climate paranoia on this kid should examine their consciences. Gameau: Why do you all think that we’ve started this trip in a forest? Joaquin: So we can see what would be lost if humanity continues like this. Gameau: Very good answer. Soon after, Aurvi, 11, from Singapore, says she wouldn’t even in her thoughts think of hurting someone. But she visited the Great Barrier Reef and all the beautiful corals and fish and turtles could one day be gone. (Again, climate zealots have blighted her joy by doom-mongering about the Reef. Just last month the Institute of Marine Science’s annual reef data showed coral cover at record highs for the past several years, recently returning to about the 40-year average – despite six supposedly cataclysmic bleachings in the past decade).[2] Skye from Wales wrote to nature guru David Attenborough: I’m 12 years old and I live very near the village of Fairbourne, destined to become the first climate refugees of the developed world. The entire village is built on a flood plain and due to rising sea levels, by 2050 it is due to completely flood. As mentioned, this derives just from town councillors and activists doom-crying on their concocted worse-case scenarios. Bird-loving boy Hiva from Norfolk Island seems as dejected as Skye. He says birds are the ambassadors for wild places. Then he found out about critically endangered, vulnerable birds. “I could bring back a book in 30 years’ time about the extinct birds of the world and then I could have to write a sad introduction about all the things that people have done. I love them so much and I want them to be here no matter what.” He would try to see less money going to the companies that destroy and really hurt birds. The omission here is what suggests Gameau’s film is indoctrination not education. Why does Gameau not draw attention to the raptor-mincing ways of the wind turbines that he’d love to see dotting entire landscapes? There’s no wind turbines (yet) on Hiva’s Norfolk Island, but surely the kids on the bus notice a few during their trip through eight countries, and raise the bird issue? Ruby Rodgers, from NSW, is the granddaughter of rocker Jimmy Barnes and her singing is often on the film’s soundtrack. She says, “How we are treating the planet right now, and humanity, is quite scary.” Lines in the soundtrack from her songs include, “How can you tell me to keep on breathing? Tell me to keep believing while my home is being torn apart? Try not to give up, try to make a stand, ‘Coz I feel my future, Slippin’ from my hands.”Gameau’s film wheels out “experts” to calm the kids’ fears, like North-Queensland-born UK climate activist and Al Gore disciple Clover Hogan, now 24. At 16 she attended the UN’s Paris climate conference and at 19 she set up her “Force of Nature” entity to ally youngsters with decision-makers and jointly tackle the “climate deniers”.[3] Via google I find she touts the gamut of green-left causes like anti-capitalism and open borders. To Hogan, a UK government decision to open 42 new oilfields is “a death sentence” for her generation. And she wants the media to stop asking mean questions about activists’ “hypocritical” air travel, and instead “challenge the rich and powerful”. In the film one of the girls, about 14, asks her, “Like I’m not doing as much as everyone else and I just feel like there is so much pressure. It’s like, ‘Be doing more!’” But she doesn’t know what to do, and her voice cracks with emotion. Clover tells her she is already doing so much. The sadness, anger, frustration is the internal alarm bell that something is really wrong, although people in power try to numb such feelings. “So eco-anxiety is a really healthy response, right? It is evidence that you care.” Hogan thus calms the girl, who wipes away a tear. Marketing the film, Gameau over-sells how the kids confront corporate chiefs, because the only big companies that agreed to be censured by sub-teen greenies were Nestle and ING Bank, plus an online session with sportwear’s Decathlon. ING was in the tent already, having banned lending to coal companies and similar CO2 villains. The others, especially Coca-Cola and Pepsi, wisely turned down this alleged opportunity. Note that Gameau’s film continually mixes up the valid case against plastic litter, with net-zero agitation and foolish denunciation of “plastics” per se, vital ingredients of modern living. Given the kids’ scripted questions, the execs were on a hiding to nothing: ♦ When your grandchildren grow up, do you think they’ll be proud that you helped finance global pollution? ♦ Why not try to sacrifice a tiny bit of the profits in exchange for long-term sustainability? ♦ What are you and your foundation doing to ensure climate justice? ♦ What would you prefer: to have a greener future, or to have a future that still has fossil fuels and bad gasses? I don’t want to knock any kid’s sincerity and passion but it’s Gameau, not me, setting them up for crusading to classrooms. And the kids’ parent or guardian who came along for the ride were fine with their kids fronting Gameau’s polemic. The kids’ tussle with Nestle’s PR global chief Rob Cameron in Switzerland is the film’s climax, supposedly illustrating Gameau’s “Future Council” of wise and righteous adolescents. I can see how Nestle’s Cameron got seduced in. He’s been a green activist for 25 years and joined Nestle in 2020 from his CEO and managing partner role at global think tank SustainAbility. He runs Nestle’s ESG (‘environment, social, governance’) efforts and helps run its Net Zero Roadmap. About the time when Gameau’s troop monstered him, he became chair of the International Chamber of Commerce’s Global Commission on Environment and Energy. The kids, doubtless geed-up by their adults, saw him as the culprit for plastic litter. Relaxed in his open-neck sky-blue shirt, he tried to explain that without high-tech packaging, Nestle foods would degrade, especially ageing on small-shop shelves in the tropics. He hinted that green-friendly packs might let in human-unfriendly bugs. Skye from Wales, congratulated later by Gameau for her ‘bad-ass’ speeches, was having have none of it. Channelling Greta Thunberg’s ‘How dare you!’, she read from her script: I sat in front of a powerful leader and listened to your empty words and empty promises. Plastic is everywhere. It’s in our seas and our rivers, on our beaches and mountains, in our food and even in our blood. They proudly tell us that Smarties can be a completely sustainable paper tube, whilst you churn out over five billion plastic wrapped KitKats every single year. You’re the third biggest polluter on the planet. You are not a powerful leader. You are a disgrace. She finished with a Thunberg-like glower and then a little grin, while Gameau’s score swells and he inserts a clip of Skye collecting plastic litter to show she’s a good kid. Serves silly Cameron right for trusting the movie project in the first place. The lamestream-media reviews rhapsodise about Skye leaving Cameron “speechless”. In fact he recovered swiftly from brat-attack and his response was a model of kindness: Sorry you think that. Truly. You’re right that the company has a lot of impact. And when it comes to great responsibility, I and other folk in the business all care passionately about the world we live in. I’m a father. We love our children. I don’t want to leave a [worse] world that my daughter grows up in. Companies [should] operate in an economy that knows its place within the wider ecosystem, we just lost sight of that. Not all the film’s humour seems intentional – one of the boys says, “A lot of the time kids aren’t listened to by adults. I’ve had some really good ideas for them. It was more about my bedroom, but…” Future Council , although days old, has already aged badly. The Net Zero quest is collapsing.[4] China, India and the US have opted out and Western Europe is convulsed with doubts, not that teachers would ever let kids know. Once-green asset managers like BlackRock ($US10 trillion) and Vanguard ($US9 trillion) have quit the Net Zero club to realign with fossil fuels. BP has ditched the revised branding and renewables theme from 2000, namely “Beyond Petroleum”. The re-brand supported renewables but has trashed BP’s share price. Facts and brainwashing aside, Gameau’s movie has plenty of charm with its exuberant storyline, family-friendly antics and great production values. Gameau has even allocated 75% of his producer’s profit share to the Future Council concept. For all that, the movie has arisen from the ideological swamp to the left of the Greens, as evident in Gameau’s political musings on his Instagram posts. When (not if) this movie invades classrooms, conservative parents need to start their own climate protesting. Tony Thomas’s latest book, Anthem of the Unwoke – Yep the other lot’s gone bonkers is available from Connor Court, $34.95 [1] Jason Kimberley of the Craig Kimberley rich-list family launched Cool in 2008. [2] AIMS for alarmism’s sake takes pains not to show the GBR’s total recent coral cover, instead splitting it into separate graphs for the northern, central and southern reefs. Dr Peter Ridd has simply combined the data as shown here to reveal the reef’s true health. [3] Clover Hogan was shocked to be invited to discuss “climate science” on a TV show, but “sharing the segment with a climate denier.” She upbraided the producer, who replied that since people like President Trump denied the science, the media had to reflect all views. Clover’s view was that the media should tell only “the truth” – adding, “Lives, policies, and the future of the planet depend on it.” [4] As the International Energy Agency puts it, “Despite efforts to reduce these emissions, the trajectory of CO2 emissions globally remains far higher than what is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

But we do have “Freedom of Speech” which allows you to say stupid (but not intentionally harmful) things. (I’m looking at you Al Gore and Micky Mann.) I will argue what Al Gore is preaching is religion, not science. I also posted a negative comment about AG in this thread. Inconvenient truth etc are truly shameful. But man, what a great growly oratory voice he has. Gore failed out of divinity school. But he does have that camp meeting aura. If I can’t cast (rhetorical) stones at evil, then how will the good be defended? Hey teacher! Leave those kids alone! The trouble is, they’re not just another brick in their walls, more of an RSJ… My thought exactly!! Thank goodness I grew up before climate even existed. The first I heard of climate in the classroom was when I was in college. Then it was that we were heading into an ice age. Ah, for the good old days. My indoctrination was a luncheon speech in 2021 to a group of us retired managers by an Emeritus polymath professor from the University of Rochester, who to keep busy in his retirement was helping his friend Richard Lindzen of MIT analyze data concerning the alleged Global Warming crisis. Without going into any detail, what got me hooked was his clear demonstration of the logic chain (with probabilities) you would have to accept in order to believe we were facing a crisis. My next steps were WUWT and Bishop Hill. No turning back after that. Bishop Hill? WUWT? Bishop Hill – long dead UK sceptic blog WUWT – abbreviation for… look at the top of the page, If you want to get some real info to chew on, try Steve McIntyre’s “Climate Audit” blog. He was upfront and center during the Climategate scandals. It’s astounding. College students were required to read “Population Bomb” when it came out. Again… environmental science and ecology majors should be required to read the original edition _today_. Lots of YouTube videos now about the horror of population collapse. That, and the horror of AI destroying all middle class jobs. Apparently, people always need something to fear and that allows grifters to exploit that potential for fear. The kids in the film do come to realise that there are some really good humans who care about the planet and who have children and who are working in these massive corporations. There are “some,” he says. Yes, and there are some who use their children as props for their own politics. Hopefully these children will gain balanced and productive thinking from mentors they will have later in life. For others it will be too little too late probably. Or they will find mentors who make things worse. I think real data will confirm that there are a LOT of “good humans” who “care about the planet” while rejecting the assumptions and solutions alarmist preach. What I don’t understand is that most people don’t realize that if you accept someone’s false (and undefined) PREMISE on faith, they then can get you to accept any ridiculous CONCLUSION. ...”live in a polluted world” – what pollution, and once you define what “pollution” you are talking about, where do I go for data to confirm your allegation?!? Until then, stop preaching about solutions to your imaginary problems. (I’m too busy preparing for the imminent invasion of leprechauns to the US!) “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities” – Voltaire This is child abuse. Nothing less. You took the words right out of my mouth Useful idiots doing the Marxists bidding. The Marxists are playing the long game and now starting with indoctrinating our children. “Conspiracy theory”? Bit by bit, inch by inch, they are introducing their ideology without showing their faces. Do they even teach anymore that without CO2 we wouldn’t have any plants growing and producing food to eat and oxygen for us to breath? The Marxists are playing the long game and now starting with indoctrinating our children. __________________________________________________________________________ NOW?? They’ve been at for as long as I can remember, and I have a 1944 DOB. Yup. I can attest that the process started before USA HS class of 1992. I was wondering … will this turn out to be a product by a raging alcoholic’s fever dream like the 2004 movie by Morgan Spurlock who turned out a docudrama called “Super Size Me” wherein practically everything in the movie was/is a lie? Notable are the comments (in the video below) from people (kids in school at the time) who saw Super Size Me at their schools (in 2004) and called out their teachers for the ridiculous premise Spurlock based the film on -the over eating of jumbo portions of fast food- and the effects on his body which INCLUDED (but not revealed in the film) his alcoholism (which was only admitted-to years later by Spurlock.) Kids are not always so easily fooled it seems. Maybe that will happen with this effort too (a revelation years after the film is out and the kids will toss out the premise.) Supersize Me: How Documentaries Lie But, but, but… You can’t be saying that someone as altruistic as Al Gore would lie to us, can you…? The smart ones will “get it”. They have instilled indoctrination into the schools crowding out some of the needed reading, writing, arithmetic studies. It is a nation in decline. I wonder if this Gameau dude is going to take his act to Chinese schools, noting that they are the biggest emitter? I suspect not. I think in almost all countries where there is an education establishment, it’s leftist. And although the left does not believe in God, they have taken at least some of the wisdom in the Bible to heart, applying propaganda and indoctrination from an early age: Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. — Proverbs 22:6 Not sure what you mean by leftist, but in western countries the educational establishment was the Church. And, following the French example, the reaction to the Church was the alternative educational establishment. As the State and RC Churches are defenders of orthodoxy, conservative power structures and the Establishment, the alternative has been leftist. Because they are the reaction to reactionary forces. The thing to do is mount an organization to show the kids they’ve been scammed by narcissistic adults. Adults who lie to kids for their own self-serving feelings of virtue. Net Zero as an expression of defective personalities. The whole green thing is clearly powered by character assassination. Time to do some character assassination right back. HEAR HEAR! to show the kids they’ve been scammed by narcissistic adults. They’re already predisposed to think that, might actually accomplish something! “…dark-green activist Damon Gameau.” A good fit for the title role — Here follows a marvellous wonder, which transpired in the town of Hamelin in the diocese of Minden, in this Year of Our Lord, 1284, on the Feast of Saints John and Paul. A certain young man thirty years of age, handsome and well-dressed, so that all who saw him admired him because of his appearance, crossed the bridges and entered the town by the West Gate. He then began to play all through the town a silver pipe of the most magnificent sort. All the children who heard his pipe, in the number of 130, followed him to the East Gate and out of the town to the so-called execution place or Calvary. There they proceeded to vanish, so that no trace of them could be found. The mothers of the children ran from town to town, but they found nothing. It is written: A voice was heard from on high, and a mother was bewailing her son. And as one counts the years according to the Year of Our Lord or according to the first, second or third year of an anniversary, so do the people in Hamelin reckon the years after the departure and disappearance of their children. This report I found in an old book. And the mother of the Dean Johann von Lüde saw the children depart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin TL;DR Learn to read faster. “The plot of Gameau’s 2040 is set in a future where renewables triumph over fossil fuels, vegans thrive, and every green brain-snap has proved a winner.” 2040-2025 = 15 years “The average retirement age for Australian teachers is around 65 years old, according to NGS Super” If I were king of Australia I would demand that any teacher who shows this movie before 2030 must also show the same, unupdated, unedited film after 2040 lest their retirement funds become void. The second biggest tragedy of Gore’s Inconvenient Truth was its popularity as USA science class filler the year it was released. The first biggest tragedy of Gore’s Inconvenient Truth is that it is not shown in the same classes today in unupdated, unedited form – the smart kids will “get it”. I believe it is a UK requirement that that piece of rubbish can only be shown in schools if preceded by a clear statement that everything in that film has been proven false. I agree wholeheartedly that we should embrace First Nations wisdom, especially that of the European First Nations who ushered in the age of enlightenment and allow humanity to grow out of superstitious belief systems empowering humanity to grow, nurture and shepherd the planet to support ~10 Billion humans and incredible biodiversity that exists. So, lets embrace the wisdom of the European First Nations people(s). Well expressed and dead on. Three full cheers for the Enlightenment! The problem, on all sides of all political debates, is that there is no risk management. In the real world, wherever accountable decisions are made, every choice must also consider what happens if the decision is not made or if it is made… and goes wrong. The probabilities are assessed and justified, the mitigating precautions are put in place (considering costs relative to the probabilities). And then, only then, is the decision made. In politics, the decision is made assuming that they have the absolute truth of the world; now, yesterday and forever. (Theologically speaking, this is warned against in the 1st Commandment. There is a reason it’s the very 1st one). “I’m 12 years old and I live very near the village of Fairbourne, destined to become the first climate refugees of the developed world. The entire village is built on a flood plain and due to rising sea levels, by 2050 it is due to completely flood.” No, Fairbourne is built on the medieval seabed. The A493 road follows the original coastline approximately 10m above high-water mark. The land now occupied by the village of Fairbourne, now in the county of Gwynedd but once part of the historic county of Merioneth, was until the mid 1800’s nothing more than a mixture of open rough grazing and salt marsh. The church & hotel occupy the only stable ground in Fairbourne, a holiday village built in the 1860s enabled by the coming of the railway. The land that comprises Fairbourne and lower Friog was formed by glacial deposits and built up sand deposited by tidal action. This ‘Northwards Longshore Drift’ over thousands of years built up the shingle bank that stretched from the Friog cliffs in the South across the front of Fairbourne, ending in a sand spit opposite Abermaw (Barmouth) on the shores of the Mawddach estuary. These same tidal conditions regularly shift stone and sand around and are responsible in part for the silting up of Abermaw (Barmouth) harbour and the mouth of the Mawddach. Further up the coast, Harlech Castle (1288), was built on the coast with a dock for supplies. Since then, Northwards ‘Longshore Drift’ has moved the coast ~ 1kM to the west ( a lot of the material coming up from Fairbourne). Harlech railway station is built on the old seabed next to the (now dry) castle dock, and like at Fairborne, the A493 road follows the original coastline. Here endeth the lesson (:-)) Error, … plus pics “and like at Fairborne, the A493 B4573 road follows the original coastline.” Sorry (:-(( Picture shows Harlech Castle dock at the rail/road crossing (bottom left) & the old coastline curving away (mid right). &f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d4701f35aebcd5ac7d5d3f5de9b9c73bab8aebfca41a7bd374a57c62e3478704 *** Fairborne, the old coastline is at the dark tree line, other side of the railway embankment. https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%2Fid%2FOIP.KrYS0ztadqsY4jKRn_11ywHaEI%3Fr%3D0%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=0ce68450207e4d5a6f0775bd81ac777d4592776123ceac52f226e5cb8fbbc733 Being taught what to think though emotionalism.

From Bitcoin milestones to DeFi growth, here are five bold predictions outlining crypto’s possible trajectory in 2026. Bitcoin could approach $198K, Ripple nears a $125 million settlement, and Ethereum eyes $15K. Memecoin ETFs loom and DeFi adoption accelerates, making 2026 a pivotal year across multiple sectors. In 2025, crypto markets exploded, with total market cap exceeding $4 trillion. Despite economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and regulatory concerns, crypto proved more entrenched than ever. Over the past seven months, institutional demand for cryptocurrency surged. Bitcoin [BTC] stabilized above $100k. Moreover, crypto-friendly policies and regulatory frameworks slowly emerged in the U.S. since the Election of Donald Trump. But what should we expect in 2026? Since dropping to a low of $74k four months ago, Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high of $124,517. It stabilized above $100k and has held it for over 60 days. Significantly, this uptrend was fueled by institutional demand and capital inflows through ETFs. Bitcoin’s Spot ETFs’ Total Net Assets hit approximately $150 billion, indicating massive demand. Source: CoinGlass Amid steady inflows, Bitcoin’s bull cycle may prove extended and exhausting. In such a case, based on the long-term power law, Bitcoin might reach $130k in September 2025 and close the year at $141.9k. Source: Bitbo In 2026, if institutional demand remains constant and macroeconomic conditions remain favorable, Bitcoin could peak at $198k. In the most bullish scenario, if BTC continues to rise at the same rate as it has over the past year, it might reach $211k. Ripple [XRP] became the breakout altcoin of 2025. Over the year, XRP soared ~620%, climbing from $0.50 to $3.60. Having said that, the surge was linked to U.S. regulatory shifts. Since 2018, the SEC had waged war on Ripple, eroding investor confidence. Source: X Now, with policy changes, Ripple’s battles appear near conclusion. Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the SEC would drop its case, while Ripple agreed to pay a $125 million fine after Judge Torres rejected a $50 million reduction. This resolution sets a precedent for future crypto cases and opens doors for institutional adoption, especially in cross-border settlement. If $5 breaks in 2025, XRP could rally toward $10 in 2026. While Bitcoin and XRP rallied at the start of 2025, Ethereum [ETH] plummeted, especially over Vitalik Buterin’s political stands. Yet institutions, whales, and ETFs returned strongly in recent months. At press time, Spot ETH ETFs managed ~$22 billion in assets. Also, ETH has become an institution’s favorite with Bitmine, Sharplink, and BlackRock aggressively accumulating it. In this case, we expect institutions and ETFs to push Ethereum to rally into a new all-time high. As such, ETH could retest $5K in September, climb to $8K by year-end, and average $9K–$10K through 2026. A cycle peak near $15K remains possible. This price uptick will be primarily driven by upgraded network and staking scarcity. As such, we expect the layer 2s of Ethereum to improve transactions and reduce costs, thereby making the blockchain dominant. Memecoins, especially Dogecoin [DOGE], have had a dismal performance in 2025 so far. The Official Trump [TRUMP] hype quickly dissipated once it emerged. This is because capital has massively rotated to Bitcoin, XRP and ETH. However, this doesn’t mean all is lost. Like other coins, market players have pushed for a memecoin ETF. As such, Grayscale and Bitwise applied for Dogecoin ETFs, while Canary Capital applied for Pudgy Penguins [PENGU] ETFs. In 2026, approval of a Dogecoin ETF or another memecoin could trigger fresh speculative frenzy. Amid a growing cryptocurrency market, adoption and growing support from major economies such as the United States, DeFi becomes closer to the everyday consumer. For that reason, it’s natural to expect traditional CeFi pools to integrate with DeFi, expanding borrowing, lending, and yield functionalities. Source: Grandview Therefore, in 2026, we expect the DeFi market to grow from its current $21 billion and surpass $30 billion. This will push the long-term projection towards $231 billion into reality as DeFi integrates growing AI. Looking at previous cycles, the crypto market continued to grow over the past decade with minimal drawdowns. Now, with a $4T market cap, crypto stands among the world’s top asset classes. And in 2026, the growth will continue not only for Bitcoin, but also for other altcoins and the broader blockchain ecosystems. As a result, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies will most likely reach $5 trillion and flip, becoming among the top global economies.

Title: Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin as best-performing asset over next decade

Time Published: 2025-08-20T18:42:46Z

Bitwise Asset Management expects bitcoin to deliver the strongest returns of any major asset class over the next ten years, projecting a compound annual growth rate of 28% with gradually declining volatility. The forecast was shared in a new memo previewing the firm’s forthcoming Bitcoin Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions report. The report, authored by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, is targeted at large platforms and professional allocators that are increasingly treating bitcoin as a “core” portfolio consideration. Hougan notes that the shift follows the launch and widespread approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have opened the asset class to mainstream retirement accounts and wealth platforms. Interest in long-term planning has grown markedly. Hougan said Bitwise received a dozen requests this year for long-term assumptions around bitcoin, compared with none between 2017 and 2024. In his view, this marks an inflection point: institutions are now evaluating bitcoin in the same way they assess equities, bonds, and other traditional assets. While the full report is yet to be published, the preview states that bitcoin’s projected returns, volatility profile, and correlations compare favourably with established asset classes. Bitwise characterises bitcoin’s correlations with other major assets as “low”, falling between −0.5 and 0.5, which many allocators value for diversification benefits. The asset manager’s positioning of bitcoin’s outlook draws parallels with annual capital-market forecasts issued by large Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan, PIMCO, BlackRock, and Vanguard. These outlooks help institutions determine long-term strategic allocations across asset classes including equities, fixed income, real estate, and alternatives. Hougan argues that similar guidance is now warranted for digital assets, given their growing maturity and integration into mainstream investment products. Since spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, they have quickly gained traction. On-chain holdings tied to these ETFs have grown to represent almost 7% of bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply, with assets under management exceeding $146 billion, according to data from The Block. Corporate treasuries have also expanded their exposure. Publicly traded companies, led by MicroStrategy with a holding of 629,376 BTC, have collectively accumulated more than $80 billion worth of bitcoin. These acquisitions have been financed largely through capital market activities, including equity offerings and convertible debt issuance. Bitwise’s full Bitcoin Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions report is expected later this week. It will provide detailed methodology and quantitative analysis, alongside side-by-side comparisons with forecasts for traditional asset classes from leading global asset managers. For Bitwise, the release marks a bid to position bitcoin within the same framework used for decades to evaluate traditional investments. For institutions, it reflects a growing acceptance of bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a serious allocation option with defined risk and return expectations.

Title: Liberty Steel: UK government prepares to take over plant

Time Published: 2025-08-20T17:04:56Z

The government is preparing to take control of the UK's third largest steelworks in a bid to save the business and protect 1,500 jobs. Managers have been lined up to take over Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) in South Yorkshire which is owned by Liberty Steel, a court heard. The future of the company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, has been uncertain for some time and it could be wound up over its large pile of unpaid debts. It comes after ministers seized control of British Steel, in Scunthorpe, earlier this year to prevent the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel from closing. SSUK is home to the UK's largest electric arc furnace which are more energy efficient and are thought to be pivotal in the industry's energy transition. But the company has faced financial troubles for sometime and has been unable to buy the scrap metal needed to produce steel after Liberty Steel's main lender collapsed and unpaid debts mounted. A High Court judge is set to decide the fate of SSUK. Liberty Steel mill 'basically derelict' - worker Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Sheffield under threat Lawyers for Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of GFG Alliance which owns Liberty, warned that a winding up order could mean the end of steel production at the plant. They sought an adjournment to allow him to complete an administration process for the company to then be sold, without the need for any government intervention. But lawyers for the creditors produced a letter to the court from the government offering reassurance that it would step in to take over the steelworks if required. Creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds petitioned a court to force the company into liquidation so that Liberty Steel's assets can be sold to pay the debts owed. Mr Gupta, whose firm owns a collection of businesses in energy, trading and steel, employing thousands of people in the UK, has faced scrutiny since GFG's main lender Greensill Capital collapsed in 2021. Sources close to the steel tycoon have confirmed reports that negotiations with investment giant Blackrock were ongoing to provide new funding to buy the business out of a managed or "pre-pack" administration. The judge on Tuesday expressed reservations saying there was no certainty as to what would happen to the company after the compulsory liquidation the creditors were demanding. "What happens to trading after the magic words are uttered?" the judge asked, referring to the formal granting of a winding up petition. "There is simply too much at stake." The case has been adjourned and referred to the High Court. While the government is a supporter of steel, it is not a big fan of Mr Gupta and has rejected his repeated appeals for direct government support. So the choice now is an unappealing one. Allow Mr Gupta to try and keep control though an administration â at considerable cost to the lenders whose loans would be largely written off - but zero cost to the government. Or help his creditors recover what is left of their money by taking on a loss-making steel plant for however long it takes for a buyer to be found and the sale proceeds dished out. The government said it would "continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for the company". "We are supporting the Official Receiver so that they are prepared to take the necessary steps should the company enter into compulsory liquidation," a statement said. Liberty Steel said it believed its "commercial solution backed by major private capital provides the best outcome for the business, its employees and all stakeholders concerned without cost to UK taxpayers or unnecessary uncertainty". A government intervention in Scunthorpe in 2019 cost the Treasury Â£600m during the 10 months it took to find Chinese buyer Jingye and since April, the government is back running day to day operations after it accused Jingye of planning to shut down its furnaces. The government has said its looking for a commercial partner but that nationalisation of the plant is the most likely option.

August 20, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global digital health in neurology market was valued at US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 229.5 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 21.8% during the forecast period 2025–2033. Digital therapeutics (DTx) are emerging as a powerful new class of medicine. These software-based interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic programs directly to patients. In the area of ADHD, Akili Interactive's EndeavorOTC is making significant inroads. A 2024 registry study revealed that 58.2% of its users reported having combined type ADHD. The data also highlighted significant comorbidities, with 69% of users reporting depression and 56% reporting an anxiety disorder. A remarkable 87% of users stated they had no to moderate symptom control with their existing ADHD treatments. For a quarter of users, difficulties in obtaining their medication prompted them to try EndeavorOTC in the digital health in neurology market. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/digital-health-in-neurology-market Another innovation, the Revibe smartwatch for children with ADHD, demonstrated its efficacy in a study with 706 participants. Children using the device showed a more than 25-minute increase in attention span after just three weeks. The study also recorded a 19% increase in on-task behaviors. Further validation for EndeavorOTC came from a 2024 study of 220 adults, which found clear improvements in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. An earlier 2021 study of EndeavorRx for children with ADHD showed that after two months, over two-thirds of the 206 participants' parents reported improvements in their child's ADHD-related impairments. Key Findings in Digital Health in Neurology Market Virtual Care Platforms are Erasing Distances in Neurological Patient Management Telemedicine is dismantling traditional barriers to neurological care with remarkable speed in the digital health in neurology market. Virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring (RPM) are now standard practice, offering convenience and enhanced oversight. A 2024 survey of pediatric epilepsy providers found 67.9% of their centers now use video visits exclusively for telehealth. A vast majority, 83%, believe these platforms provide more equitable healthcare access. The removal of transportation barriers stands out as a significant driver for teleneurology adoption in 2024. Projections show that by 2025, over 71 million Americans will use some form of RPM service. The utility of telehealth is undeniable. The 2024 study also showed that 92.5% of pediatric epilepsy providers use it for reviewing test results, while 96.2% use it to discuss treatment plan changes. The financial and clinical impact is staggering. The telestroke services market is projected to reach USD 1.99 billion by 2025, with cloud-based platforms dominating 85.3% of that market. A lifetime analysis of a telestroke program revealed an average societal cost saving of $1,526 per patient. Patients also experienced an incremental gain of 0.45 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A separate hub-and-spoke telestroke network model demonstrated a lifetime cost saving of $1,436 per patient and a 0.02 QALY gain. A 5-year model of one such network projected an annual cost saving of $358,435 for the entire system, with each spoke hospital saving an estimated $109,080 annually. Ultimately, implementing a telestroke program was associated with a reduction of 101 nursing home residents per 10,000 patients. The digital health in neurology market is clearly benefiting from these efficiency gains. Wearable Technology Unleashes a Continuous Stream of Actionable Patient Data Wearable sensors and mobile health applications are fundamentally changing patient monitoring. They provide a continuous flow of real-world data, empowering both patients and clinicians. The digital health in neurology market is leveraging these tools for proactive disease management. In Parkinson's disease, Rune Labs' StrivePD platform saw its user network expand by 56% in 2024. A nine-month pilot study of the platform involving 138 patients yielded impressive results. Participants experienced a 42% reduction in emergency room visits and an 18% reduction in time needed with movement disorder specialists. The behavioral impact was also significant, with 90% of users increasing their exercise levels and 80% showing improved medication adherence. Rune Labs' 2024 research is powered by a rich dataset from over 1,000 Parkinson's patients using the platform. The momentum extends to other conditions as well. As of 2025, the global market for epilepsy monitoring devices is projected to be valued at an impressive USD 582.3 million. Artificial Intelligence Is Driving a New Era of Diagnostic Precision Artificial intelligence (AI) is supercharging diagnostic capabilities within digital health in neurology market. Machine learning algorithms can analyze complex medical data with unprecedented speed and accuracy. For Parkinson's disease, a condition where early diagnosis is challenging, a new AI software called Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism (AIDP) has demonstrated the ability to increase diagnostic precision to beyond 96%. This is a monumental leap compared to the current diagnostic accuracy of 55% to 78% within the first five years. A systematic review of 127 studies on AI-driven Parkinson's diagnosis found accuracy rates consistently ranging from 78% to 96%. An experimental multimodal AI diagnostic framework achieved a 94.2% accuracy in detecting early-stage disease. A deep-learning model analyzing medical and prescription data from 820 Parkinson's patients achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.937 when using data from three years preceding diagnosis. When analyzing an even earlier period (3-6 years before diagnosis), the model's accuracy improved to 0.922 with the inclusion of medication data. The trend extends to other conditions, with the US FDA clearing the NeuroQuant 5.0 software, an AI-powered tool for assessing MRI scans of patients being treated for Alzheimer's disease. These advancements are a cornerstone of the digital health in neurology market. Immersive Virtual Reality Therapies Are Redefining Neurorehabilitation Possibilities Virtual Reality (VR) is creating highly engaging and effective therapeutic environments for neurological recovery. The technology is proving particularly useful for patients recovering from stroke, brain injuries, and amputations. In a groundbreaking clinical trial for phantom limb pain, a VR treatment requiring leg movements led to a 39.6% pain reduction among seven participants with lower-limb amputations. Even a distractor VR treatment without leg movements in the same study resulted in a notable 28% decrease in pain. This early success has prompted an expansion of the proof-of-concept study, which initially involved eight subjects with below-knee amputations, to a larger sample size. These immersive solutions represent a high-growth segment within the broader digital health in neurology market, offering new hope for patients undergoing difficult rehabilitation journeys. Digital Biomarkers Are Accelerating the Pace of Neurological Clinical Research Digital biomarkers are revolutionizing how researchers track disease progression and treatment efficacy. Collected via sensors and mobile devices, these objective data points provide a high-frequency view of a patient's condition. Their impact on clinical trial efficiency is profound in the digital health in neurology market. A trial simulation for a hypothetical Parkinson's digital biomarker showed it could lead to a 55.7% reduction in the number of subjects needed for a one-year trial if it detected disease progression just 1.5 times faster than standard assessments. The same simulation indicated that a digital biomarker with a 0.5-fold reduced standard deviation could allow for a trial with 70.0% fewer subjects per arm. Companies are actively building a presence in this space. As of 2024, Rune Labs, a key player focused on digital biomarkers for Parkinson's, had already participated in 15 scientific conferences to share its findings. Robust Investment and a Dynamic Competitive Landscape Signal Strong Market Confidence The financial community is taking notice of the immense potential in neurotechnology. Venture capital and strategic investments are flowing into the digital health in neurology market, fueling innovation. In 2024, European tech companies raised over €1.1 billion in seed funding, with total funding for startups reaching $51 billion. Healthcare and biotechnology was the leading investment sector, attracting over $11 billion. The median pre-seed funding round in Europe grew by 15.7% in the second half of 2024 to €870,000. Specific deals highlight this trend. In October 2024, iGent AI secured a €7.6M seed round, Nomos raised a €1.9M pre-seed round, and In Parallel secured €2.78 million. The competitive landscape is equally dynamic. Blackrock Neurotech received a massive $200 million investment from Tether in 2024, valuing the company at approximately $350 million. Its NeuroPort Array system, priced at over half a million dollars, has been sold to several dozen hospitals. Blackrock Neurotech's estimated annual revenue is $60.7 million, with an estimated revenue per employee of $306,778. Before the latest investment, the company had already raised $50 million and had seen early revenue grow from approximately $700,000 to $3.5 million. Meanwhile, Rune Labs announced a strategic $12 million investment round in 2024, bringing its total funding to $42 million. Its StrivePD platform is also being used in a care management program with Kaiser Permanente. Customize the Data Scope to Match Your Objectives: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/digital-health-in-neurology-market Evolving Regulations and Emerging Technologies Are Charting the Industry's Future The future of the digital health in neurology market is being shaped by evolving regulatory frameworks and next-generation technologies. Regulators are adapting to the unique nature of software-based medical devices. As of September 2023, Japan had approved only three therapeutic apps. To accelerate innovation, Japan's PMDA set a six-month target review time for priority Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) products as of January 2024. A new two-stage approval system for SaMD was also expected in 2024. Patient engagement is another critical factor. A Mayo Clinic study of its RPM program found a patient engagement rate over 78%. A latest report published in 2025 found that 62% of healthcare leaders in the digital health in neurology market believe Generative AI holds the highest potential for improving patient engagement. Indeed, a 2025 survey revealed 51% of people have already used Generative AI to help diagnose symptoms. Looking ahead, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) represent the next frontier. The global BCI market was valued at USD 2.3 billion in 2024 and is expected to soar to USD 4.5 billion by 2029.

Bitcoin ETFs saw $121.7 million in outflows on Monday and $523.3 million on Tuesday according to Farside Investors data, while Ethereum funds mirrored the weakness with $196.6 million and $422.2 million withdrawn on the same days. Fidelity's FBTC led the exodus with $246.9 million in redemptions, while Grayscale's GBTC shed $115.5 million and Bitwise's BITB lost $86.8 million across the two-day period. Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, told Decrypt that spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing outflows as investors "scale back risk ahead of the Jackson Hole meeting and Jerome Powell's speech on Friday." The latest withdrawals break momentum from mid-July through early August, when Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.7 billion in inflows at roughly $135 million a day. Otychenko attributed the selling to weak job growth combined with mixed inflation data that "left the Fed in a difficult spot, leaving the markets more uncertain about the path of future rate cuts." Net Taker Volume, which tracks whether buyers or sellers dominate exchange activity, plummeted to its “lowest point since December 2021,” indicating widespread selling pressure, he said. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's rallies since March have followed a weakening pattern, with "each breakout weaker, with smaller price moves and lighter trading volume." Dean Chen, analyst at Bitunix, shared similar sentiment, telling Decrypt the outflows stem from two main drivers: macro de-risking as "U.S. PPI came in hotter than expected" and issuer-level profit taking ahead of Powell's Jackson Hole speech. He noted that BlackRock's IBIT recorded zero flow, which "tells us this is more tactical de-risking than broad institutional exit." Konstantin Anissimov, global CEO of Currency.com, also remarked to Decrypt the outflows represent "a broad de-risking move rather than a problem with any single ETF." He pointed out that redemptions shifted from BlackRock and ARK on Monday to Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise the following day, showing "investors across the board are taking some chips off the table." Despite the substantial ETF outflows, Bitcoin's price is down just 1.5% on the day according to CoinGecko data, which Anissimov attributed to buyers using "$32 billion in stablecoin cash sitting on exchanges" to absorb the selling. He characterized institutional sentiment as "cautious right now, but not panicked," calling the movement "short-term profit-taking" rather than a fundamental shift. Markets now enter a critical waiting period as Powell's address approaches, with institutional flows likely to remain volatile until monetary policy clarity emerges.

Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, called this “a cautious price target” in an interview with CNBC at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. He pointed to supply-and-demand dynamics as the primary driver, saying “there’s just way more demand than the issued supply of Bitcoin, or the existing overall supply in the marketplace.” “I just think it’s a function of buying and only 450 Bitcoin being made by the network per day,” he told CNBC. In the interview, Scaramucci emphasized the “consolidation and institutional adoption” of Bitcoin over the past year, citing the launch of ETFs by firms such as BlackRock and the growing role of institutional investors. “If you went to a conference like this three years ago, it was mostly retail investors and CEOs working in the layer-one blockchain space,” he said. “Today, it’s lots more institutional investors.” Scaramucci predicted that much of this institutional investment “will likely go into the ETFs” as opposed to corporate Bitcoin investment vehicles like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a legacy tech firm which has built up one of the world's largest Bitcoin treasuries. Scaramucci has previously criticized companies that have adopted Strategy’s tactic of issuing debt to buy BTC for their corporate reserves. He argued that JPMorgan will choose to buy their Bitcoin via BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, saying “it's a very secure asset that people trust,” calling it the "purest link to Bitcoin.” This is currently the world's largest BTC fund as of writing. Scaramucci isn’t alone in issuing bullish end-of-year predictions. Earlier this week, institutional investor VanEck made a comparable prediction of Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by year-end. Scaramucci expressed a fairly bullish view about stablecoins, saying they will “bring a wave of technological innovation,” pointing to how they may allow users to avoid credit card fees and some of the other third-party fees which have historically been charged in the payments space. However, he was less optimistic about the prospects of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Scaramucci said he thinks CBDCs would be “too intrusive” from a privacy perspective, adding that he prefers dollar-based stablecoins. This is a view shared by his former boss, U.S. President Donald Trump.

New figures from the Central Statistics Office show that property prices registered monthly growth of 0.9% in June, the highest rate since November last year. Home prices across the country grew by 7.8% in the year to June, unchanged from the rate of growth the previous month, the CSO added. The CSO said the median price of a home purchased in June was €370,000. Today's figures show that property prices in Dublin - both houses and apartments - rose by 6.6% and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.8% compared with June last year. In the 12 months to June, the highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 8% while both Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin saw a rise of 5.5%. Outside of Dublin, house prices were up by 9% and apartment prices rose by 6.6%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the West (Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon) at 10.3%, while at the other end of the scale, the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) saw a 7.1% rise. The CSO noted that the highest median price paid for a home was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €190,000 in Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €780,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the least expensive price of €148,000. The CSO said that Dublin residential property prices are 5.9% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 21.8% higher than their May 2007 peak. Today's figures also show that a total of 4,029 home purchases were filed with Revenue, an increase of 13.1% increase compared with the 3,563 purchases in June last year and a 5.4% increase compared with the 3,824 purchases in May. Existing homes accounted for 76.7% of the transactions filed in June, an increase of 8.2% compared with June 2024. The balance of 23.3% were new homes, which marked a rise of 32.9% on the same time last year.

Commenting on today's CSO figures, Dermot O'Leary, the chief economist of Goodbody's, said that price inflation trends overall are heavily influenced by the second-hand market due to the share of total transactions. "Second-hand price inflation has exceeded new home price inflation for the past five quarters, with inflation in the new homes sector now modestly below wage inflation after a spike in 2022/2023 as construction costs surged," he said. Trevor Grant, Chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, said that the continued uptick in the rate of annual house price inflation will be a disappointment for would-be house buyers as it means houses are becoming more unaffordable for many of them. He said that ultimately, the biggest driver of Irish house price inflation is the shortage of homes coupled with the pent-up demand for housing and an expanding population. Mr Grant noted that the recent 35% increase in housing completions is encouraging, but housing completions are still nowhere near where they need to be. "The shortage of new homes available to private buyers means many first-time buyers are bidding against trader-uppers/movers, which in turn is driving up second-hand prices. It's becoming increasingly common for properties to sell for 20% above the asking price," he added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Could Rate Cuts Accelerate DeFi's $150 Billion Market?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/08/20/could-rate-cuts-accelerate-defis-150-billion-market/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T10:26:23Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The math is irresistible again. In 2020, Treasuries paid just 0.5% while DeFi yielded 8%. Speculators piled in, and institutions began testing with early pilots. But when rates broke above 5% in 2022, the flow reversed back to Treasuries. Now, with potential rate cuts on the horizon, the yield equation is shifting again. When the Fed cuts, traditional yields compress. DeFi rates, by contrast, are set by supply and demand rather than central bank policy, making them largely insulated. As Treasuries fall, the relative gap between market-driven DeFi yields and risk-free rates widens, making DeFi attractive again. The rate environment is shifting. Markets assign 83% probability to Fed cuts beginning September 2025, while Goldman Sachs forecasts three quarter-point reductions by year-end. As traditional yields potentially compress toward 3–3.25%, DeFi's market-driven yields could once again offer compelling spreads. The question isn't whether this recreates 2020's conditions—it's whether institutions will respond more decisively this time, given the infrastructure improvements and regulatory clarity that have emerged since then. During 2022’s crypto winter, digital assets collapsed by over 90%, wiping out billions. Yet most DeFi protocols survived and kept functioning. The resilience was tested again in 2023: Silicon Valley Bank, the backbone of the tech ecosystem with $175 billion in deposits, collapsed in just 48 hours, trapping $3.3 billion of Circle’s USDC reserves and briefly depegging the stablecoin. Yet while banks froze, DeFi kept running, and USDC quickly regained its peg once the FDIC guaranteed deposits. Today, this ecosystem holds just under $150 billion in TVL (total value locked). The infrastructure has endured exchange implosions and regulatory crackdowns. DeFi’s resilience is drawing fresh institutional interest, with Wall Street now paying closer attention. JPMorgan and Oliver Wyman call this “Institutional DeFi”—a model that merges protocol innovation with traditional safeguards and could drive significant growth. At its core, DeFi replicates traditional financial services without banks or intermediaries. It rests on five major pillars: staking, lending, payments, tokenization, and yield farming. Together, these pillars form the architecture of decentralized markets and explain where activity and returns are concentrated. Locking or staking tokens on a blockchain secures the network and earns steady returns. It is the crypto equivalent of a CD (Certificate of Deposit), with instant settlement and non-custodial control. Rewards, drawn from transaction fees and newly issued tokens, flow to validators, the independent computers that secure the network, who then share payouts with stakers. In practice, it feels like interest income, but the source is the network itself rather than a bank. Ethereum staking currently pays 3–4% through mainstream providers, while Solana offers 5–8%. Beyond staking, stablecoin lending ranges from 4% to 9% depending on the platform. These yields are set by supply and demand in decentralized markets, not by central bank policy. Bitcoin's proof-of-work design limits native yield options, leaving most strategies focused on Ethereum and alternative chains. The staking landscape is crowded, with exchanges, enterprise players, and specialized providers competing for mandates. Coinbase and Kraken exemplify the exchange-led model, managing tens of billions and continuing to dominate retail flows. Pure-play providers like Figment (34% share) and Kiln (27%) compete on size and enterprise ties, layering in compliance, reporting, and onboarding to command large institutional mandates. Similar strategies are visible across Blockdaemon, which serves enterprise and developer ecosystems, and Stakefish, which caters to a global validator and delegator base. Among them, Chorus One makes staking simple and secure across 40+ networks with no custodial risk and minimal technical setup. Institutional-grade and ISO-certified, it supports Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and other major blockchains. The company optimizes returns through strategies developed by its quantitative research team, while users gain competitive rewards on their assets. This fragmented landscape highlights both opportunity and risk, as institutions weigh proven execution against marketing promises. If staking is the baseline, lending is the next layer, turning idle assets into active credit markets. In DeFi, lending and borrowing feel familiar, but the middleman is gone. Investors supply Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana through protocols like Aave and Compound. Borrowers post collateral directly on-chain, and smart contracts handle the rest. Rates rise when demand surges and fall when it cools. The most mature lending market revolves around dollar-pegged tokens. By lending USDC, USDT, or DAI, investors earn 4–9% yields, driven by constant demand for dollar liquidity. Returns come from borrowers paying interest, not the blockchain. In practice, it works like a global money market: programmable, transparent, and outside the banking system. If lending unlocks credit, stablecoins move the money itself. Stablecoins are no longer limited to lending; they are reshaping payments. Stripe and PayPal now extend crypto features to hundreds of millions of users, while Visa pilots USDC settlement and JPMorgan clears blockchain-based transactions through its Onyx network. These developments signal stablecoins’ entry into the financial mainstream. Behind the scenes, they already power the rails: USDT and USDC settle trillions of dollars on-chain each year, fueled by trading, remittances, and cross-border flows. Their biggest impact is emerging in cross-border payments, long plagued by high fees, delays, and limited access. Crypto-native companies are pushing into territory where traditional payments simply can't reach: peer-to-peer transactions. Kraken has launched Krak for crypto and fiat transfers across more than 100 countries. Another example, Paymento is rethinking crypto payments with a non-custodial gateway, where transactions settle wallet-to-wallet without third-party custody. It supports stablecoins across Bitcoin, Solana, EVM chains, and Tron. Freelancers can create payment links while merchants access plug-and-play integration with real-time settlement. Together, these efforts are shifting payments from bank-dependent rails to always-on, programmable networks. Execution is uneven, but adoption is accelerating. Illiquid assets are gaining liquidity. Real estate, commodities, and even invoices can be tokenized, and once digitized, they can trade around the clock on global networks while generating yield from their cash flows. The result is new liquidity from previously idle holdings. The market is scaling quickly. On-chain RWA (real-world asset) value surpassed $24 billion by mid-2025, nearly five times higher than three years ago. BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, now holds more than $12 billion across six blockchains. Polygon, Franklin Templeton, JPMorgan, and Avalanche with KKR are piloting tokenized Treasuries and funds. At the application layer, collaborative programs are emerging to support tokenized ventures. Haven1, a security-focused layer-1 for DeFi and real-world assets, and yard[hub]’s web3 Growth Camp accelerator have launched a joint program that combines Haven1’s next-generation infrastructure, technical support, and grants with yard[hub]’s venture-building expertise to provide a secure, compliance-aware environment for emerging DeFi and RWA projects from the outset. Despite this momentum, the gap between ambition and proven institutional adoption remains wide, and ultimate success will depend on execution rather than marketing. Yield farming means placing crypto into DeFi platforms as liquidity so others can trade, borrow, or lend. In return, investors earn a mix of trading fees and bonus tokens. It works like renting out your assets: rewards can be high, but they are risky since they depend on market activity and incentives that can shift quickly. Funds are usually flexible, though some platforms offer extra rewards for longer commitments. But whether staking, lending, or farming, none of it matters without secure storage and institutional-grade safeguards. On the consumer side, wallets have progressed from Trezor’s open-source devices for early adopters to Ledger’s millions of hardware units and MetaMask’s 100 million browser users. Each lowered barriers but stopped short of mass adoption. Tangem, a newer player in the crypto wallet industry, offers credit card-shaped devices and aims to onboard the next billion users by eliminating reliance on seed phrases. However, even with complexity out of the way, form factor alone cannot overcome user inertia and the broader challenges of education and trust that have long held back widespread adoption. At the institutional end, custody has matured into a layered system. Fireblocks, BitGo, and Coinbase Prime add safeguards like multi-signature security, compliance reporting, and insurance—bringing DeFi yields closer to fiduciary standards. They make staking, lending, and asset management viable at a scale regulators can live with. Regulation is catching up. Compliant, audited protocols are winning institutional approval, while experimental platforms face uncertainty. Europe’s MiCA rules and US stablecoin guidance raise costs but provide clarity. For institutions, the trade-off is simple: pay more for compliance and buy legitimacy, trust, and access to the market. These services effectively make digital asset management align with the expectations of traditional fiduciary oversight. The first wave of DeFi delivered both innovation and chaos. Many platforms kept customer funds in custody, allowing operators to rehypothecate—re-lend or make leveraged bets with user assets. When those bets went bad, the results were catastrophic. Terra Luna, Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager each collapsed almost overnight, erasing billions and shaking investor trust. The key distinction lies between truly decentralized protocols like Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and MakerDAO, which continued operating throughout the crisis, and centralized platforms that collapsed. Users keep control of their assets, with transactions executed automatically by code. User experience has leapt forward, too. What began with clunky browser extensions and jargon is now mobile-first, with fiat on-ramps, clean interfaces, and recovery via MPC or smart-contract wallets. The ecosystem has been stress-tested through brutal drawdowns and long crypto winters. Managing risk is central to any portfolio, and DeFi is no different. Investors must weigh not only macro and industry factors, but also risks unique to decentralized markets. Technical risk: DeFi hacks still cost millions every month, but platforms that undergo audits and offer bug bounties get hacked much less often. Market risk: Terra's 2022 implosion erased $60 billion in days and even shook Tether's peg—without circuit breakers, cascades spread instantly. Operational risk: Malicious insiders still pose threats—$95 million disappeared across 17 insider attacks in 2024. The crucial difference: non-custodial protocols eliminate the rehypothecation risk that destroyed Celsius and BlockFi. Users maintain control of their assets, with transactions executed automatically by code rather than human discretion. Regulatory uncertainty: Europe's MiCA framework went live in January 2025, requiring crypto service providers to obtain licenses or face an 18-month transition deadline. But Europe isn't done; targeted DeFi regulation is coming by 2026, though regulators still haven't defined what "decentralization" actually means. Meanwhile, US regulatory clarity remains fragmented despite new pro-crypto leadership, creating a compliance maze for institutions operating globally. Remember: if you can't identify the source of exceptional returns, you probably haven't identified the risk. Unlike traditional banking institutions, DeFi protocols can't call the Federal Reserve for emergency liquidity. When markets freeze and there's no backstop, cascades can turn into floods instantly, triggering catastrophic collapse. As Fed cuts squeeze traditional yields, DeFi’s yields could offer a 200–400 basis point premium over Treasuries. Institutional DeFi could represent a structural source of alpha, albeit with higher risk, built on infrastructure that has survived stress tests and reinforced by regulatory frameworks now crystallizing. For institutional portfolios, this creates three actionable opportunities: infrastructure exposure through vetted staking and custody providers; yield enhancement via compliant protocols offering market-driven returns; and early positioning in the payment rails that will underpin tomorrow’s financial system. ‘We’ve been emphasizing for years the need for the large institutional market, where most of the world’s value currently resides, to flow into the blockchain industry. We’re now helping facilitate this shift in a reliable, technical, and secure way,’ said Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink. With nearly $150 billion already locked, the rails are in place. The question is not if institutions will step in, but how quickly they will build the conviction to do so. Disclosure: The companies mentioned represent examples of different strategic approaches within each infrastructure category. Inclusion does not constitute endorsement, and institutional adoption timelines across all providers remain uncertain.

Title: Property values up 8pc in June as prices have now risen for almost two years

Not enough homes are being built to satisfy demand. Property prices rose again in June, with the cost of homes going up every month now for close to two years. Prices were up by 7.8pc in the year to June, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said. This the same rate of property-price inflation that was recorded in May. New CSO figures come on the back of a recent report from Daft.ie, which found that Irish house price inflation has reached a 10-year-high. In the year to June, the typical, or median, price of a home was €370,000, the same figure that was recorded in the previous month. The cost of a typical home is now up by €35,000 since June last year. The June figures for the property price index from the CSO represent the 22nd month in a row in that prices have risen, putting huge squeeze on first-time buyers and movers. Second-hand home prices are increasing by more than double those of new homes. A chronic shortage of new homes to buy means many first-time buyers are bidding against trader-uppers and movers. This is driving up second-hand prices. In the three-month period up to June, new home prices were 4.2pc higher than in the same quarter last year, the CSO said. Prices of second-hand homes in the second quarter of this year were 8.8pc higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.6pc in June, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.8pc compared with June last year The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to June was €370,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94, which takes in Blackrock, Co Dublin. It had a median price of €780,000. The F45 Eircode, which takes in Castlerea, in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In June 2025, 4,029 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.7bn. These purchases were made up of 3,092 existing dwellings and 937 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June. The regions outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices were the West, consisting of Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon, at 10.3pc The Midlands saw price growth of 10.2pc. At the other end of the scale, the South-East area that takes in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford, saw a 7.1pc rise in house prices. Senior underwriter at Núa Money Donal Magee said: “House price inflation continues to pick up in Ireland, which has increased by 7.8pc in past 12 months to June 2025.” He said this means many people will continue struggle to buy a home. Recently, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there will be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said Government targets set to be missed in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels mean the outlook for housing remains bleak. ESRI research professor with the ESRI Conor O’Toole said these factors, coupled with the out-turn for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, mean the group does “not foresee any major uptick in 2025 and 2026 in housing supply”. He said the ESRI is currently forecasting 33,000 units in 2025 and 37,000 units in 2026, which would be well below Government targets of 41,000 this year and 43,000 next year. Furthermore, Mr O’Toole added most of the risks “weigh on the downside”. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Harvard Owns IBIT. Is That Smart for Clients?

Crypto assets are increasingly available as spot ETFs like IBIT, and investors may have a fear of missing out, despite the volatility. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Should financial advisors and their clients follow the “smart money?” Recently, Ivy League schools including Harvard University and Brown University have disclosed that they are among the numerous institutional investors with allocations to bitcoin ETFs. That trend is further legitimizing crypto as an asset class and may have some individual investors wondering if they, too, should bank on bitcoin. Financial advisors have different stances on whether (and how much) clients should allocate to the highly volatile category, but they agree that it should be approached with caution. For example, most of AE Advisors’ clients have 5% to 10% allocated to Bitcoin via spot-price ETFs or digital custodians, president Mike Casey said. But Casey, who said he was among the first CFPs to recommend bitcoin allocations as far back as 2019, added, “please keep in mind that bitcoin has substantially more market cap and mainstream adoption than the other crypto tokens, which are still generally speculative in nature.” Retail demand is obviously there for spot crypto products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETFs (IBIT), which is approaching $90 billion in assets. But the extent to which advisors use certain products is influenced in part by their inclusion in model portfolios — and spot crypto ETFs are almost nonexistent there. “BlackRock is really the only one we’ve seen going forward with adding it into its model portfolios,” said Cindy Zarker, relationship manager at Fuse Research Network. “All of this is changing. You have a lot of firms that have various digital-asset offerings, and they’re promoting those offerings and how they can benefit a portfolio.” There are signs that digital assets are maturing, said Clark Randall, director of financial planning at Creekmur Wealth Advisors. Those include BlackRock’s launch of IBIT and Congressional passage last month of the Genius Act, he said. “In addition, research has shown that including an allocation of up to 7% in Bitcoin can improve the risk-adjusted return of a diversified investment portfolio.” Still, if more advisors are bullish on Bitcoin, it’s a new phenomenon. Data from a survey last year published by Fuse show: Time for Class: “Institutional interest from endowments and other large investors lends credibility to the ETF structure because it is regulated, custodied and easy to report for taxes,” said Jared Gagne, private wealth manager at Claro Advisors. “It does not make crypto less volatile. In wealth management, that distinction matters.” Institutions have more time to weather that volatility than individuals, and allocations for clients should be satellite holdings at most, said Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning. “The average individual investor can’t invest with a truly infinite time horizon and is more exposed to urgent liquidity needs, emotional stress and the risk that riding out a 70% crypto correction isn’t just uncomfortable, but catastrophic to their plans.” ETF volatility plays a large role in the gap between returns for investors and for funds as a whole, Morningstar data show. A set of Vanguard funds subadvised by Wellington will mark the first active stock-picking ETFs in the company’s fleet. Energy demand is rising globally, in part because of AI use, and a handful of ETFs focused on nuclear energy stand to benefit. Cyclical industries can provide some regularity for ETF investors, but not without downsides. The filing marks President Trump’s latest move to bring his spot bitcoin strategy to the ETF market. Will advisors bite? Following revised jobs reports data, Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics head. His successor choice at the BLS may raise red flags. Investments in AI infrastructure are set to take off in the next decade, and more ETFs are focusing on that. Finance pros say US stock prices are higher than they should be, but that may have a lot to do with the biggest names in the S&P 500. The past year hammered active funds, and while a few categories show long-term promise, success is out of reach for most, per Morningstar. The agency declared it is hands-off for liquid staking in some cases, which could eventually help crypto ETFs benefit from proof-of-stake. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, a standard ETF portfolio may not cut it. A backlash to so-called woke investments spurred interest in their anti-woke counterparts. But is it a new strategy or just marketing hype? © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: In Ukraine, the ‘Buts’ Win in the End

I love you, BUT I’m not “in love” with you. You don’t have to go home, BUT you can’t stay here. You may continue fighting, Martial Law President Zelensky, BUT the American people won’t be following you into World War III. No matter how agreeable the first half of a sentence might sound, the “buts” change everything on a dime. President Trump has been clear that he wants the Russia-Ukraine War to end, but he says Zelensky must choose to end the conflict. When the war began, 73% of Ukrainians wanted to fight Russia until Ukraine secured victory, but 69% now want the war to end as soon as possible through negotiations! Perhaps that is why Z-Man agreed to meet President Trump in D.C. It was widely rumored that U.S. officials encouraged the battledress-wearing comedian to don a real suit for the occasion, but the holdover-president wore a military-style jacket in all black. The guy who plays piano with his penis still looks out of his element at the White House, but he does dress like someone attending his own funeral. With the titular head of the Ukrainian government back at the White House — surrounded by an entourage of European honchos eager to butt in — we will finally discover whether some kind of peace between Russia and Ukraine is tenable. To be sure, there are many powerful people in the United States and across Europe who would prefer to keep Ukraine a battlefield for years to come. Why? As a man holding onto the presidency eighteen months beyond his elected term, Zelensky might finally bring peace to his war-torn country, but he will likely be voted out of office once the exigencies of martial law disappear. U.K. prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen may publicly express their desire for lasting European peace, but the Russian bogeyman has long been the perfect scapegoat and distraction for European societies self-immolating from mass immigration, censorship, and “climate change” communism. The World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and other august organizations ostensibly dedicated to global welfare might applaud an end to bloodshed, but all of their depopulation enthusiasts will no doubt regret the loss of a conflict zone chalking up more deaths than births. BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other international investment houses will be happy to make money from lucrative rebuilding projects in Ukraine, but they will lament that the war did not topple President Putin and open up Russian lands to their profit-seeking conquest. Weapons manufacturers will be glad to have so much demand from American and European militaries desperate to restock munitions after years of supplying Ukraine, but their boards of directors will be busy finding new places around the globe to slaughter in the cutthroat business of war. So there may well be happy faces and cheers over the next few days and weeks when it comes to the prospect of Ukrainian peace, but there will be plenty of villains scowling behind the scenes — all hoping that the tentative peace breaks and the carnage resumes. Those European and Chinese power-players who have long seen war between the Russian Federation and the United States as an opportunity to diminish both countries simultaneously will say all the right things in upbeat social media postings praising compromise, but they will regret that the America-last Biden administration is no longer around to stumble recklessly into nuclear war. Spy agencies across the West may pause their “color revolution” activities long enough to install a new Ukrainian puppet into the presidency, but they will continue their hybrid warfare operations in former Warsaw Pact countries. London and New York City bankers will perhaps allow Russian citizens to access their overseas assets once again, but Western central banks will pursue monetary policies that cause enough domestic turmoil in target countries to return the West to a state of war in the near future. In sound bites, everyone loves peace, but in the world of big business, war means profits. War is big business, but it is also a convenient political distraction. During the destructive interregnum of the Biden installation, Democrats laundered trillions of dollars in “Green New Deal” spending through the Build Back Better Act (cynically relabeled the Inflation Reduction Act to appeal to idiotic members of the press). While that legislation stole from taxpayers and accomplished nothing for the American people, it put enormous sums of money into the bank accounts of Democrat-run NGOs structured as “social justice” and “environmental justice” front groups. Combined with Democrats’ ongoing war against inexpensive hydrocarbon energies, the inflation-triggering money-printing of that harmful legislative handout to Establishment insiders and crony capitalists doubled grocery prices in the United States. How did Democrats explain away their disastrous handling of the economy to struggling American families? They simply blamed Russia (as they have for the last decade) and called the spike in the cost of living “Putin’s price hike.” Sure, the cost of food, fuel, and basic necessities rose precipitously during the bungling Biden administration, but Russia, Russia, Russia! Americans were even encouraged to view their growing household bills as a patriotic form of suffering worth enduring in America’s undeclared alliance with Ukraine against the Russian Federation. First, Democrats blamed Hillary’s 2016 election loss on imaginary Russian bots and contrived Russian collusion. Then they blamed the massive spike in prices on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Europe has played the same cynical game against its citizens. Instead of admitting that “green energy” totalitarianism is destroying the continent’s industrial competitiveness and household wealth, mendacious politicians blame the War in Ukraine for their crumbling economies. Of course, the rise in energy costs across Europe might also have something to do with ineffective sanctions against Russian energy companies (that merely divert Russian products to China and the greater Global South); the convenient sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines; and Ukraine’s military attacks on key pipelines transporting oil and natural gas from Russia to households in Hungary, Slovakia, and other parts of Europe. The more expensive ordinary goods become, the louder Eurocrats insist that the problem is not “green energy”–induced inflation but rather Russia’s war in Ukraine! For European politicians, the Russia-Ukraine War supplies many ancillary benefits. It provides already indebted nations an excuse to borrow more money for defense spending. It creates a common enemy for the European Commission to exploit as a life-and-death reason for member states to relinquish national sovereignty. It creates a distraction from the rising frequency of social conflicts related to rampant illegal immigration. It provides a pretext for canceling inconvenient election results in Romania and designating popular political parties as national security threats. It allows the prevailing Establishment to entrench its control over the European bureaucracy. As Democrats in America and socialists in Europe are fond of whispering, Never let a crisis go to waste. Turning Russia into an irredeemable bugaboo and Ukraine into some saintly bastion of “democracy” worthy of every European’s sacrifice is how we have gotten to the point when all of Europe’s problems are brushed aside. Serious people may be warning about a looming civil war in the United Kingdom, but Ukraine’s territorial integrity is all that matters. Churches in France may be burning down for unexplained reasons, but Russians are the real threat. The German economy may be fundamentally unsound, but military spending will create jobs. Americans and Europeans should want the killing in Ukraine to end, but there are just so many politicians and bankers who find that outcome disappointing. In all likelihood, this war would have continued for many more years. But, thankfully, the American people elected President Trump. Hat tip to Megan Draper, M.S. Image via Raw Pixel.

Title: Volkswagen Is Turning Engine Performance into a Subscription Upgrade

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/19/2025 9:39:59 AM PDT by packagingguy Volkswagen is now offering owners of its ID.3 EV hatchback the option to boost their car’s performance — for a monthly subscription fee. Instead of following the traditional model of offering improved performance through upgraded components, VW has locked its car’s true potential behind a software subscription. Auto Express reports that German automaker Volkswagen has introduced a subscription-based model for unlocking the full potential of its ID.3 electric car, a new model available in the UK. While the ID.3 Pro and Pro S models are listed on the configurator as producing 201 horsepower, buyers must pay a monthly subscription fee of £16.50 ($22.29) to access the car’s maximum output of 228 horsepower. This subscription, which comes after a one-month free trial, is nearly three times the cost of a standard Netflix subscription with ads. Owners can also opt for a lifetime subscription priced at £649 ($877), which remains tied to the vehicle even if it is sold. Volkswagen states that the performance upgrade increases the net power by 27 horsepower and the maximum torque from 265Nm to 310Nm without affecting the car’s range. As the ID.3 is registered at 228 horsepower from the factory, owners are not required to inform their insurance company about the upgrade. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

What to make of Vanguard’s moves to diversify from its core business of passive funds. How the hidden costs in leveraged ETFs eat into returns. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 19, 2025 Think of the Stock Market as Great Businesses—Not a ‘Hissing, Writhing Bag of Poisonous Snakes’ “And that’s the mother of all sort of hardwired human nature kinks that causes people to fail as investors. And what I’ve said to advisors is 85% to 90% of your job is that, is the management of that. You make a plan. You set goals once. Assuming the goals haven’t changed and don’t change, you make a plan once.” (Morningstar) Vanguard’s Push Into Active Is Anything But Passive “Aside from the active strategies, an obvious common denominator is the name Wellington. That would be investment firm Wellington Management, which was founded in 1928 and, in 1951, hired John C. Bogle, who would then go on to establish the Vanguard Group in 1975. Needless to say, Vanguard and Wellington have a history together, and the former is tapping into the deep well of asset management expertise in the latter to create these new ETFs.” (VettaFi) Leveraged ETFs: The Hidden Costs That Eat Your Returns “To most market watchers, the default explanation for long-term underperformance in leveraged ETFs is volatility decay, or the math that comes from these funds resetting leverage daily to match their target multiple (like 2x). In choppy markets, that reset can create a ‘buy high, sell low’ effect that steadily erodes returns compared with a simple multiple of the underlying’s long-term performance.” (ETF.com) BlackRock's Rick Rieder: This is the best investing environment ever “Rick Rieder, BlackRock global fixed income CIO, joins 'Closing Bell' to discuss Rieder's thoughts on the current investing environment, if the Fed will cut rates in September and risks to equity markets.” (CNBC) When ‘invest like the 1%’ fails: How Yieldstreet’s real estate bets left customers with massive losses “But Yieldstreet customers who participated in its real estate deals in recent years say they’ve learned the flip side of the private markets: They face huge losses on investments that turned out far riskier than they thought, while their money has been locked up for years with little to show for it besides frustration.”(CNBC) Alts Managers Face Skepticism from RIAs Over Private Credit ETFs “But vehicle familiarity among RIAs remains low, and asset managers looking to be early movers are having to invest in educational and marketing outreach.” (FundFire) How One Big Private-Equity Fund Makes Its Numbers Incomprehensible “Such funds should, at a minimum, allow investors to see how much each private-equity holding originally cost and compare that with its latest carrying value. Some funds are making this exercise difficult. This is particularly problematic in light of recent controversies over some of the industry’s valuation methods.” (WSJ) How Semiliquid Funds Became the Preferred Vehicle for Private Assets “Traditional and alternative asset managers have seized on interval funds in particular, which have familiar tickers, electronic trading, tax forms, and regulatory disclosures, as the preferred vehicle to offer private assets to regular advisors and investors.” (Morningstar) Amidst Tragedy, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust ‘Continues to Stand Strong’ “The firm recapped its year-to-date and overall performance – the first time since the passing Wesley LePatner in a mass shooting at the firm’s Manhattan headquarters. The board of directors has since appointed Rob Harper, a seasoned Blackstone executive, as interim CEO. The company also said it is drawing upon Frank Cohen’s extensive leadership experience as board chair and former CEO of BREIT during this period.” (AltsWire) AGM Alts Weekly | 8.17.25: Own the narrative “There were major moves that signal an important evolution in how investment firms and companies are looking to own the direct relationship with their community and customers. Companies recognize that in today’s world they need to go direct. They need to be their own media.” (Alt Goes Mainstream) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Aug 20, 2025 Aug 20, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Father-son duo Randy and Matt Price and colleague Matthew Kerns launch Houston-based Clear Trail Advisors after an 18-month review. August 19, 2025 A father-son duo has left registered investment advisor Steward Partners to launch their own shop on the Dynasty Financial Partners platform. Chairman Randy Price and son and CEO Matt Price have started Houston-based Clear Trail Advisors, which has $850 million in assets and a self-proclaimed focus on “the millionaire next door” or those in need of portfolios that can generate retirement income and leverage tax strategies. The Prices are leaving their Steward practice, which was called The Price Group, along with Clear Trail co-founder Matthew Kerns and four other staff members, two of whom were recently hired, according to Randy Price. “This has been an 18-month process,” Randy Price said. “We wanted to own our future, we wanted to own the client experience, and we wanted to own the ability to take care of the client because at the end of the day, that is what makes the world go round.” Randy Price was an executive managing director at Steward, an employee-owned hybrid partnership of independent advisory firms, for over seven years. Before that, he had an over 18-year run as a financial advisor at RBC Wealth Management. But he goes back to earlier in his career, when he was doing financial planning for executives at companies such as ConocoPhillips, General Motors, and Shell, as shaping the planning-first mentality of Clear Trail. Related:Deals & Moves: RIA Concurrent Stakes Asset Manager; Homrich Berg Now HB Wealth “Everybody today in our team that is client-facing has to have their CFP,” Randy Price said. “We don’t do investments before we do comprehensive planning.” Randy Price said he had considered moving to Dynasty years ago, but it wasn’t yet the right fit. Now, he said the team is ready to work within their model and focus areas, which include every client having a “family index number” that guides their financial plan. They will leverage Dynasty for back-office support such as planning tools, compliance, accounting and investment platforms. Randy Price also liked the peer group he would join at Dynasty, which has over 55 network firms and more than 500 Dynasty network advisors. “When you look at the people who have joined them, it’s a who’s who of Phi Beta Kappa in the industry,” he said. “To be in that group is a distinct honor.” In 2022, Dynasty sold minority stakes to Charles Schwab and private equity firm Abry Partners. In 2024, it announced a minority capital raise from BlackRock, JP Morgan Asset Management and Schwab. Clear Trail is looking to hire a director of financial planning and an in-house tax specialist. Randy Price said it also plans to hire more advisors interested in its model. Related:Mariner to Acquire $5B Institutional Consulting Firm “There are a lot of like-minded advisors out there that own their own practice and don’t want to go sell their business and give their clients away, if you will, to somebody they don’t really know, and they want a nice landing point for their career as well,” he said. “We’re building our new office with that in mind.” Randy Price said he sees himself working for at least seven to 10 more years, but expects his son and Kerns to continue what he expects to be a larger RIA by the time he retires. “As I look back, I feel like I’ve been somewhat of a franchisee over a number of years,” Randy Price said. “More and more people are leaving the wirehouses. ... the votes are that this is a much better space, a much better arena, a much better opportunity to do what we were called to do without the overhang of corporate influences.” Alex Ortolani Senior Reporter, WealthManagement.com Alex Ortolani is a New York-based senior reporter with WealthManagement.com with a focus on deals, moves and trends in the registered investment advisor space.

Title: Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks ahead of a storm, and could buy them back after it hits, top strategist says

Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks because he sees a storm on the horizon — and could buy them back once prices tumble, a senior market strategist says. The "Oracle of Omaha" has a "history of selling out of the stock market" when economic and financial indicators are "signaling a bear market or a recession is coming," Wedbush's chief investment strategist, Paul Dietrich, told Business Insider. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks for 11 straight quarters, even though the market has "soared" to new highs in that period, Dietrich added. The investor's conglomerate offloaded $212 billion of shares while only buying $34.5 billion, meaning its net disposals exceeded $177 billion — more than the market value of BlackRock or Boeing. Buffett also halted stock buybacks for the last four quarters as he no longer saw Berkshire stock as cheap, Dietrich said. The pause marks a big change from Berkshire's peak repurchases of over $20 billion in both 2020 and 2021. Berkshire's share sales and lack of buybacks have contributed to its cash pile, which more than tripled to a record $344 billion over the three years to June 30. Buffett has jettisoned stocks and gone to cash ahead of past downturns, Dietrich said. Berkshire grew its cash pile from around $11 billion in 1997 to $35 billion in 1998, and ramped up its net stock sales from $700 million in 1999 to $2.7 billion in 2000, ahead of the dot-com crash. The corporate titan had grown its cash pile to more than $70 billion when the financial crisis struck. It fell to about $52 billion by the end of 2008 as Buffett made a series of lucrative deals during the disaster. Berkshire ramped up its net stock purchases from around $5 billion in 2006 to $11 billion in 2007 as it capitalized on depressed asset prices. Buffett sounded cautious about the market during Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Dietrich said. Before his shock announcement that he intended to step down as CEO at the end of this year, Buffett bemoaned the lack of potential bargains as asset valuations continued to rise. Dietrich said the "Buffett Indicator" may be alarming the Berkshire CEO. The gauge, which compares the US stock market's value to the US economy's size, has surged to historic highs of above 210%, he said. That means the combined market capitalization of all actively traded US stocks is more than double the latest quarterly estimate of US GDP. Buffett once wrote that buying stocks at readings approaching 200% would be "playing with fire." The Wall Street veteran recalled Buffett's famous advice to "be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful," saying the Berkshire chief is preparing to pounce once valuations fall to attractive levels. Dietrich said Buffett would use his cash pile "to eventually buy back Apple and the other shares he has sold — but at a major discount —after the current nose-bleed stock market highs eventually come back down to earth." Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Startup’s Technique Brings Mathematical Precision to Gen AI

Highlights Neurosymbolic AI blends neural networks with logic-based reasoning to reduce hallucinations and improve trust in generative AI. Amazon and Imandra are advancing the approach in parallel, Amazon with warehouse robots and shopping assistants, Imandra with finance, code verification and regulatory compliance. Imandra’s tools, such as Code Logician, promise to slash error-prone processes with “mathematical guarantees,” according to the startup. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can astound with human-like conversation and research superpowers, but it can also be disastrously wrong. That unreliability is a major barrier to adoption as AI begins to control physical machines, payments and other high-stakes domains.

Δ Neurosymbolic AI is a rising technique that aims to solve the hallucination problem. It’s a hybrid approach that marries gen AI’s neural networks for pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning’s logic that can prove whether outputs are correct, with mathematical precision. The goal is to maintain the flexibility of generative AI while making its outputs trustworthy. Trust is a key factor for greater adoption of generative and agentic AI, according to a July 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report. While chief financial officers (CFOs) have warmed up to generative AI, they are still unsure whether they could trust agentic AI. Just 15% of executives are considering deployment. Neurosymbolic AI could help. Its roots stem from the early 20th century, when mathematicians developed ways to formalize reasoning using symbolic logic, laying the foundation of modern computing. Out of that tradition grew automated reasoning, a subset of symbolic reasoning that uses logic to prove the correctness of computer programs. Amazon has become one of neurosymbolic AI’s most prominent adopters, according to The Wall Street Journal. Its Automated Reasoning Group, founded more than a decade ago, built tools to verify security policies in the AWS cloud. Those methods now underpin new systems such as the Vulcan warehouse robots, which combine neural networks for perception with automated reasoning for precise planning. Amazon also applies neurosymbolic AI to customer-facing products. The Rufus shopping assistant, for example, uses large language models for conversation but leans on automated reasoning to ensure recommendations align with rules and policies. In August, Amazon announced an automated reasoning feature to minimize hallucinations, claiming it can identify correct model responses with up to 99% accuracy. “This is emblematic of where the field is going,” Imandra Co-founder and co-CEO Grant Passmore said in an interview with PYMNTS. “Fundamentally, just large language models on their own cannot be trusted to reliably reason. On the other hand, you have this incredible and hitherto underutilized field of AI — which is automated reasoning — completely built on logic, completely precise” and independently audited. See also: The Two Faces of AI: Gen AI’s Triumph Meets Agentic AI’s Caution Amazon’s automated reasoning group was founded by Byron Cook, its former distinguished scientist. About 20 years ago, he and Passmore crossed paths at Cambridge University in the U.K. In 2014, Passmore and Co-founder and Co-CEO Denis Ignatovich — a college friend who ran Deutsche Bank’s equities trading desk in London — founded Imandra to apply neurosymbolic logic to finance. Ignatovich’s constant concern was that a developer working on the trading system could inadvertently omit a line of code that causes the system to violate a regulation — and it becoming a big issue. At the time, Passmore was working on new techniques for reasoning in the U.K. “We realized we could actually commercialize this stuff,” Passmore said. “Finance needs it. Financial regulators need it, and finance can pay for it.” Founded in 2014 and incorporated in the U.S. in 2019, Imandra has raised $23 million from investors including Citi, Green Visor Capital, Albion, IQ Capital and Austin’s LiveOak Venture Partners. Goldman Sachs is a client, and Citi led its most recent round. One use case is automating the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol, which lets organizations send electronic trading instructions to each other, say from Goldman Sachs to BlackRock or the New York Stock Exchange. “Every computer in capital markets trading uses a version of this protocol, but everybody is allowed to customize it,” Passmore said. Typically, these quirks are described in 100-page PDFs. To connect, companies had to interpret the manual, build their own client code and then test repeatedly to make sure both sides can connect without errors. Imandra built a mathematically precise language for specifying the FIX protocol. Instead of relying on hundreds of pages of PDFs, clients can now use automated reasoning to ensure precise communication each way. “This very error-prone process at the plumbing level of the markets used to take sometimes upwards of six months” for a new participant to be onboarded, Passmore said. “Now they can be onboarded within three days with mathematical guarantees.” To scale its approach, Imandra launched Imandra Universe, a platform it describes as the first marketplace for neurosymbolic agents. Similar to Hugging Face’s repository for machine learning models, it hosts symbolic reasoning engines specialized in domains from geometry to logistics. A “Reasoner Gateway” lets developers plug them into agent frameworks, augmenting AI systems with logical checks. One flagship tool, Code Logician, targets the flood of AI-generated code. Once installed in coding assistants like Cursor, Code Logician builds a mathematical description of what the AI generated code is doing and use Imandra to verify it. Passmore said around 60% of AI-generated code contains bugs and Code Logician can make 96% of the code correct within three iterations. Imandra is expanding Code Logician beyond Python to Java and even COBOL, reflecting enterprise demand for code migration. It is also developing agents for geometry reasoning, among other pursuits.

Title: Exclusive: Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital to tokenize $300 million on Avalanche
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/19/anthony-scaramucci-skybridge-capital-tokenization-avalanche/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T14:00:00Z

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another investment firm is putting funds on the blockchain. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, announced Tuesday that his company plans to hold around $300 million from two funds in the form of tokenized assets. SkyBridge’s move comes amid a wave of enthusiasm for what the crypto industry calls tokenization. The process entails creating digital token versions of real-world assets like Treasury bills, which can be easily traded on a blockchain in the same way as Bitcoin or stablecoins. “I’m basically seeing 2026 into 2027 as the age of real-world tokenization,” Scaramucci, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had a brief stint at the White House during President Donald Trump’s first term, told Fortune. SkyBridge Capital plans to deploy its tokenized funds on Avalanche, a blockchain that boasts almost $2 billion in assets on its network, according to crypto analytics provider DefiLlama. The amount of money that SkyBridge will deploy is about 10% of his firm’s assets under management, Scaramucci told Fortune. One of the two funds he’s tokenizing specializes in investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have not been deemed securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to SkyBridge’s most recent investor disclosure. The other is a fund of funds composed of SkyBridge’s other investment vehicles, including both its venture and crypto funds. Advocates say issuing products like investment funds on decentralized networks can reduce transaction fees and cut out middlemen. Traditionally, there are a series of individuals between the buyers and sellers of financial assets, each of whom has to vet and evaluate the origin of, say, a stake in a fund—even if that fund is made up of cryptocurrencies already on blockchains. Each of these middlemen can charge fees and slow the process down. Blockchains are decentralized databases, meaning that no one party can tamper with the information stored on the network. Hence, there theoretically does not need to be a middleman to verify the owner and authenticity of a financial asset issued on it. Users can look up the details themselves. While proponents have lauded the virtues of tokenization for some time, the business of putting real-world assets on blockchains is still nascent, though it appears to be gaining momentum. Financial heavyweights like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck have recently issued their own money-market funds onto a series of blockchains like Solana and Aptos. Eventually, advocates envision a world where investors can buy and transfer their stakes in various funds without having to wade through spreadsheets or repeated calls to banks to wire money. SkyBridge Capital plans to partner with Tokeny, a company that specializes in tokenization, to put its funds on Avalanche. “Ultimately, we want to achieve two things,” said John Wu, the president of Ava Labs, one of the main developers behind the Avalanche network. “One is to bring activity on chain from the traditional finance world and also show the world that this technology can benefit them in terms of cost savings.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Softbank offers lifeline to Intel with $2B investment
URL: https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/softbank-intel-reach-2-billion-investment-deal-semiconductor-innovation/758041/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T13:18:00Z

Let Manufacturing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The deal coincides with unconfirmed reports that the Trump administration is considering a minority government stake in the semiconductor company. Japan-based Softbank Group will make a $2 billion investment in computer chip maker Intel Corp. as they look to deepen their involvement in advanced technology and U.S. semiconductor innovation, the companies said Monday. The agreement coincides with unconfirmed reports that the Trump administration is considering a minority government stake in Intel amid the company’s financial struggles. The Silicon Valley company reported a net loss of $2.9 billion in its latest quarter. It is also downsizing and cutting back certain initiatives in an effort to position itself for growth in the artificial intelligence era. As part of the investment, Softbank has agreed to pay $23 per share of Intel’s common stock, slightly discounted from its current share value on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions. Softbank is also collaborating with Foxconn to operate an AI server site in Ohio. “This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,” Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement. The deal would give Softbank a roughly 2% stake in Intel, making the investment holding firm Intel’s fifth largest stakeholder with 87 million shares. Blackrock and Vanguard are the largest, each holding a roughly 9% stake in the company, according to Yahoo! Finance. “Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement. In addition to Softbank, the Trump administration is interested in a potential 10% government stake in Intel following positive talks between the president and Tan, Bloomberg first reported. White House staff did not immediately return requests for comment. After calling for Tan’s resignation earlier this month over alleged ties to Chinese firms, Trump swiftly changed his tune, later posting on Truth Social that the executive’s “success and rise is an amazing story.” Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is making deep cuts as part of an overall revamp. It plans to reduce its core workforce to 75,000 by the end of this year, down from 99,500 as of Dec. 28, 2024. The company is also slowing construction of its $28 billion chip facility in New Albany, Ohio, and scrapping manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland, among other actions. Last week, Intel extended the closing date for the sale of its majority stake in Altera to Sept. 13. The deal is valued at $4.46 billion and would give private equity firm Silver Lake a 51% ownership in the programmable chip company. Approximately 82 workers are being laid off at Altera’s office in San Jose, California, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filing. Their last day is Oct. 8.

Title: Figure’s IPO filing marks Mike Cagney’s return to public markets

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Figure Technology, a 7-year-old blockchain-based lending company, on Monday filed for an IPO of its Class A common stock on Nasdaq, saying in its IPO paperwork that its revenue rose 22.4% to $191 million in the six months ended June 30, and that it reported a profit of $29 million in the same period, compared with a loss of $13 million a year earlier. The filing offers a chance at vindication for Figure co-founder Mike Cagney, who previously built SoFi before leaving the personal finance platform in 2017 following sexual harassment allegations. SoFi went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger and has done pretty well as a public company — its stock is up over 200% in the past year, and its revenue rose 44% in the second quarter of 2025. Since its founding in 2018, Figure has established itself as one of the bigger players in blockchain-based lending, claiming more than 160 partners for its loan origination system and capital marketplace. Figure claims to be the largest non-bank provider of home equity lines of credit. The company, which Cagney founded with his wife June Ou, uses blockchain technology through its Provenance blockchain to speed along approvals for home equity loans, mortgage refinancing, and student and personal loans. In May, Figure said it was also expanding into cryptocurrency lending, signing a financing agreement with Victory Park Capital for what Figure described as the industry’s first securitized pool of crypto-backed loans. That product allows asset owners to borrow against their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%. Terms of that deal with Victory Park were not disclosed. Cagney has a history of ambitious regulatory moves. As TechCrunch reported in late 2020, during the last days of the first Trump administration, Figure applied for a U.S. national bank charter that would have let it accept uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000 from accredited investors while avoiding traditional FDIC and Federal Reserve oversight. The approach could have established a template for other fintech and retail companies to obtain non-traditional bank charters and offer lucrative financial products while avoiding such oversight, but Figure withdrew its application last year amid broader fintech industry challenges. The company has undergone major leadership and organizational changes in the meantime. In April 2024, Figure appointed Michael Tannenbaum, former COO of Brex, as CEO. Tannenbaum previously worked with Cagney as SoFi’s chief revenue officer. And in an unusual corporate maneuver, Cagney spun off Figure Markets in early 2024, creating a standalone digital asset exchange for crypto trading, crypto-backed loans, and stablecoins. But just over a year later, in July, Figure reversed course and smooshed the two entities back together. The company says the strategy positions it to capture a huge and growing opportunity in real-world asset tokenization. (Real-world asset tokenization involves converting traditional assets like mortgages, real estate, or loans — even art — into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain networks. Heavyweight financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are among those who have recently entered the space.) It’s worth noting that this is not Figure’s first attempt at going public. The company previously planned to list via a merger with a SPAC called Figure Acquisition Corp., but the deal got scrapped due to rising interest rates and redemption rates, among other challenges. The blank check company was later delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Figure, whose backers include Apollo Global Management and Ribbit Capital, also failed to complete a planned merger with mortgage lender Homebridge Financial Services in 2022, citing regulatory delays 10 months after the tie-up was announced. The IPO filing is no surprise to industry observers. For one, Figure — which last raised $200 million in 2021 at a $3.2 billion valuation — announced weeks ago that it had filed a confidential statement for an IPO. Further, the timing aligns with a growing wave of crypto-related companies seeking public listings, encouraged by the wildly successful debut of Circle Internet Group back in June, and the Trump administration’s full-bodied support for the cryptocurrency sector and related legislation. Circle’s shares soared more than 500% in their first two weeks on the public market. Crypto exchange Bullish has added to the momentum as its shares more than doubled on its first day of trading last week. On Friday, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange Gemini filed for an IPO despite reporting a $282.5 million net loss in the first half of 2025. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities are serving as the lead bookrunners for Figure’s IPO. The number of shares to be offered and their price range have not yet been determined.

Title: Why yearslong bear market slumps may be a thing of the past

Time Published: 2025-08-19T09:30:02Z

Probably no other term strikes the kind of fear into investors that "bear market" does. The phrase invokes imagery of the 2008 financial crisis, the dot-com bust in 2000, and the 1929 crash leading into the Great Depression. In all of those cases, wealth evaporated in months and wasn't rebuilt for years. But is there really that much to fear anymore when it comes to bear markets, or declines of at least 20%? Sure, no one likes a significant market pullback, but if you stay invested, there's evidence that they may not be all that painful — and that the long, drawn-out, yearslong ruts in the market may be a thing of the past. That's according to Hank Smith, the director and head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust, which manages and consults on $15.3 billion of assets. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Smith laid out the main reason bear markets might be more short-lived going forward: A significant imbalance in the supply of shares on the market and demand for them. A few decades ago, the number of publicly listed firms in the US was over 7,000, he said. Now it's under 4,000. This number has also been shrinking relative to the US population. There are about 13 publicly listed companies per million people today, compared to 30 companies in 1996. At the same time, there is a record amount of cash — $7 trillion in money market funds — on the sidelines, he said. What's more, stock buybacks have been generally on the rise, lowering the supply of stocks available for investors to buy. In the first quarter of this year, there were $55.3 billion in stock buybacks. In the first quarter of 2019, by comparison, that number was $12.8 billion. In the first quarter of 2000, there were $7.9 billion. When there are fewer stocks available to be traded, prices tend to be more volatile. "There's been a real reduction in many companies of their shares outstanding," Smith said. "I think that's a big reason why you don't get these elongated periods of two to three years to recover from a bear market." He added: "It really is the result of supply and demand. I don't think it's much more complicated than that." Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said last week that this is the "best investing environment ever" partly due to this dynamic. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said in an interview with CNBC. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Alex Morris, the chief investment officer at F/M Investments, also recently discussed supply and demand dynamics with Business Insider. Despite a laundry list of risks to stocks — including the impact of tariffs and high valuations — the insatiable demand from investors for stocks likely means the market will continue marching higher, he said. "There's a lot of dollars floating around and they need to go somewhere," he said. "They're going to the equity market." While the sample size is small, there are a couple of pieces of evidence supporting Smith's theory, he said: the 2020 and 2022 market crashes, when the market fell 35% and 25%, respectively. In each instance, the market regained fresh all-time highs in a year or less. Of course, there were other factors at play, like unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in 2020 and the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. "This isn't like bear markets a generation or two ago that sometimes it took years to get back to the highwater mark," Smith said. "These bear markets are followed by very, very swift, powerful bull moves." Jump to

Title: Letters: Ukrainians just need to look to Crimea to see what reality of a ‘deal’ would be

Russian president Vladimir Putin wants to hold as much territory as possible. Photo: AP Just imagine this scenario. An aggravated burglary has taken place and your children and belongings have been taken. The leader of the pack agrees to stop assaulting you – if you let them keep what they have already taken. They may consider permitting you to install enhanced security measures in the future. Incidentally, life is hell for Ukrainians in Crimea. “Special measures” and tribunals have been set up to deal with any dissent. How did we get it so wrong? Daniel Smith, Blackrock, Co Dublin America is winning the war in Ukraine. Russia spends 7.1pc of its GDP on defence, double the US level. Russia has suffered a million casualties; the US arms industry is booming as Europe re-arms. Nato is buying US equipment to send to Ukraine. Russia has lost half its foreign income from oil and gas. The longer the war goes on, the more Russia is weakened and America is strengthened. John Doherty, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall Reports of Donald Trump’s Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, conducted not over hard diplomacy but filet mignon, halibut Olympia and green salad, ought to chill Europe more than amuse it. What is at stake is not the menu, but the spectacle of two men deciding the fate of Ukraine without Ukraine present (‘As Trump bows to Putin, Europe must prepare for the worst’, Irish Independent, August 18). The wider danger lies in the precedent. If borders and sovereignty can be redrawn in a dinner meeting, international law is reduced to table talk. The extrapolation is clear: once this becomes an acceptable mode of negotiation, other authoritarian leaders will be emboldened to test the same weakness. The prediction is bleaker still. A Ukraine carved up in Alaska may be only the first course. Moldova, the Baltics, even Taiwan, could follow as Moscow and Beijing take note of Washington’s willingness to appease under the guise of expedience. Europe, then, must prepare for the worst. To dine with Putin is one thing; to digest his terms is quite another. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Watching world politicians waffling reminds me of what the British parliamentarian Pitt the Elder said: “There is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.” John Finegan, Bailieborough, Co Cavan The recent death of actor Terence Stamp reminds me of his wonderful performance in the movie Far From The Madding Crowd. Sad indeed that fellow actors in that movie, Peter Finch and Alan Bates are also since departed. It’s nice to note that the female lead, Julie Christie, is hale and hearty at 85. Indeed by his own admission, singer Tony Christie was so impressed by her, that he adopted her surname. Is there a greater compliment? Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Fionnán Sheahan writes that should former minister Heather Humphreys decide to enter the race for the Áras, she might be called on to explain “why she stepped away from politics” recently (‘Heather Humphreys is a better candidate but Simon Harris is a liability to campaign’, Irish Independent, August 18). One thing is certain, the response from the Monaghan woman will be straight and true. The office of president is “above politics”. And rightly so. Though there are those who have lost the run of themselves while holding high office, causing no end of concern for our “ordinary” political masters, as well as for the people they represent. Another contender, it’s been widely reported, has expressed “distrust” of the UK, France and Germany ­recently. Not a great start for an aspiring head of State. The incumbent has been known to “cross the constitutional boundary” more than once during his almost 14 years in the Phoenix Park. Let’s hope the next holder of the “highest office” maintains some apolitical equilibrium, save for those times that necessitate presidential intervention. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan It was worrying reading last week that a study found that for under-18s with eating disorders there was a 121pc rise in hospitalisations between 2018 and 2022 – from 170 admissions in 2018 to 375 in 2022 – with a sharp spike during the pandemic. Eating disorders are complex ­medical conditions that not only affect the young person concerned but also their loved ones, family and friends. It strikes me that wraparound care is essential, requiring an increase in investment at a national level. Not every treatment will work successfully for every person that presents at a hospital, or is diagnosed with an eating disorder. If any reader, or professional working with young people, wants an insight into this issue, I strongly recommend Evanna Lynch’s memoir: The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting. It is a harrowing, haunting, honest and unflinching account, and yet a beautifully crafted read that reflects the author’s own journey with an eating disorder that she ultimately overcomes. Let us hope these figures do not continue to rise. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo The recent attacks on members of the Indian community are abhorrent. They are also, as noted by many commentators, puzzling, as the ­Indian community continues to ­contribute so much to Irish society. The fact that they are puzzling does not make them more abhorrent. All racist attacks are abhorrent, regardless of whether the target community contributes economically or not. Chants of “Get them Out” at anti-immigration protests may legitimise and encourage these appalling attacks. We all need to be careful with our language and not tolerate any racism, taunts, slurs or “jokes”.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/18/2025 8:33:53 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Quote of the week: “Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement, and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.” - Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman of Google. Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

In fairness - Tulips did NOT have a 17 year bull market, like Bitcoin did. On the other hand...

Second - what happens when the value of one Bitcoin no longer justifies the huge expense of verifying transactions? 7 posted on 08/19/2025 6:32:33 AM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple .

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book.

Yup—one major problem with Bitcoin is that anyone who owns any now has a conflict of interest if they recommend it to anyone else. That is one reason I cannot take the Bitcoin pushers seriously.
