The government is preparing to take control of the UK's third largest steelworks in a bid to save the business and protect 1,500 jobs. Managers have been lined up to take over Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) in South Yorkshire which is owned by Liberty Steel, a court heard. The future of the company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, has been uncertain for some time and it could be wound up over its large pile of unpaid debts. It comes after ministers seized control of British Steel, in Scunthorpe, earlier this year to prevent the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel from closing. SSUK is home to the UK's largest electric arc furnace which are more energy efficient and are thought to be pivotal in the industry's energy transition. But the company has faced financial troubles for sometime and has been unable to buy the scrap metal needed to produce steel after Liberty Steel's main lender collapsed and unpaid debts mounted. A High Court judge is set to decide the fate of SSUK. Liberty Steel mill 'basically derelict' - worker Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Sheffield under threat Lawyers for Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of GFG Alliance which owns Liberty, warned that a winding up order could mean the end of steel production at the plant. They sought an adjournment to allow him to complete an administration process for the company to then be sold, without the need for any government intervention. But lawyers for the creditors produced a letter to the court from the government offering reassurance that it would step in to take over the steelworks if required. Creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds petitioned a court to force the company into liquidation so that Liberty Steel's assets can be sold to pay the debts owed. Mr Gupta, whose firm owns a collection of businesses in energy, trading and steel, employing thousands of people in the UK, has faced scrutiny since GFG's main lender Greensill Capital collapsed in 2021. Sources close to the steel tycoon have confirmed reports that negotiations with investment giant Blackrock were ongoing to provide new funding to buy the business out of a managed or "pre-pack" administration. The judge on Tuesday expressed reservations saying there was no certainty as to what would happen to the company after the compulsory liquidation the creditors were demanding. "What happens to trading after the magic words are uttered?" the judge asked, referring to the formal granting of a winding up petition. "There is simply too much at stake." The case has been adjourned and referred to the High Court. While the government is a supporter of steel, it is not a big fan of Mr Gupta and has rejected his repeated appeals for direct government support. So the choice now is an unappealing one. Allow Mr Gupta to try and keep control though an administration â at considerable cost to the lenders whose loans would be largely written off - but zero cost to the government. Or help his creditors recover what is left of their money by taking on a loss-making steel plant for however long it takes for a buyer to be found and the sale proceeds dished out. The government said it would "continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for the company". "We are supporting the Official Receiver so that they are prepared to take the necessary steps should the company enter into compulsory liquidation," a statement said. Liberty Steel said it believed its "commercial solution backed by major private capital provides the best outcome for the business, its employees and all stakeholders concerned without cost to UK taxpayers or unnecessary uncertainty". A government intervention in Scunthorpe in 2019 cost the Treasury Â£600m during the 10 months it took to find Chinese buyer Jingye and since April, the government is back running day to day operations after it accused Jingye of planning to shut down its furnaces. The government has said its looking for a commercial partner but that nationalisation of the plant is the most likely option.

August 20, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global digital health in neurology market was valued at US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 229.5 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 21.8% during the forecast period 2025–2033. Digital therapeutics (DTx) are emerging as a powerful new class of medicine. These software-based interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic programs directly to patients. In the area of ADHD, Akili Interactive's EndeavorOTC is making significant inroads. A 2024 registry study revealed that 58.2% of its users reported having combined type ADHD. The data also highlighted significant comorbidities, with 69% of users reporting depression and 56% reporting an anxiety disorder. A remarkable 87% of users stated they had no to moderate symptom control with their existing ADHD treatments. For a quarter of users, difficulties in obtaining their medication prompted them to try EndeavorOTC in the digital health in neurology market. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/digital-health-in-neurology-market Another innovation, the Revibe smartwatch for children with ADHD, demonstrated its efficacy in a study with 706 participants. Children using the device showed a more than 25-minute increase in attention span after just three weeks. The study also recorded a 19% increase in on-task behaviors. Further validation for EndeavorOTC came from a 2024 study of 220 adults, which found clear improvements in ADHD-related symptoms and overall quality of life. An earlier 2021 study of EndeavorRx for children with ADHD showed that after two months, over two-thirds of the 206 participants' parents reported improvements in their child's ADHD-related impairments. Key Findings in Digital Health in Neurology Market Virtual Care Platforms are Erasing Distances in Neurological Patient Management Telemedicine is dismantling traditional barriers to neurological care with remarkable speed in the digital health in neurology market. Virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring (RPM) are now standard practice, offering convenience and enhanced oversight. A 2024 survey of pediatric epilepsy providers found 67.9% of their centers now use video visits exclusively for telehealth. A vast majority, 83%, believe these platforms provide more equitable healthcare access. The removal of transportation barriers stands out as a significant driver for teleneurology adoption in 2024. Projections show that by 2025, over 71 million Americans will use some form of RPM service. The utility of telehealth is undeniable. The 2024 study also showed that 92.5% of pediatric epilepsy providers use it for reviewing test results, while 96.2% use it to discuss treatment plan changes. The financial and clinical impact is staggering. The telestroke services market is projected to reach USD 1.99 billion by 2025, with cloud-based platforms dominating 85.3% of that market. A lifetime analysis of a telestroke program revealed an average societal cost saving of $1,526 per patient. Patients also experienced an incremental gain of 0.45 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A separate hub-and-spoke telestroke network model demonstrated a lifetime cost saving of $1,436 per patient and a 0.02 QALY gain. A 5-year model of one such network projected an annual cost saving of $358,435 for the entire system, with each spoke hospital saving an estimated $109,080 annually. Ultimately, implementing a telestroke program was associated with a reduction of 101 nursing home residents per 10,000 patients. The digital health in neurology market is clearly benefiting from these efficiency gains. Wearable Technology Unleashes a Continuous Stream of Actionable Patient Data Wearable sensors and mobile health applications are fundamentally changing patient monitoring. They provide a continuous flow of real-world data, empowering both patients and clinicians. The digital health in neurology market is leveraging these tools for proactive disease management. In Parkinson's disease, Rune Labs' StrivePD platform saw its user network expand by 56% in 2024. A nine-month pilot study of the platform involving 138 patients yielded impressive results. Participants experienced a 42% reduction in emergency room visits and an 18% reduction in time needed with movement disorder specialists. The behavioral impact was also significant, with 90% of users increasing their exercise levels and 80% showing improved medication adherence. Rune Labs' 2024 research is powered by a rich dataset from over 1,000 Parkinson's patients using the platform. The momentum extends to other conditions as well. As of 2025, the global market for epilepsy monitoring devices is projected to be valued at an impressive USD 582.3 million. Artificial Intelligence Is Driving a New Era of Diagnostic Precision Artificial intelligence (AI) is supercharging diagnostic capabilities within digital health in neurology market. Machine learning algorithms can analyze complex medical data with unprecedented speed and accuracy. For Parkinson's disease, a condition where early diagnosis is challenging, a new AI software called Automated Imaging Differentiation for Parkinsonism (AIDP) has demonstrated the ability to increase diagnostic precision to beyond 96%. This is a monumental leap compared to the current diagnostic accuracy of 55% to 78% within the first five years. A systematic review of 127 studies on AI-driven Parkinson's diagnosis found accuracy rates consistently ranging from 78% to 96%. An experimental multimodal AI diagnostic framework achieved a 94.2% accuracy in detecting early-stage disease. A deep-learning model analyzing medical and prescription data from 820 Parkinson's patients achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 0.937 when using data from three years preceding diagnosis. When analyzing an even earlier period (3-6 years before diagnosis), the model's accuracy improved to 0.922 with the inclusion of medication data. The trend extends to other conditions, with the US FDA clearing the NeuroQuant 5.0 software, an AI-powered tool for assessing MRI scans of patients being treated for Alzheimer's disease. These advancements are a cornerstone of the digital health in neurology market. Immersive Virtual Reality Therapies Are Redefining Neurorehabilitation Possibilities Virtual Reality (VR) is creating highly engaging and effective therapeutic environments for neurological recovery. The technology is proving particularly useful for patients recovering from stroke, brain injuries, and amputations. In a groundbreaking clinical trial for phantom limb pain, a VR treatment requiring leg movements led to a 39.6% pain reduction among seven participants with lower-limb amputations. Even a distractor VR treatment without leg movements in the same study resulted in a notable 28% decrease in pain. This early success has prompted an expansion of the proof-of-concept study, which initially involved eight subjects with below-knee amputations, to a larger sample size. These immersive solutions represent a high-growth segment within the broader digital health in neurology market, offering new hope for patients undergoing difficult rehabilitation journeys. Digital Biomarkers Are Accelerating the Pace of Neurological Clinical Research Digital biomarkers are revolutionizing how researchers track disease progression and treatment efficacy. Collected via sensors and mobile devices, these objective data points provide a high-frequency view of a patient's condition. Their impact on clinical trial efficiency is profound in the digital health in neurology market. A trial simulation for a hypothetical Parkinson's digital biomarker showed it could lead to a 55.7% reduction in the number of subjects needed for a one-year trial if it detected disease progression just 1.5 times faster than standard assessments. The same simulation indicated that a digital biomarker with a 0.5-fold reduced standard deviation could allow for a trial with 70.0% fewer subjects per arm. Companies are actively building a presence in this space. As of 2024, Rune Labs, a key player focused on digital biomarkers for Parkinson's, had already participated in 15 scientific conferences to share its findings. Robust Investment and a Dynamic Competitive Landscape Signal Strong Market Confidence The financial community is taking notice of the immense potential in neurotechnology. Venture capital and strategic investments are flowing into the digital health in neurology market, fueling innovation. In 2024, European tech companies raised over €1.1 billion in seed funding, with total funding for startups reaching $51 billion. Healthcare and biotechnology was the leading investment sector, attracting over $11 billion. The median pre-seed funding round in Europe grew by 15.7% in the second half of 2024 to €870,000. Specific deals highlight this trend. In October 2024, iGent AI secured a €7.6M seed round, Nomos raised a €1.9M pre-seed round, and In Parallel secured €2.78 million. The competitive landscape is equally dynamic. Blackrock Neurotech received a massive $200 million investment from Tether in 2024, valuing the company at approximately $350 million. Its NeuroPort Array system, priced at over half a million dollars, has been sold to several dozen hospitals. Blackrock Neurotech's estimated annual revenue is $60.7 million, with an estimated revenue per employee of $306,778. Before the latest investment, the company had already raised $50 million and had seen early revenue grow from approximately $700,000 to $3.5 million. Meanwhile, Rune Labs announced a strategic $12 million investment round in 2024, bringing its total funding to $42 million. Its StrivePD platform is also being used in a care management program with Kaiser Permanente.

Bitcoin ETFs saw $121.7 million in outflows on Monday and $523.3 million on Tuesday according to Farside Investors data, while Ethereum funds mirrored the weakness with $196.6 million and $422.2 million withdrawn on the same days. Fidelity's FBTC led the exodus with $246.9 million in redemptions, while Grayscale's GBTC shed $115.5 million and Bitwise's BITB lost $86.8 million across the two-day period. Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, told Decrypt that spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing outflows as investors "scale back risk ahead of the Jackson Hole meeting and Jerome Powell's speech on Friday." The latest withdrawals break momentum from mid-July through early August, when Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.7 billion in inflows at roughly $135 million a day. Otychenko attributed the selling to weak job growth combined with mixed inflation data that "left the Fed in a difficult spot, leaving the markets more uncertain about the path of future rate cuts." Net Taker Volume, which tracks whether buyers or sellers dominate exchange activity, plummeted to its “lowest point since December 2021,” indicating widespread selling pressure, he said. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's rallies since March have followed a weakening pattern, with "each breakout weaker, with smaller price moves and lighter trading volume." Dean Chen, analyst at Bitunix, shared similar sentiment, telling Decrypt the outflows stem from two main drivers: macro de-risking as "U.S. PPI came in hotter than expected" and issuer-level profit taking ahead of Powell's Jackson Hole speech. He noted that BlackRock's IBIT recorded zero flow, which "tells us this is more tactical de-risking than broad institutional exit." Konstantin Anissimov, global CEO of Currency.com, also remarked to Decrypt the outflows represent "a broad de-risking move rather than a problem with any single ETF." He pointed out that redemptions shifted from BlackRock and ARK on Monday to Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise the following day, showing "investors across the board are taking some chips off the table." Despite the substantial ETF outflows, Bitcoin's price is down just 1.5% on the day according to CoinGecko data, which Anissimov attributed to buyers using "$32 billion in stablecoin cash sitting on exchanges" to absorb the selling. He characterized institutional sentiment as "cautious right now, but not panicked," calling the movement "short-term profit-taking" rather than a fundamental shift. Markets now enter a critical waiting period as Powell's address approaches, with institutional flows likely to remain volatile until monetary policy clarity emerges.

Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, called this “a cautious price target” in an interview with CNBC at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. He pointed to supply-and-demand dynamics as the primary driver, saying “there’s just way more demand than the issued supply of Bitcoin, or the existing overall supply in the marketplace.” “I just think it’s a function of buying and only 450 Bitcoin being made by the network per day,” he told CNBC. In the interview, Scaramucci emphasized the “consolidation and institutional adoption” of Bitcoin over the past year, citing the launch of ETFs by firms such as BlackRock and the growing role of institutional investors. “If you went to a conference like this three years ago, it was mostly retail investors and CEOs working in the layer-one blockchain space,” he said. “Today, it’s lots more institutional investors.” Scaramucci predicted that much of this institutional investment “will likely go into the ETFs” as opposed to corporate Bitcoin investment vehicles like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a legacy tech firm which has built up one of the world's largest Bitcoin treasuries. Scaramucci has previously criticized companies that have adopted Strategy’s tactic of issuing debt to buy BTC for their corporate reserves. He argued that JPMorgan will choose to buy their Bitcoin via BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, saying “it's a very secure asset that people trust,” calling it the "purest link to Bitcoin.” This is currently the world's largest BTC fund as of writing. Scaramucci isn’t alone in issuing bullish end-of-year predictions. Earlier this week, institutional investor VanEck made a comparable prediction of Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by year-end. Scaramucci expressed a fairly bullish view about stablecoins, saying they will “bring a wave of technological innovation,” pointing to how they may allow users to avoid credit card fees and some of the other third-party fees which have historically been charged in the payments space. However, he was less optimistic about the prospects of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Scaramucci said he thinks CBDCs would be “too intrusive” from a privacy perspective, adding that he prefers dollar-based stablecoins. This is a view shared by his former boss, U.S. President Donald Trump.

New figures from the Central Statistics Office show that property prices registered monthly growth of 0.9% in June, the highest rate since November last year. Home prices across the country grew by 7.8% in the year to June, unchanged from the rate of growth the previous month, the CSO added. The CSO said the median price of a home purchased in June was €370,000. Today's figures show that property prices in Dublin - both houses and apartments - rose by 6.6% and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.8% compared with June last year. In the 12 months to June, the highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 8% while both Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin saw a rise of 5.5%. Outside of Dublin, house prices were up by 9% and apartment prices rose by 6.6%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the West (Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon) at 10.3%, while at the other end of the scale, the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) saw a 7.1% rise. The CSO noted that the highest median price paid for a home was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €190,000 in Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €780,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the least expensive price of €148,000. The CSO said that Dublin residential property prices are 5.9% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 21.8% higher than their May 2007 peak. Today's figures also show that a total of 4,029 home purchases were filed with Revenue, an increase of 13.1% increase compared with the 3,563 purchases in June last year and a 5.4% increase compared with the 3,824 purchases in May. Existing homes accounted for 76.7% of the transactions filed in June, an increase of 8.2% compared with June 2024. The balance of 23.3% were new homes, which marked a rise of 32.9% on the same time last year.

Commenting on today's CSO figures, Dermot O'Leary, the chief economist of Goodbody's, said that price inflation trends overall are heavily influenced by the second-hand market due to the share of total transactions. "Second-hand price inflation has exceeded new home price inflation for the past five quarters, with inflation in the new homes sector now modestly below wage inflation after a spike in 2022/2023 as construction costs surged," he said. Trevor Grant, Chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, said that the continued uptick in the rate of annual house price inflation will be a disappointment for would-be house buyers as it means houses are becoming more unaffordable for many of them. He said that ultimately, the biggest driver of Irish house price inflation is the shortage of homes coupled with the pent-up demand for housing and an expanding population. Mr Grant noted that the recent 35% increase in housing completions is encouraging, but housing completions are still nowhere near where they need to be. "The shortage of new homes available to private buyers means many first-time buyers are bidding against trader-uppers/movers, which in turn is driving up second-hand prices. It's becoming increasingly common for properties to sell for 20% above the asking price," he added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Could Rate Cuts Accelerate DeFi's $150 Billion Market?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/08/20/could-rate-cuts-accelerate-defis-150-billion-market/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T10:26:23Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The math is irresistible again. In 2020, Treasuries paid just 0.5% while DeFi yielded 8%. Speculators piled in, and institutions began testing with early pilots. But when rates broke above 5% in 2022, the flow reversed back to Treasuries. Now, with potential rate cuts on the horizon, the yield equation is shifting again. When the Fed cuts, traditional yields compress. DeFi rates, by contrast, are set by supply and demand rather than central bank policy, making them largely insulated. As Treasuries fall, the relative gap between market-driven DeFi yields and risk-free rates widens, making DeFi attractive again. The rate environment is shifting. Markets assign 83% probability to Fed cuts beginning September 2025, while Goldman Sachs forecasts three quarter-point reductions by year-end. As traditional yields potentially compress toward 3–3.25%, DeFi's market-driven yields could once again offer compelling spreads. The question isn't whether this recreates 2020's conditions—it's whether institutions will respond more decisively this time, given the infrastructure improvements and regulatory clarity that have emerged since then. During 2022’s crypto winter, digital assets collapsed by over 90%, wiping out billions. Yet most DeFi protocols survived and kept functioning. The resilience was tested again in 2023: Silicon Valley Bank, the backbone of the tech ecosystem with $175 billion in deposits, collapsed in just 48 hours, trapping $3.3 billion of Circle’s USDC reserves and briefly depegging the stablecoin. Yet while banks froze, DeFi kept running, and USDC quickly regained its peg once the FDIC guaranteed deposits. Today, this ecosystem holds just under $150 billion in TVL (total value locked). The infrastructure has endured exchange implosions and regulatory crackdowns. DeFi’s resilience is drawing fresh institutional interest, with Wall Street now paying closer attention. JPMorgan and Oliver Wyman call this “Institutional DeFi”—a model that merges protocol innovation with traditional safeguards and could drive significant growth. At its core, DeFi replicates traditional financial services without banks or intermediaries. It rests on five major pillars: staking, lending, payments, tokenization, and yield farming. Together, these pillars form the architecture of decentralized markets and explain where activity and returns are concentrated. Locking or staking tokens on a blockchain secures the network and earns steady returns. It is the crypto equivalent of a CD (Certificate of Deposit), with instant settlement and non-custodial control. Rewards, drawn from transaction fees and newly issued tokens, flow to validators, the independent computers that secure the network, who then share payouts with stakers. In practice, it feels like interest income, but the source is the network itself rather than a bank. Ethereum staking currently pays 3–4% through mainstream providers, while Solana offers 5–8%. Beyond staking, stablecoin lending ranges from 4% to 9% depending on the platform. These yields are set by supply and demand in decentralized markets, not by central bank policy. Bitcoin's proof-of-work design limits native yield options, leaving most strategies focused on Ethereum and alternative chains. The staking landscape is crowded, with exchanges, enterprise players, and specialized providers competing for mandates. Coinbase and Kraken exemplify the exchange-led model, managing tens of billions and continuing to dominate retail flows. Pure-play providers like Figment (34% share) and Kiln (27%) compete on size and enterprise ties, layering in compliance, reporting, and onboarding to command large institutional mandates. Similar strategies are visible across Blockdaemon, which serves enterprise and developer ecosystems, and Stakefish, which caters to a global validator and delegator base. Among them, Chorus One makes staking simple and secure across 40+ networks with no custodial risk and minimal technical setup. Institutional-grade and ISO-certified, it supports Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and other major blockchains. The company optimizes returns through strategies developed by its quantitative research team, while users gain competitive rewards on their assets. This fragmented landscape highlights both opportunity and risk, as institutions weigh proven execution against marketing promises. If staking is the baseline, lending is the next layer, turning idle assets into active credit markets. In DeFi, lending and borrowing feel familiar, but the middleman is gone. Investors supply Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana through protocols like Aave and Compound. Borrowers post collateral directly on-chain, and smart contracts handle the rest. Rates rise when demand surges and fall when it cools. The most mature lending market revolves around dollar-pegged tokens. By lending USDC, USDT, or DAI, investors earn 4–9% yields, driven by constant demand for dollar liquidity. Returns come from borrowers paying interest, not the blockchain. In practice, it works like a global money market: programmable, transparent, and outside the banking system. If lending unlocks credit, stablecoins move the money itself. Stablecoins are no longer limited to lending; they are reshaping payments. Stripe and PayPal now extend crypto features to hundreds of millions of users, while Visa pilots USDC settlement and JPMorgan clears blockchain-based transactions through its Onyx network. These developments signal stablecoins’ entry into the financial mainstream. Behind the scenes, they already power the rails: USDT and USDC settle trillions of dollars on-chain each year, fueled by trading, remittances, and cross-border flows. Their biggest impact is emerging in cross-border payments, long plagued by high fees, delays, and limited access. Crypto-native companies are pushing into territory where traditional payments simply can't reach: peer-to-peer transactions. Kraken has launched Krak for crypto and fiat transfers across more than 100 countries. Another example, Paymento is rethinking crypto payments with a non-custodial gateway, where transactions settle wallet-to-wallet without third-party custody. It supports stablecoins across Bitcoin, Solana, EVM chains, and Tron. Freelancers can create payment links while merchants access plug-and-play integration with real-time settlement. Together, these efforts are shifting payments from bank-dependent rails to always-on, programmable networks. Execution is uneven, but adoption is accelerating. Illiquid assets are gaining liquidity. Real estate, commodities, and even invoices can be tokenized, and once digitized, they can trade around the clock on global networks while generating yield from their cash flows. The result is new liquidity from previously idle holdings. The market is scaling quickly. On-chain RWA (real-world asset) value surpassed $24 billion by mid-2025, nearly five times higher than three years ago. BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, now holds more than $12 billion across six blockchains. Polygon, Franklin Templeton, JPMorgan, and Avalanche with KKR are piloting tokenized Treasuries and funds. At the application layer, collaborative programs are emerging to support tokenized ventures. Haven1, a security-focused layer-1 for DeFi and real-world assets, and yard[hub]’s web3 Growth Camp accelerator have launched a joint program that combines Haven1’s next-generation infrastructure, technical support, and grants with yard[hub]’s venture-building expertise to provide a secure, compliance-aware environment for emerging DeFi and RWA projects from the outset. Despite this momentum, the gap between ambition and proven institutional adoption remains wide, and ultimate success will depend on execution rather than marketing. Yield farming means placing crypto into DeFi platforms as liquidity so others can trade, borrow, or lend. In return, investors earn a mix of trading fees and bonus tokens. It works like renting out your assets: rewards can be high, but they are risky since they depend on market activity and incentives that can shift quickly. Funds are usually flexible, though some platforms offer extra rewards for longer commitments. But whether staking, lending, or farming, none of it matters without secure storage and institutional-grade safeguards. On the consumer side, wallets have progressed from Trezor’s open-source devices for early adopters to Ledger’s millions of hardware units and MetaMask’s 100 million browser users. Each lowered barriers but stopped short of mass adoption. Tangem, a newer player in the crypto wallet industry, offers credit card-shaped devices and aims to onboard the next billion users by eliminating reliance on seed phrases. However, even with complexity out of the way, form factor alone cannot overcome user inertia and the broader challenges of education and trust that have long held back widespread adoption. At the institutional end, custody has matured into a layered system. Fireblocks, BitGo, and Coinbase Prime add safeguards like multi-signature security, compliance reporting, and insurance—bringing DeFi yields closer to fiduciary standards. They make staking, lending, and asset management viable at a scale regulators can live with. Regulation is catching up. Compliant, audited protocols are winning institutional approval, while experimental platforms face uncertainty. Europe’s MiCA rules and US stablecoin guidance raise costs but provide clarity. For institutions, the trade-off is simple: pay more for compliance and buy legitimacy, trust, and access to the market. These services effectively make digital asset management align with the expectations of traditional fiduciary oversight. The first wave of DeFi delivered both innovation and chaos. Many platforms kept customer funds in custody, allowing operators to rehypothecate—re-lend or make leveraged bets with user assets. When those bets went bad, the results were catastrophic. Terra Luna, Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager each collapsed almost overnight, erasing billions and shaking investor trust. The key distinction lies between truly decentralized protocols like Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and MakerDAO, which continued operating throughout the crisis, and centralized platforms that collapsed. Users keep control of their assets, with transactions executed automatically by code. User experience has leapt forward, too. What began with clunky browser extensions and jargon is now mobile-first, with fiat on-ramps, clean interfaces, and recovery via MPC or smart-contract wallets. The ecosystem has been stress-tested through brutal drawdowns and long crypto winters. Managing risk is central to any portfolio, and DeFi is no different. Investors must weigh not only macro and industry factors, but also risks unique to decentralized markets. Technical risk: DeFi hacks still cost millions every month, but platforms that undergo audits and offer bug bounties get hacked much less often. Market risk: Terra's 2022 implosion erased $60 billion in days and even shook Tether's peg—without circuit breakers, cascades spread instantly. Operational risk: Malicious insiders still pose threats—$95 million disappeared across 17 insider attacks in 2024. The crucial difference: non-custodial protocols eliminate the rehypothecation risk that destroyed Celsius and BlockFi. Users maintain control of their assets, with transactions executed automatically by code rather than human discretion. Regulatory uncertainty: Europe's MiCA framework went live in January 2025, requiring crypto service providers to obtain licenses or face an 18-month transition deadline. But Europe isn't done; targeted DeFi regulation is coming by 2026, though regulators still haven't defined what "decentralization" actually means. Meanwhile, US regulatory clarity remains fragmented despite new pro-crypto leadership, creating a compliance maze for institutions operating globally. Remember: if you can't identify the source of exceptional returns, you probably haven't identified the risk. Unlike traditional banking institutions, DeFi protocols can't call the Federal Reserve for emergency liquidity. When markets freeze and there's no backstop, cascades can turn into floods instantly, triggering catastrophic collapse. As Fed cuts squeeze traditional yields, DeFi’s yields could offer a 200–400 basis point premium over Treasuries. Institutional DeFi could represent a structural source of alpha, albeit with higher risk, built on infrastructure that has survived stress tests and reinforced by regulatory frameworks now crystallizing. For institutional portfolios, this creates three actionable opportunities: infrastructure exposure through vetted staking and custody providers; yield enhancement via compliant protocols offering market-driven returns; and early positioning in the payment rails that will underpin tomorrow’s financial system. ‘We’ve been emphasizing for years the need for the large institutional market, where most of the world’s value currently resides, to flow into the blockchain industry. We’re now helping facilitate this shift in a reliable, technical, and secure way,’ said Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink. With nearly $150 billion already locked, the rails are in place. The question is not if institutions will step in, but how quickly they will build the conviction to do so. Disclosure: The companies mentioned represent examples of different strategic approaches within each infrastructure category. Inclusion does not constitute endorsement, and institutional adoption timelines across all providers remain uncertain.

Not enough homes are being built to satisfy demand. Property prices rose again in June, with the cost of homes going up every month now for close to two years. Prices were up by 7.8pc in the year to June, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) said. This the same rate of property-price inflation that was recorded in May. New CSO figures come on the back of a recent report from Daft.ie, which found that Irish house price inflation has reached a 10-year-high. In the year to June, the typical, or median, price of a home was €370,000, the same figure that was recorded in the previous month. The cost of a typical home is now up by €35,000 since June last year. The June figures for the property price index from the CSO represent the 22nd month in a row in that prices have risen, putting huge squeeze on first-time buyers and movers. Second-hand home prices are increasing by more than double those of new homes. A chronic shortage of new homes to buy means many first-time buyers are bidding against trader-uppers and movers. This is driving up second-hand prices. In the three-month period up to June, new home prices were 4.2pc higher than in the same quarter last year, the CSO said. Prices of second-hand homes in the second quarter of this year were 8.8pc higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.6pc in June, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.8pc compared with June last year The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to June was €370,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June 2025 was A94, which takes in Blackrock, Co Dublin. It had a median price of €780,000. The F45 Eircode, which takes in Castlerea, in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In June 2025, 4,029 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.7bn. These purchases were made up of 3,092 existing dwellings and 937 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June. The regions outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices were the West, consisting of Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon, at 10.3pc The Midlands saw price growth of 10.2pc. At the other end of the scale, the South-East area that takes in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford, saw a 7.1pc rise in house prices. Senior underwriter at Núa Money Donal Magee said: “House price inflation continues to pick up in Ireland, which has increased by 7.8pc in past 12 months to June 2025.” He said this means many people will continue struggle to buy a home. Recently, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) told an Oireachtas committee there will be no major uptick in housing supply this year or in 2026. It said Government targets set to be missed in both years. ESRI economists said a tight construction labour force and low productivity levels mean the outlook for housing remains bleak. ESRI research professor with the ESRI Conor O’Toole said these factors, coupled with the out-turn for 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, mean the group does “not foresee any major uptick in 2025 and 2026 in housing supply”. He said the ESRI is currently forecasting 33,000 units in 2025 and 37,000 units in 2026, which would be well below Government targets of 41,000 this year and 43,000 next year. Furthermore, Mr O’Toole added most of the risks “weigh on the downside”. The slow delivery of new homes comes at a time when demand for housing continues to surge. Close to one in five consumers in this country are looking to rent or buy, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland said, quoting European Central Bank statistics. Demand for housing in this country is now the second highest in Europe, after the Netherlands. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: In Ukraine, the ‘Buts’ Win in the End

I love you, BUT I’m not “in love” with you. You don’t have to go home, BUT you can’t stay here. You may continue fighting, Martial Law President Zelensky, BUT the American people won’t be following you into World War III. No matter how agreeable the first half of a sentence might sound, the “buts” change everything on a dime. President Trump has been clear that he wants the Russia-Ukraine War to end, but he says Zelensky must choose to end the conflict. When the war began, 73% of Ukrainians wanted to fight Russia until Ukraine secured victory, but 69% now want the war to end as soon as possible through negotiations! Perhaps that is why Z-Man agreed to meet President Trump in D.C. It was widely rumored that U.S. officials encouraged the battledress-wearing comedian to don a real suit for the occasion, but the holdover-president wore a military-style jacket in all black. The guy who plays piano with his penis still looks out of his element at the White House, but he does dress like someone attending his own funeral. With the titular head of the Ukrainian government back at the White House — surrounded by an entourage of European honchos eager to butt in — we will finally discover whether some kind of peace between Russia and Ukraine is tenable. To be sure, there are many powerful people in the United States and across Europe who would prefer to keep Ukraine a battlefield for years to come. Why? As a man holding onto the presidency eighteen months beyond his elected term, Zelensky might finally bring peace to his war-torn country, but he will likely be voted out of office once the exigencies of martial law disappear. U.K. prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen may publicly express their desire for lasting European peace, but the Russian bogeyman has long been the perfect scapegoat and distraction for European societies self-immolating from mass immigration, censorship, and “climate change” communism. The World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and other august organizations ostensibly dedicated to global welfare might applaud an end to bloodshed, but all of their depopulation enthusiasts will no doubt regret the loss of a conflict zone chalking up more deaths than births. BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other international investment houses will be happy to make money from lucrative rebuilding projects in Ukraine, but they will lament that the war did not topple President Putin and open up Russian lands to their profit-seeking conquest. Weapons manufacturers will be glad to have so much demand from American and European militaries desperate to restock munitions after years of supplying Ukraine, but their boards of directors will be busy finding new places around the globe to slaughter in the cutthroat business of war. So there may well be happy faces and cheers over the next few days and weeks when it comes to the prospect of Ukrainian peace, but there will be plenty of villains scowling behind the scenes — all hoping that the tentative peace breaks and the carnage resumes. Those European and Chinese power-players who have long seen war between the Russian Federation and the United States as an opportunity to diminish both countries simultaneously will say all the right things in upbeat social media postings praising compromise, but they will regret that the America-last Biden administration is no longer around to stumble recklessly into nuclear war. Spy agencies across the West may pause their “color revolution” activities long enough to install a new Ukrainian puppet into the presidency, but they will continue their hybrid warfare operations in former Warsaw Pact countries. London and New York City bankers will perhaps allow Russian citizens to access their overseas assets once again, but Western central banks will pursue monetary policies that cause enough domestic turmoil in target countries to return the West to a state of war in the near future. In sound bites, everyone loves peace, but in the world of big business, war means profits. War is big business, but it is also a convenient political distraction. During the destructive interregnum of the Biden installation, Democrats laundered trillions of dollars in “Green New Deal” spending through the Build Back Better Act (cynically relabeled the Inflation Reduction Act to appeal to idiotic members of the press). While that legislation stole from taxpayers and accomplished nothing for the American people, it put enormous sums of money into the bank accounts of Democrat-run NGOs structured as “social justice” and “environmental justice” front groups. Combined with Democrats’ ongoing war against inexpensive hydrocarbon energies, the inflation-triggering money-printing of that harmful legislative handout to Establishment insiders and crony capitalists doubled grocery prices in the United States. How did Democrats explain away their disastrous handling of the economy to struggling American families? They simply blamed Russia (as they have for the last decade) and called the spike in the cost of living “Putin’s price hike.” Sure, the cost of food, fuel, and basic necessities rose precipitously during the bungling Biden administration, but Russia, Russia, Russia! Americans were even encouraged to view their growing household bills as a patriotic form of suffering worth enduring in America’s undeclared alliance with Ukraine against the Russian Federation. First, Democrats blamed Hillary’s 2016 election loss on imaginary Russian bots and contrived Russian collusion. Then they blamed the massive spike in prices on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Europe has played the same cynical game against its citizens. Instead of admitting that “green energy” totalitarianism is destroying the continent’s industrial competitiveness and household wealth, mendacious politicians blame the War in Ukraine for their crumbling economies. Of course, the rise in energy costs across Europe might also have something to do with ineffective sanctions against Russian energy companies (that merely divert Russian products to China and the greater Global South); the convenient sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines; and Ukraine’s military attacks on key pipelines transporting oil and natural gas from Russia to households in Hungary, Slovakia, and other parts of Europe. The more expensive ordinary goods become, the louder Eurocrats insist that the problem is not “green energy”–induced inflation but rather Russia’s war in Ukraine! For European politicians, the Russia-Ukraine War supplies many ancillary benefits. It provides already indebted nations an excuse to borrow more money for defense spending. It creates a common enemy for the European Commission to exploit as a life-and-death reason for member states to relinquish national sovereignty. It creates a distraction from the rising frequency of social conflicts related to rampant illegal immigration. It provides a pretext for canceling inconvenient election results in Romania and designating popular political parties as national security threats. It allows the prevailing Establishment to entrench its control over the European bureaucracy. As Democrats in America and socialists in Europe are fond of whispering, Never let a crisis go to waste. Turning Russia into an irredeemable bugaboo and Ukraine into some saintly bastion of “democracy” worthy of every European’s sacrifice is how we have gotten to the point when all of Europe’s problems are brushed aside. Serious people may be warning about a looming civil war in the United Kingdom, but Ukraine’s territorial integrity is all that matters. Churches in France may be burning down for unexplained reasons, but Russians are the real threat. The German economy may be fundamentally unsound, but military spending will create jobs. Americans and Europeans should want the killing in Ukraine to end, but there are just so many politicians and bankers who find that outcome disappointing. In all likelihood, this war would have continued for many more years. But, thankfully, the American people elected President Trump. Hat tip to Megan Draper, M.S. Image via Raw Pixel.

Title: Volkswagen Is Turning Engine Performance into a Subscription Upgrade

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/19/2025 9:39:59 AM PDT by packagingguy Volkswagen is now offering owners of its ID.3 EV hatchback the option to boost their car’s performance — for a monthly subscription fee. Instead of following the traditional model of offering improved performance through upgraded components, VW has locked its car’s true potential behind a software subscription. Auto Express reports that German automaker Volkswagen has introduced a subscription-based model for unlocking the full potential of its ID.3 electric car, a new model available in the UK. While the ID.3 Pro and Pro S models are listed on the configurator as producing 201 horsepower, buyers must pay a monthly subscription fee of £16.50 ($22.29) to access the car’s maximum output of 228 horsepower. This subscription, which comes after a one-month free trial, is nearly three times the cost of a standard Netflix subscription with ads. Owners can also opt for a lifetime subscription priced at £649 ($877), which remains tied to the vehicle even if it is sold. Volkswagen states that the performance upgrade increases the net power by 27 horsepower and the maximum torque from 265Nm to 310Nm without affecting the car’s range. As the ID.3 is registered at 228 horsepower from the factory, owners are not required to inform their insurance company about the upgrade. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

Serfs were not property, but they were tied to the land, which was owned by a lord. The serf had to work the land for the lord because there was no other option. Slaves were property. They did the work they were told to do, they could be sold to distant places, families could be broken up. Free people work where they want to, earn their own money, and can purchase “stuff” which is their own property. Now you can’t really own much of anything. I’m not sure I see the benefit of working and striving. Technofeudalism.

Title: 10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Aug. 19, 2025)

Full Content:
What to make of Vanguard’s moves to diversify from its core business of passive funds. How the hidden costs in leveraged ETFs eat into returns. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 19, 2025 Think of the Stock Market as Great Businesses—Not a ‘Hissing, Writhing Bag of Poisonous Snakes’ “And that’s the mother of all sort of hardwired human nature kinks that causes people to fail as investors. And what I’ve said to advisors is 85% to 90% of your job is that, is the management of that. You make a plan. You set goals once. Assuming the goals haven’t changed and don’t change, you make a plan once.” (Morningstar) Vanguard’s Push Into Active Is Anything But Passive “Aside from the active strategies, an obvious common denominator is the name Wellington. That would be investment firm Wellington Management, which was founded in 1928 and, in 1951, hired John C. Bogle, who would then go on to establish the Vanguard Group in 1975. Needless to say, Vanguard and Wellington have a history together, and the former is tapping into the deep well of asset management expertise in the latter to create these new ETFs.” (VettaFi) Leveraged ETFs: The Hidden Costs That Eat Your Returns “To most market watchers, the default explanation for long-term underperformance in leveraged ETFs is volatility decay, or the math that comes from these funds resetting leverage daily to match their target multiple (like 2x). In choppy markets, that reset can create a ‘buy high, sell low’ effect that steadily erodes returns compared with a simple multiple of the underlying’s long-term performance.” (ETF.com) BlackRock's Rick Rieder: This is the best investing environment ever “Rick Rieder, BlackRock global fixed income CIO, joins 'Closing Bell' to discuss Rieder's thoughts on the current investing environment, if the Fed will cut rates in September and risks to equity markets.” (CNBC) When ‘invest like the 1%’ fails: How Yieldstreet’s real estate bets left customers with massive losses “But Yieldstreet customers who participated in its real estate deals in recent years say they’ve learned the flip side of the private markets: They face huge losses on investments that turned out far riskier than they thought, while their money has been locked up for years with little to show for it besides frustration.”(CNBC) Alts Managers Face Skepticism from RIAs Over Private Credit ETFs “But vehicle familiarity among RIAs remains low, and asset managers looking to be early movers are having to invest in educational and marketing outreach.” (FundFire) How One Big Private-Equity Fund Makes Its Numbers Incomprehensible “Such funds should, at a minimum, allow investors to see how much each private-equity holding originally cost and compare that with its latest carrying value. Some funds are making this exercise difficult. This is particularly problematic in light of recent controversies over some of the industry’s valuation methods.” (WSJ) How Semiliquid Funds Became the Preferred Vehicle for Private Assets “Traditional and alternative asset managers have seized on interval funds in particular, which have familiar tickers, electronic trading, tax forms, and regulatory disclosures, as the preferred vehicle to offer private assets to regular advisors and investors.” (Morningstar) Amidst Tragedy, Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust ‘Continues to Stand Strong’ “The firm recapped its year-to-date and overall performance – the first time since the passing Wesley LePatner in a mass shooting at the firm’s Manhattan headquarters. The board of directors has since appointed Rob Harper, a seasoned Blackstone executive, as interim CEO. The company also said it is drawing upon Frank Cohen’s extensive leadership experience as board chair and former CEO of BREIT during this period.” (AltsWire) AGM Alts Weekly | 8.17.25: Own the narrative “There were major moves that signal an important evolution in how investment firms and companies are looking to own the direct relationship with their community and customers. Companies recognize that in today’s world they need to go direct. They need to be their own media.” (Alt Goes Mainstream) Related:Social Media, Video Gaming ETFs Outperform YTD Due to Global Growth Prospects You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Aug 20, 2025 Aug 20, 2025 Content Spotlight Navigate today's complex financial landscape with our comprehensive 2025 Midyear Outlook.

Father-son duo Randy and Matt Price and colleague Matthew Kerns launch Houston-based Clear Trail Advisors after an 18-month review. August 19, 2025 A father-son duo has left registered investment advisor Steward Partners to launch their own shop on the Dynasty Financial Partners platform. Chairman Randy Price and son and CEO Matt Price have started Houston-based Clear Trail Advisors, which has $850 million in assets and a self-proclaimed focus on “the millionaire next door” or those in need of portfolios that can generate retirement income and leverage tax strategies. The Prices are leaving their Steward practice, which was called The Price Group, along with Clear Trail co-founder Matthew Kerns and four other staff members, two of whom were recently hired, according to Randy Price. “This has been an 18-month process,” Randy Price said. “We wanted to own our future, we wanted to own the client experience, and we wanted to own the ability to take care of the client because at the end of the day, that is what makes the world go round.” Randy Price was an executive managing director at Steward, an employee-owned hybrid partnership of independent advisory firms, for over seven years. Before that, he had an over 18-year run as a financial advisor at RBC Wealth Management. But he goes back to earlier in his career, when he was doing financial planning for executives at companies such as ConocoPhillips, General Motors, and Shell, as shaping the planning-first mentality of Clear Trail. Related:Mariner to Acquire $5B Institutional Consulting Firm “Everybody today in our team that is client-facing has to have their CFP,” Randy Price said. “We don’t do investments before we do comprehensive planning.” Randy Price said he had considered moving to Dynasty years ago, but it wasn’t yet the right fit. Now, he said the team is ready to work within their model and focus areas, which include every client having a “family index number” that guides their financial plan. They will leverage Dynasty for back-office support such as planning tools, compliance, accounting and investment platforms. Randy Price also liked the peer group he would join at Dynasty, which has over 55 network firms and more than 500 Dynasty network advisors. “When you look at the people who have joined them, it’s a who’s who of Phi Beta Kappa in the industry,” he said. “To be in that group is a distinct honor.” In 2022, Dynasty sold minority stakes to Charles Schwab and private equity firm Abry Partners. In 2024, it announced a minority capital raise from BlackRock, JP Morgan Asset Management and Schwab. Clear Trail is looking to hire a director of financial planning and an in-house tax specialist. Randy Price said it also plans to hire more advisors interested in its model. Related:Merchant Invests In $4.2B Meridian Wealth with Aim to Fuel Growth “There are a lot of like-minded advisors out there that own their own practice and don’t want to go sell their business and give their clients away, if you will, to somebody they don’t really know, and they want a nice landing point for their career as well,” he said. “We’re building our new office with that in mind.” Randy Price said he sees himself working for at least seven to 10 more years, but expects his son and Kerns to continue what he expects to be a larger RIA by the time he retires. “As I look back, I feel like I’ve been somewhat of a franchisee over a number of years,” Randy Price said. “More and more people are leaving the wirehouses. ... the votes are that this is a much better space, a much better arena, a much better opportunity to do what we were called to do without the overhang of corporate influences.” Alex Ortolani Senior Reporter, WealthManagement.com Alex Ortolani is a New York-based senior reporter with WealthManagement.com with a focus on deals, moves and trends in the registered investment advisor space.

Title: Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks ahead of a storm, and could buy them back after it hits, top strategist says

Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks because he sees a storm on the horizon — and could buy them back once prices tumble, a senior market strategist says. The "Oracle of Omaha" has a "history of selling out of the stock market" when economic and financial indicators are "signaling a bear market or a recession is coming," Wedbush's chief investment strategist, Paul Dietrich, told Business Insider. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks for 11 straight quarters, even though the market has "soared" to new highs in that period, Dietrich added. The investor's conglomerate offloaded $212 billion of shares while only buying $34.5 billion, meaning its net disposals exceeded $177 billion — more than the market value of BlackRock or Boeing. Buffett also halted stock buybacks for the last four quarters as he no longer saw Berkshire stock as cheap, Dietrich said. The pause marks a big change from Berkshire's peak repurchases of over $20 billion in both 2020 and 2021. Berkshire's share sales and lack of buybacks have contributed to its cash pile, which more than tripled to a record $344 billion over the three years to June 30. Buffett has jettisoned stocks and gone to cash ahead of past downturns, Dietrich said. Berkshire grew its cash pile from around $11 billion in 1997 to $35 billion in 1998, and ramped up its net stock sales from $700 million in 1999 to $2.7 billion in 2000, ahead of the dot-com crash. The corporate titan had grown its cash pile to more than $70 billion when the financial crisis struck. It fell to about $52 billion by the end of 2008 as Buffett made a series of lucrative deals during the disaster. Berkshire ramped up its net stock purchases from around $5 billion in 2006 to $11 billion in 2007 as it capitalized on depressed asset prices. Buffett sounded cautious about the market during Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Dietrich said. Before his shock announcement that he intended to step down as CEO at the end of this year, Buffett bemoaned the lack of potential bargains as asset valuations continued to rise. Dietrich said the "Buffett Indicator" may be alarming the Berkshire CEO. The gauge, which compares the US stock market's value to the US economy's size, has surged to historic highs of above 210%, he said. That means the combined market capitalization of all actively traded US stocks is more than double the latest quarterly estimate of US GDP. Buffett once wrote that buying stocks at readings approaching 200% would be "playing with fire." The Wall Street veteran recalled Buffett's famous advice to "be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful," saying the Berkshire chief is preparing to pounce once valuations fall to attractive levels. Dietrich said Buffett would use his cash pile "to eventually buy back Apple and the other shares he has sold — but at a major discount —after the current nose-bleed stock market highs eventually come back down to earth."

Highlights Neurosymbolic AI blends neural networks with logic-based reasoning to reduce hallucinations and improve trust in generative AI. Amazon and Imandra are advancing the approach in parallel, Amazon with warehouse robots and shopping assistants, Imandra with finance, code verification and regulatory compliance. Imandra’s tools, such as Code Logician, promise to slash error-prone processes with “mathematical guarantees,” according to the startup. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can astound with human-like conversation and research superpowers, but it can also be disastrously wrong. That unreliability is a major barrier to adoption as AI begins to control physical machines, payments and other high-stakes domains.

Δ Neurosymbolic AI is a rising technique that aims to solve the hallucination problem. It’s a hybrid approach that marries gen AI’s neural networks for pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning’s logic that can prove whether outputs are correct, with mathematical precision. The goal is to maintain the flexibility of generative AI while making its outputs trustworthy. Trust is a key factor for greater adoption of generative and agentic AI, according to a July 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report. While chief financial officers (CFOs) have warmed up to generative AI, they are still unsure whether they could trust agentic AI. Just 15% of executives are considering deployment. Neurosymbolic AI could help. Its roots stem from the early 20th century, when mathematicians developed ways to formalize reasoning using symbolic logic, laying the foundation of modern computing. Out of that tradition grew automated reasoning, a subset of symbolic reasoning that uses logic to prove the correctness of computer programs. Amazon has become one of neurosymbolic AI’s most prominent adopters, according to The Wall Street Journal. Its Automated Reasoning Group, founded more than a decade ago, built tools to verify security policies in the AWS cloud. Those methods now underpin new systems such as the Vulcan warehouse robots, which combine neural networks for perception with automated reasoning for precise planning. Amazon also applies neurosymbolic AI to customer-facing products. The Rufus shopping assistant, for example, uses large language models for conversation but leans on automated reasoning to ensure recommendations align with rules and policies. In August, Amazon announced an automated reasoning feature to minimize hallucinations, claiming it can identify correct model responses with up to 99% accuracy. “This is emblematic of where the field is going,” Imandra Co-founder and co-CEO Grant Passmore said in an interview with PYMNTS. “Fundamentally, just large language models on their own cannot be trusted to reliably reason. On the other hand, you have this incredible and hitherto underutilized field of AI — which is automated reasoning — completely built on logic, completely precise” and independently audited. See also: The Two Faces of AI: Gen AI’s Triumph Meets Agentic AI’s Caution Amazon’s automated reasoning group was founded by Byron Cook, its former distinguished scientist. About 20 years ago, he and Passmore crossed paths at Cambridge University in the U.K. In 2014, Passmore and Co-founder and Co-CEO Denis Ignatovich — a college friend who ran Deutsche Bank’s equities trading desk in London — founded Imandra to apply neurosymbolic logic to finance. Ignatovich’s constant concern was that a developer working on the trading system could inadvertently omit a line of code that causes the system to violate a regulation — and it becoming a big issue. At the time, Passmore was working on new techniques for reasoning in the U.K. “We realized we could actually commercialize this stuff,” Passmore said. “Finance needs it. Financial regulators need it, and finance can pay for it.” Founded in 2014 and incorporated in the U.S. in 2019, Imandra has raised $23 million from investors including Citi, Green Visor Capital, Albion, IQ Capital and Austin’s LiveOak Venture Partners. Goldman Sachs is a client, and Citi led its most recent round. One use case is automating the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol, which lets organizations send electronic trading instructions to each other, say from Goldman Sachs to BlackRock or the New York Stock Exchange. “Every computer in capital markets trading uses a version of this protocol, but everybody is allowed to customize it,” Passmore said. Typically, these quirks are described in 100-page PDFs. To connect, companies had to interpret the manual, build their own client code and then test repeatedly to make sure both sides can connect without errors. Imandra built a mathematically precise language for specifying the FIX protocol. Instead of relying on hundreds of pages of PDFs, clients can now use automated reasoning to ensure precise communication each way. “This very error-prone process at the plumbing level of the markets used to take sometimes upwards of six months” for a new participant to be onboarded, Passmore said. “Now they can be onboarded within three days with mathematical guarantees.” To scale its approach, Imandra launched Imandra Universe, a platform it describes as the first marketplace for neurosymbolic agents. Similar to Hugging Face’s repository for machine learning models, it hosts symbolic reasoning engines specialized in domains from geometry to logistics. A “Reasoner Gateway” lets developers plug them into agent frameworks, augmenting AI systems with logical checks. One flagship tool, Code Logician, targets the flood of AI-generated code. Once installed in coding assistants like Cursor, Code Logician builds a mathematical description of what the AI generated code is doing and use Imandra to verify it. Passmore said around 60% of AI-generated code contains bugs and Code Logician can make 96% of the code correct within three iterations. Imandra is expanding Code Logician beyond Python to Java and even COBOL, reflecting enterprise demand for code migration. It is also developing agents for geometry reasoning, among other pursuits.

Title: Exclusive: Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital to tokenize $300 million on Avalanche
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/19/anthony-scaramucci-skybridge-capital-tokenization-avalanche/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T14:00:00Z

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another investment firm is putting funds on the blockchain. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, announced Tuesday that his company plans to hold around $300 million from two funds in the form of tokenized assets. SkyBridge’s move comes amid a wave of enthusiasm for what the crypto industry calls tokenization. The process entails creating digital token versions of real-world assets like Treasury bills, which can be easily traded on a blockchain in the same way as Bitcoin or stablecoins. “I’m basically seeing 2026 into 2027 as the age of real-world tokenization,” Scaramucci, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had a brief stint at the White House during President Donald Trump’s first term, told Fortune. SkyBridge Capital plans to deploy its tokenized funds on Avalanche, a blockchain that boasts almost $2 billion in assets on its network, according to crypto analytics provider DefiLlama. The amount of money that SkyBridge will deploy is about 10% of his firm’s assets under management, Scaramucci told Fortune. One of the two funds he’s tokenizing specializes in investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have not been deemed securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to SkyBridge’s most recent investor disclosure. The other is a fund of funds composed of SkyBridge’s other investment vehicles, including both its venture and crypto funds. Advocates say issuing products like investment funds on decentralized networks can reduce transaction fees and cut out middlemen. Traditionally, there are a series of individuals between the buyers and sellers of financial assets, each of whom has to vet and evaluate the origin of, say, a stake in a fund—even if that fund is made up of cryptocurrencies already on blockchains. Each of these middlemen can charge fees and slow the process down. Blockchains are decentralized databases, meaning that no one party can tamper with the information stored on the network. Hence, there theoretically does not need to be a middleman to verify the owner and authenticity of a financial asset issued on it. Users can look up the details themselves. While proponents have lauded the virtues of tokenization for some time, the business of putting real-world assets on blockchains is still nascent, though it appears to be gaining momentum. Financial heavyweights like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck have recently issued their own money-market funds onto a series of blockchains like Solana and Aptos. Eventually, advocates envision a world where investors can buy and transfer their stakes in various funds without having to wade through spreadsheets or repeated calls to banks to wire money. SkyBridge Capital plans to partner with Tokeny, a company that specializes in tokenization, to put its funds on Avalanche. “Ultimately, we want to achieve two things,” said John Wu, the president of Ava Labs, one of the main developers behind the Avalanche network. “One is to bring activity on chain from the traditional finance world and also show the world that this technology can benefit them in terms of cost savings.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Softbank offers lifeline to Intel with $2B investment
URL: https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/softbank-intel-reach-2-billion-investment-deal-semiconductor-innovation/758041/
Time Published: 2025-08-19T13:18:00Z

Let Manufacturing Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The deal coincides with unconfirmed reports that the Trump administration is considering a minority government stake in the semiconductor company. Japan-based Softbank Group will make a $2 billion investment in computer chip maker Intel Corp. as they look to deepen their involvement in advanced technology and U.S. semiconductor innovation, the companies said Monday. The agreement coincides with unconfirmed reports that the Trump administration is considering a minority government stake in Intel amid the company’s financial struggles. The Silicon Valley company reported a net loss of $2.9 billion in its latest quarter. It is also downsizing and cutting back certain initiatives in an effort to position itself for growth in the artificial intelligence era. As part of the investment, Softbank has agreed to pay $23 per share of Intel’s common stock, slightly discounted from its current share value on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions. Softbank is also collaborating with Foxconn to operate an AI server site in Ohio. “This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,” Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement. The deal would give Softbank a roughly 2% stake in Intel, making the investment holding firm Intel’s fifth largest stakeholder with 87 million shares. Blackrock and Vanguard are the largest, each holding a roughly 9% stake in the company, according to Yahoo! Finance. “Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement. In addition to Softbank, the Trump administration is interested in a potential 10% government stake in Intel following positive talks between the president and Tan, Bloomberg first reported. White House staff did not immediately return requests for comment. After calling for Tan’s resignation earlier this month over alleged ties to Chinese firms, Trump swiftly changed his tune, later posting on Truth Social that the executive’s “success and rise is an amazing story.” Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is making deep cuts as part of an overall revamp. It plans to reduce its core workforce to 75,000 by the end of this year, down from 99,500 as of Dec. 28, 2024. The company is also slowing construction of its $28 billion chip facility in New Albany, Ohio, and scrapping manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland, among other actions. Last week, Intel extended the closing date for the sale of its majority stake in Altera to Sept. 13. The deal is valued at $4.46 billion and would give private equity firm Silver Lake a 51% ownership in the programmable chip company. Approximately 82 workers are being laid off at Altera’s office in San Jose, California, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filing. Their last day is Oct. 8.

Title: Figure’s IPO filing marks Mike Cagney’s return to public markets

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Figure Technology, a 7-year-old blockchain-based lending company, on Monday filed for an IPO of its Class A common stock on Nasdaq, saying in its IPO paperwork that its revenue rose 22.4% to $191 million in the six months ended June 30, and that it reported a profit of $29 million in the same period, compared with a loss of $13 million a year earlier. The filing offers a chance at vindication for Figure co-founder Mike Cagney, who previously built SoFi before leaving the personal finance platform in 2017 following sexual harassment allegations. SoFi went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger and has done pretty well as a public company — its stock is up over 200% in the past year, and its revenue rose 44% in the second quarter of 2025. Since its founding in 2018, Figure has established itself as one of the bigger players in blockchain-based lending, claiming more than 160 partners for its loan origination system and capital marketplace. Figure claims to be the largest non-bank provider of home equity lines of credit. The company, which Cagney founded with his wife June Ou, uses blockchain technology through its Provenance blockchain to speed along approvals for home equity loans, mortgage refinancing, and student and personal loans. In May, Figure said it was also expanding into cryptocurrency lending, signing a financing agreement with Victory Park Capital for what Figure described as the industry’s first securitized pool of crypto-backed loans. That product allows asset owners to borrow against their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%. Terms of that deal with Victory Park were not disclosed. Cagney has a history of ambitious regulatory moves. As TechCrunch reported in late 2020, during the last days of the first Trump administration, Figure applied for a U.S. national bank charter that would have let it accept uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000 from accredited investors while avoiding traditional FDIC and Federal Reserve oversight. The approach could have established a template for other fintech and retail companies to obtain non-traditional bank charters and offer lucrative financial products while avoiding such oversight, but Figure withdrew its application last year amid broader fintech industry challenges. The company has undergone major leadership and organizational changes in the meantime. In April 2024, Figure appointed Michael Tannenbaum, former COO of Brex, as CEO. Tannenbaum previously worked with Cagney as SoFi’s chief revenue officer. And in an unusual corporate maneuver, Cagney spun off Figure Markets in early 2024, creating a standalone digital asset exchange for crypto trading, crypto-backed loans, and stablecoins. But just over a year later, in July, Figure reversed course and smooshed the two entities back together. The company says the strategy positions it to capture a huge and growing opportunity in real-world asset tokenization. (Real-world asset tokenization involves converting traditional assets like mortgages, real estate, or loans — even art — into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain networks. Heavyweight financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are among those who have recently entered the space.) It’s worth noting that this is not Figure’s first attempt at going public. The company previously planned to list via a merger with a SPAC called Figure Acquisition Corp., but the deal got scrapped due to rising interest rates and redemption rates, among other challenges. The blank check company was later delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Figure, whose backers include Apollo Global Management and Ribbit Capital, also failed to complete a planned merger with mortgage lender Homebridge Financial Services in 2022, citing regulatory delays 10 months after the tie-up was announced. The IPO filing is no surprise to industry observers. For one, Figure — which last raised $200 million in 2021 at a $3.2 billion valuation — announced weeks ago that it had filed a confidential statement for an IPO. Further, the timing aligns with a growing wave of crypto-related companies seeking public listings, encouraged by the wildly successful debut of Circle Internet Group back in June, and the Trump administration’s full-bodied support for the cryptocurrency sector and related legislation. Circle’s shares soared more than 500% in their first two weeks on the public market. Crypto exchange Bullish has added to the momentum as its shares more than doubled on its first day of trading last week. On Friday, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange Gemini filed for an IPO despite reporting a $282.5 million net loss in the first half of 2025. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities are serving as the lead bookrunners for Figure’s IPO. The number of shares to be offered and their price range have not yet been determined.

Title: Why yearslong bear market slumps may be a thing of the past

Time Published: 2025-08-19T09:30:02Z

Probably no other term strikes the kind of fear into investors that "bear market" does. The phrase invokes imagery of the 2008 financial crisis, the dot-com bust in 2000, and the 1929 crash leading into the Great Depression. In all of those cases, wealth evaporated in months and wasn't rebuilt for years. But is there really that much to fear anymore when it comes to bear markets, or declines of at least 20%? Sure, no one likes a significant market pullback, but if you stay invested, there's evidence that they may not be all that painful — and that the long, drawn-out, yearslong ruts in the market may be a thing of the past. That's according to Hank Smith, the director and head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust, which manages and consults on $15.3 billion of assets. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Smith laid out the main reason bear markets might be more short-lived going forward: A significant imbalance in the supply of shares on the market and demand for them. A few decades ago, the number of publicly listed firms in the US was over 7,000, he said. Now it's under 4,000. This number has also been shrinking relative to the US population. There are about 13 publicly listed companies per million people today, compared to 30 companies in 1996. At the same time, there is a record amount of cash — $7 trillion in money market funds — on the sidelines, he said. What's more, stock buybacks have been generally on the rise, lowering the supply of stocks available for investors to buy. In the first quarter of this year, there were $55.3 billion in stock buybacks. In the first quarter of 2019, by comparison, that number was $12.8 billion. In the first quarter of 2000, there were $7.9 billion. When there are fewer stocks available to be traded, prices tend to be more volatile. "There's been a real reduction in many companies of their shares outstanding," Smith said. "I think that's a big reason why you don't get these elongated periods of two to three years to recover from a bear market." He added: "It really is the result of supply and demand. I don't think it's much more complicated than that." Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said last week that this is the "best investing environment ever" partly due to this dynamic. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said in an interview with CNBC. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Alex Morris, the chief investment officer at F/M Investments, also recently discussed supply and demand dynamics with Business Insider. Despite a laundry list of risks to stocks — including the impact of tariffs and high valuations — the insatiable demand from investors for stocks likely means the market will continue marching higher, he said. "There's a lot of dollars floating around and they need to go somewhere," he said. "They're going to the equity market." While the sample size is small, there are a couple of pieces of evidence supporting Smith's theory, he said: the 2020 and 2022 market crashes, when the market fell 35% and 25%, respectively. In each instance, the market regained fresh all-time highs in a year or less. Of course, there were other factors at play, like unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in 2020 and the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. "This isn't like bear markets a generation or two ago that sometimes it took years to get back to the highwater mark," Smith said. "These bear markets are followed by very, very swift, powerful bull moves." Jump to

Title: Letters: Ukrainians just need to look to Crimea to see what reality of a ‘deal’ would be

Russian president Vladimir Putin wants to hold as much territory as possible. Photo: AP Just imagine this scenario. An aggravated burglary has taken place and your children and belongings have been taken. The leader of the pack agrees to stop assaulting you – if you let them keep what they have already taken. They may consider permitting you to install enhanced security measures in the future. Incidentally, life is hell for Ukrainians in Crimea. “Special measures” and tribunals have been set up to deal with any dissent. How did we get it so wrong? Daniel Smith, Blackrock, Co Dublin America is winning the war in Ukraine. Russia spends 7.1pc of its GDP on defence, double the US level. Russia has suffered a million casualties; the US arms industry is booming as Europe re-arms. Nato is buying US equipment to send to Ukraine. Russia has lost half its foreign income from oil and gas. The longer the war goes on, the more Russia is weakened and America is strengthened. John Doherty, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall Reports of Donald Trump’s Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, conducted not over hard diplomacy but filet mignon, halibut Olympia and green salad, ought to chill Europe more than amuse it. What is at stake is not the menu, but the spectacle of two men deciding the fate of Ukraine without Ukraine present (‘As Trump bows to Putin, Europe must prepare for the worst’, Irish Independent, August 18). The wider danger lies in the precedent. If borders and sovereignty can be redrawn in a dinner meeting, international law is reduced to table talk. The extrapolation is clear: once this becomes an acceptable mode of negotiation, other authoritarian leaders will be emboldened to test the same weakness. The prediction is bleaker still. A Ukraine carved up in Alaska may be only the first course. Moldova, the Baltics, even Taiwan, could follow as Moscow and Beijing take note of Washington’s willingness to appease under the guise of expedience. Europe, then, must prepare for the worst. To dine with Putin is one thing; to digest his terms is quite another. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Watching world politicians waffling reminds me of what the British parliamentarian Pitt the Elder said: “There is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.” John Finegan, Bailieborough, Co Cavan The recent death of actor Terence Stamp reminds me of his wonderful performance in the movie Far From The Madding Crowd. Sad indeed that fellow actors in that movie, Peter Finch and Alan Bates are also since departed. It’s nice to note that the female lead, Julie Christie, is hale and hearty at 85. Indeed by his own admission, singer Tony Christie was so impressed by her, that he adopted her surname. Is there a greater compliment? Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Fionnán Sheahan writes that should former minister Heather Humphreys decide to enter the race for the Áras, she might be called on to explain “why she stepped away from politics” recently (‘Heather Humphreys is a better candidate but Simon Harris is a liability to campaign’, Irish Independent, August 18). One thing is certain, the response from the Monaghan woman will be straight and true. The office of president is “above politics”. And rightly so. Though there are those who have lost the run of themselves while holding high office, causing no end of concern for our “ordinary” political masters, as well as for the people they represent. Another contender, it’s been widely reported, has expressed “distrust” of the UK, France and Germany ­recently. Not a great start for an aspiring head of State. The incumbent has been known to “cross the constitutional boundary” more than once during his almost 14 years in the Phoenix Park. Let’s hope the next holder of the “highest office” maintains some apolitical equilibrium, save for those times that necessitate presidential intervention. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan It was worrying reading last week that a study found that for under-18s with eating disorders there was a 121pc rise in hospitalisations between 2018 and 2022 – from 170 admissions in 2018 to 375 in 2022 – with a sharp spike during the pandemic. Eating disorders are complex ­medical conditions that not only affect the young person concerned but also their loved ones, family and friends. It strikes me that wraparound care is essential, requiring an increase in investment at a national level. Not every treatment will work successfully for every person that presents at a hospital, or is diagnosed with an eating disorder. If any reader, or professional working with young people, wants an insight into this issue, I strongly recommend Evanna Lynch’s memoir: The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting. It is a harrowing, haunting, honest and unflinching account, and yet a beautifully crafted read that reflects the author’s own journey with an eating disorder that she ultimately overcomes. Let us hope these figures do not continue to rise. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo The recent attacks on members of the Indian community are abhorrent. They are also, as noted by many commentators, puzzling, as the ­Indian community continues to ­contribute so much to Irish society. The fact that they are puzzling does not make them more abhorrent. All racist attacks are abhorrent, regardless of whether the target community contributes economically or not. Chants of “Get them Out” at anti-immigration protests may legitimise and encourage these appalling attacks. We all need to be careful with our language and not tolerate any racism, taunts, slurs or “jokes”.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin Adoption Grows But Success Comes With Risks

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/18/2025 8:33:53 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Quote of the week: “Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement, and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.” - Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman of Google. Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012).

In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple .

Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers.

Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years.

Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years.

So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust.

The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week.

If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile.

For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week.

If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Title: UBS Strategists Warn of ‘Overheating Risk’ Around AI Investments

Δ UBS strategists wrote this in a Monday (Aug. 18) note in which they said private credit lenders are becoming an important source of capital for the industry, Bloomberg reported Monday. Private debt loaned to the technology sector increased by $100 billion over the past 12 months, reaching a total of $450 billion, while business development companies’ tech lending leapt from $80 billion to $150 billion, the UBS note said, per the report. The demand for this capital is driven by tech companies’ spending on AI data center construction and other AI development costs, according to the report. “This phenomenon could sustain significant growth plans for AI and other hyperscaler companies, sowing the seeds of an upside scenario and increasing overheating risk,” the UBS strategists led by Matthew Mish wrote in the note, per the report. Microsoft said in a July 30 earnings report that its capital expenditures are projected to exceed $30 billion in the first quarter to meet the rising infrastructure needs driven by strong demand for cloud and AI. During the fiscal year ended June 30, Microsoft opened new data centers across six continents and now has more than 400 facilities in 70 regions. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a July 30 earnings call. PYMNTS reported July 15 that Google, Meta, Blackstone and Coreweave are planning to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI data centers, as the arms race heats up to build the computing power needed by this advanced technology. A month earlier, AWS said it would spend at least $20 billion to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in Pennsylvania. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX. Microsoft and BlackRock launched the fund last year to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities.

August 18, 2025 16:50 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (Nasdaq: FFAI) (“FF”, “Faraday Future”, or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced its financial results for its second quarter 2025. The Company highlighted several key metrics that underscore both the operational execution and financial position, as well as its significant progress in its FX brand and product development. The Company also provided an update on subsequent events, FX Super One MPV reveal, “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy, and its outlook for the remainder of 2025. SUMMARY The Company made meaningful progress in operations, strengthened its business and financial fundamentals, and advanced the strategic execution of its AI-driven mobility roadmap. FF held its first FX vehicle launch event by unveiling two groundbreaking global-first products, the FX Super One EAI-MPV and the FF Super EAI F.A.C.E. System, alongside the FF EAI Embodied AI Agent 6x4 Architecture, in Los Angeles on July 17, 2025. The non-binding reservations for the FX Super One topped 4,000 units by the end of the quarter, and increased to over 10,000 units as of July 31, 2025, suggesting strong potential demand for this vehicle, underscoring the effectiveness of the B2B2C co-creation sales model, and reaffirming FF’s mass-market strategy. FF also received recognition from Mariah Carey, the best-selling female artist of all time, by including both the FF 91 2.0 and the FFZERO1 concept car in her latest music video, and who will become a new owner of the FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance. FF’s Hanford plant has completed production and delivery of the FF91 P20 model and continues with subsequent vehicle production. Additionally, FX Super One has officially entered the parts procurement and production preparation phase at the Hanford factory, moving into trial production. Additionally, the Company officially released version 2.00.58 of FF 91 via OTA, completed FMVSS testing for FX, and submitted a patent registration for the Super One EAI-Face product. The Company looks to supercharge its workforce by adding additional jobs in the coming years, as it plans to ramp up its new FX vehicle program, which is targeted to begin assembly in Hanford by the end of 2025. This development will enable the delivery of high-quality career opportunities. Additionally, Faraday Future plans to invest an additional approximately $100 million into its U.S. operations in the next 9-12 months, with commitments to research and development, and infrastructure, subject to securing the necessary financing. In capital and investor relations, FF was added to the Russell 3000 Index—a key milestone that enhances FF’s visibility and credibility among institutional investors, analysts, and the broader market. Top-tier international fund managers, Vanguard and BlackRock, continued to increase their holdings in FFAI, with both firms growing their positions by over 500% by June 30, 2025, compared to Q4 2024. Internally, FF launched and started executing its 10b5-1 executive stock purchase plans, reflecting FF executives’ personal commitment to the company’s future and aim to align management’s interests with stockholders. FF also secured approximately $105 million in new cash financing commitments, subject to certain closing conditions, which will support the launch of FX Super One, and accelerate development and distribution efforts for the FF and FX brands and AI-related technologies. FF also achieved a key milestone in the Middle East during the second quarter by completing the handover ceremony for FF’s new facility in Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone, further advancing FF’s presence across the Middle East and North Africa region. On the operational side, FF strengthened its execution by welcoming back its Founder, YT Jia, who rejoined the Company this past quarter as Co-CEO. His leadership will further drive both operational and capital fundamentals while reinforcing market confidence. In addition, FF implemented continuous improvement measures across the Company, which have already delivered significant results in cost reduction, efficiency gains, and streamlined operations. RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2025 In summary, the quarter reflects measured progress in advancing financial discipline and operational execution. FF continues to allocate resources to its most critical priorities, while managing capital effectively and maintaining flexibility for long-term growth. Efforts to better align expenses with current business needs have strengthened the foundation for future stability and financial stability. Additionally, the global unveiling of the FX Super One on July 17, 2025, is an important step in advancing FF’s strategic roadmap. The Company held an event in Pebble Beach on August 16, where it introduced its Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge ecosystem strategy, designed to integrate traditional operations with emerging digital platforms. A central component of this strategy is the Company’s new C10 Treasury product, which establishes a direct connection between real-world business operations and on-chain assets. As one of the first U.S.-listed companies to introduce this capability, FF is creating a new growth paradigm by bridging Web2 and Web3. The C10 Treasury product is expected to strengthen the Company’s financial and technological foundation while reinforcing its ability to drive innovation across both ecosystems. Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer, spoke highly of the event by delivering the opening speech. 2025 OUTLOOK For the second half of 2025, FF will continue to focus on driving technological innovation, maintaining financial discipline, and driving long-term growth and success in the EV market. The Company expects to hit the FX year-end off-line target in the U.S. and anticipate the first FX Super One will roll off the production line in the Middle East by the end of the year as well. FF will continue to execute on the Company’s seven tier-one strategic goals and pillars, from S1 to S7, and uphold the “Shareholders First” philosophy by putting all its efforts towards building trust with investors and fully regaining their confidence. “In the second quarter, we achieved several notable capital markets milestones and also continued to strengthen our operating efficiencies and cost control measures,” said Matthias Aydt, Global Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “We are excited for many of our recent developments as well, including the recent FX Super One unveiling in LA on July 17 as well as the success of our recent Pebble Beach event on August 16, where we introduced our Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge ecosystem strategy, designed to integrate traditional operations with emerging digital platforms. FX continues to build strong momentum with its innovative B2B and B2C sales model, and we are encouraged by the early pre-order numbers for the FX Super One.” EARNINGS WEBCAST Faraday Future management will host a webcast today, August 18, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time (5:00 p.m. Pacific time).

Title: World Economic Forum Doubles Down on Climate and ESG, Lets Embattled Ex-Leader Off Hook

(Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." Even before President Donald Trump’s reelection, investors were leaving the woke environmental, social, and governance agenda like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Yet, those rats appear to have a few life rafts remaining, and the World Economic Forum seems intent on shoring up the ESG agenda. The World Economic Forum is a conspiracy theorist’s wet dream. The forum hosts the annual Davos gathering of world leaders in Switzerland. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the forum’s founder and chairman, Klaus Schwab, wrote “COVID-19: The Great Reset,” a manual for using the pandemic crisis to upend all of society. The forum also promoted the prediction “You will own nothing and be happy.” This nonprofit organization, supported by 1,000 member multinational companies, represents the woke managerial elite. The World Economic Forum supports the claims that climate change poses a catastrophic threat to humanity, that institutions must be altered to root out “systemic racism,” and that society must be upended to kowtow to the demands of men who claim to identify as women and vice versa. It uses the notion of “stakeholder capitalism” to say that a company’s goal isn’t just to provide a return on investment for shareholders, but to make the world a better—read “more woke”—place. Meat will be a special treat. Read more: https://t.co/RiQP6tpkfp pic.twitter.com/7BcRHgnWTx The elites pushing these agendas brand those who disagree as “reactionary” or “hateful.” Yet, the World Economic Forum faced its own problems. Whistleblowers filed a complaint after The Wall Street Journal published an investigation claiming the Forum’s culture was hostile to female and black employees. Schwab, the founder, stepped down in April amid an investigation into claims he had misused Forum funds. This turmoil may have represented an opportunity for the World Economic Forum to chart a new course, rejecting its woke bureaucratic mentality and listening to the worldwide populist movement. It’s not just Trump: Populism is growing in France, Germany, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands, and beyond. Businesses are also rejecting ESG. A host of companies have pulled out of the Corporate Equality Index maintained by the Human Rights Campaign, which has acted like a kind of LGBTQ+ mafia. Corporate America is outwardly rejecting the language of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” after Trump rightly issued executive orders interpreting racial quotas as a form of illegal discrimination. Yet the World Economic Forum is rejecting the anti-woke trend. Not only did the forum give its founder an outgoing commendation, but it also tapped the man who has long been the face of the ESG movement to help steer the ship. In a statement Friday, the forum said it concluded “there is no substantial evidence of material wrongdoing” from Schwab or his wife, Hilde Schwab. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment, rather than intent of misconduct,” the World Economic Forum concluded. It also announced that Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a former chief executive of Nestle who served as the interim chairman of the board, would be stepping down. Two men replaced him as co-chairs of the board: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Swiss billionaire André Hoffmann. Fink has long been the face of ESG. Under his leadership, BlackRock committed to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in March 2021, pledging to offset its greenhouse gas emissions completely by 2050. His 2021 letter praised as “protests for racial justice” the Black Lives Matter protests that had devolved into riots in the summer of 2020. He said, “No organization is immune from the challenges posed by racial bias.” Fink has attempted to walk back some of this activism in recent years, as his firm faced backlash not just from conservatives, but from state treasurers who moved to withdraw state investment funds from BlackRock. As far back as 2023, Fink stopped using the term ESG, claiming it had been “weaponized.” BlackRock deleted DEI statements in its latest annual report. The company exited the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition earlier this year, while claiming that the move would not alter “the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock is not giving up on climate alarmism, however. It has shifted from ESG to “transition investing,” directing funds to companies that aim to operate using smaller amounts of carbon-based fuel. Furthermore, BlackRock still has a 100% score with the Human Rights Campaign. If Fink were truly committed to leaving ESG in the past, BlackRock would separate from the Human Rights Campaign and abandon climate alarmism. Like Fink, Hoffmann has embraced the “stakeholder capitalism” model and combined it with climate alarmism. The drug company Roche Holding, where Hoffman serves as vice chairman, published an interview with Hoffman in 2022 titled “No one can deny the existence of climate change.” In that interview, Hoffman said, “Roche employees have to know that we aren’t here just to make money; we are here to help people in a sustainable, lasting way,” such that the company grows “in harmony with nature and society.” As the world increasingly moves on from ESG, the World Economic Forum is doubling down. The woke movement may be on the outs for now, but the threat it poses isn’t going away anytime soon. Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

US market dominance and Ethereum's impressive gains highlight the evolving crypto investment landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Digital asset investment products pulled in $3.75 billion in net inflows last week, marking one of the largest weekly gains in history, according to CoinShares latest weekly report. The renewed appetite follows several weeks of tepid market sentiment and coincides with a recent crypto price rally. Notably, these inflows lifted total assets under management (AuM) to a fresh record of $244 billion. Ethereum emerged as the clear leader in the market, drawing $2.87 billion in inflows, about 77% of the weekly total. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, noted that most of last week’s inflows concentrated in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum fund (ETHA), which accounted for over $2.3 billion of the fresh capital in the funds. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF and manages over $10 billion in assets, according to SoSo Value data. The BlackRock fund’s record performance has contributed significantly to ETH-focused funds’ accumulation of a record $11 billion in new capital this year. Conversely, Bitcoin-focused funds have repeatedly seen smaller flows in recent weeks, highlighting the shift in investor interest toward Ethereum. This was unchanged last week when the BTC-focused funds registered $522 million in new capital. Notably, CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum’s YTD inflows now represent 29% of its AuM, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the largest asset in terms of AuM, standing at $180.7 billion compared to Ethereum’s $37.7 billion. Meanwhile, short Bitcoin products saw $4 million in inflows as prices dipped below $120,000, triggering significant losses for leveraged long traders. Outside of the top two major cryptocurrencies, XRP and Solana continue to remain the top altcoin pick for institutional investors. Last week, funds focused on these digital assets registered over $300 million in combined fresh capital. This brings their year-to-date flows to over $2 billion, and their funds also manage more than $5 billion in assets. Regionally, the United States accounted for nearly all of the inflows, contributing $3.73 billion, around 99% of the total. Other markets recorded smaller gains, including Canada with $33.7 million, Hong Kong with $20.9 million, and Australia with $12.1 million. However, these gains were partially offset by outflows from Sweden and Brazil, which saw $49.9 million and $10.6 million withdrawn, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The TeX Factor For Traditional And Digital Asset Businesses
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuasmeltzer/2025/08/18/the-tex-factor-for-traditional-and-digital-asset-businesses/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByJoshua D. Smeltzer ByJoshua D. Smeltzer, Contributor. Full disclosure, I’m an adopted Texan. I wasn’t born or raised in Texas, but my family and I moved from Washington, D.C. in 2007 and I have called it home ever since. Although this fact may, reasonably, color my views, it has been a remarkable place to watch economic growth and the adoption of the digital asset economy. In general, Texas has always been a business-friendly environment. However, a series of recent moves by Texas lawmakers shows a deliberate effort to establish a business and, specifically, a digital asset business destination. Texas has embraced digital asset innovation - Bitcoin mining, financial services, and Web3, as well as blockchain and associated other companies in this new and growing industry. Most recently, Texas established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin reserve which allows the investment of public funds into digital assets. As expected, this will be managed by the Texas Comptroller. This creates a very conducive environment for digital asset and other traditional companies. Another significant step in making Texas a catalyst for economic growth is the creation of the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) that intends to open in 2026. Texas is proving that southern hospitality extends not only to the people who visit, but to businesses as well. Full disclosure, again, I’m a litigator handling corporate, tax, white-collar, and other financial disputes. Although inherently disruptive, litigation is sometimes the only way for parties to resolve disputes and be able to carry on their respective business. Even with the best. Texas has legislated a two-phase approach: creating laws that will reduce disputes and also creating specific courts. The intention is to allow for a more streamlined approach to resolving complex business disputes outside of the regular state court system. On May 14, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 into law that immediately became effective. The legislation codified the “business judgment rule” which created a presumption that the directors and officers of corporations acted in good faith, on an informed basis, in furtherance of the interests of the corporation, and in obedience to the law and the corporation’s governing documents when taking action on matters of the corporation’s business. In order to establish a cause of action the corporation or its shareholders must rebut these presumptions and prove a breach of their duties involving fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act (i.e. outside scope of powers), or a knowing violation of law. Senate Bill 29 also codified the right of a Texas entity to include a provision in its operating documents waiving a right to a jury for any “internal entity claims.” In a new and developing industry, especially one based on new technologies like Distributed Ledger Technology and other technology related to digital assets, directors and officer are more likely to exercise “business judgment” on how to operate and grow the company. If that judgment is subject to easy lawsuits second-guessing hard choices, or using hindsight analysis, it can hold back innovative decision-making or paralyze a growing company while it waits for lengthy litigation to conclude. The new law allows the governing documents to require that internal entity claims be brought in Texas courts, including the newly established Texas Business Courts. The Texas Business Court is a statewide, specialized trial court created to resolve certain complex business disputes. The Texas Business Courts opened on September 1, 2024 with the judges appointed by the governor for a two-year term (instead of elected). The law required that these judges must have had at least 10 years of practice in civil business litigation, business transaction law, or service as a civil judge. The new courts have limited jurisdiction (e.g. larger amounts in controversy, specific issues such as corporate governance, etc.) which means a smaller docket of cases and the presumption of faster resolution. Since the business courts are still relatively new, it will take time to determine exactly what types of business disputes benefit from this specialization. All eyes are on Texas to determine if time is saved by the smaller, more specialized, caseload. Backed by financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has the funding to create a pro-business, innovation-friendly alternative to traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. TXSE is, of course, focused on traditional financial products but has the opportunity to differentiate itself as a digital asset focused exchange. BlackRock runs popular Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the presumption that similar products will be offered on TXSE. Also, publicly traded companies involved in Bitcoin mining are already available on other exchanges. For examples, popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global was recently added to the S&P 500. Circle Internet Group, a stablecoin market leader, recently applied to establish a national trust bank in anticipation of meeting requirements under recent stablecoin legislation to integrate digital assets into the broader financial system. Today, there is a lot of movement in traditional equity markets to incorporate digital asset financial products. This is happening just as a new national stock exchange, TXSE, is seeking to provide an alternative to traditional platforms. Thus, TXSE has the greatest opportunity to truly integrate both digital asset and traditional markets since it starts with a cleaner slate than the older established stock exchanges. Texas wasn’t the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, but its version did go a little further than similar legislation. The first such law was incorporated in New Hampshire, but did not that state’s reserve to be funded by public dollars. However, on June 20, 2025, Senate Bill 21, created the state-managed Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This legislation outlines the intent to use the digital asset reserve as a financial buffer, hedging against inflation and economic volatility. The Texas Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by airdrops, legislative appropriations, revenue dedicated by general law, cryptocurrencies acquired through forks, and investment earnings or rewards. This is a significant difference, since Texas has decided to put its own money at risk as a sign to digital asset companies that it is willing to take the same risks on this new asset and industry. At the federal level, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also indicated a willingness to potentially “acquire more Bitcoin" to increase the United States’ Bitcoin reserve. Texas is one of the largest economies in the world, and it has already committed to invest in Bitcoin as a method of protecting the finances for its citizens. That is unique among other government institutions - at least for now. When I first moved from Washington, D.C. to Texas, I was a bit concerned that my east coast personality might not mesh well with the local culture. However, the cliche’ of southern hospitality has proven true, both personally and professionally. I’ve watched the same welcoming attitude apply to many businesses that have decided to also make Texas their adopted homes. This has included many digital asset and blockchain based companies during a time when it was not as mainstream to be operating those types of ventures. In the best adopted Texan spirit I can muster - Y’all should come and check out Texas.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Full Content:
Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard's Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will "redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives." Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as "a blueprint for a hope-filled future," while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could "ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most." Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, "Heroic Accounting," we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting's core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an "extremely high" risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI's methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world's poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues "We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits." But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager's employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI's approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm's measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country's robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania's low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI's method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. "Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous," write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. "Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment." Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, "Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, 'It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.'" Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian's wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don't need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.
