Title: No, Progressives Don’t Want “Purity.” They Just Want Some Courage.

Mainstream Democrats use dozens of old catchphrases that suggest they’re out of step. “When they go low, we go high,” for example, sounded fine when Michelle Obama first said it in 2016, but it passed its sell-by date almost the next day. For quite some time, the Democratic Party, which is still closely aligned with banks and billionaires, has needed to go anywhere but high. But it’s the meme of the “purity test” that should spike real worry that the Democratic Party is missing the moment right now. Party standard-bearers still use the phrase as a slur to trivialize legitimate questions from the left. It’s a petty and defensive move, and it comes across as a refusal to engage with the most obvious and urgent questions facing the party and the country. A recent case in point involved New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Booker is a tireless legislator who two weeks ago sponsored a promising bill to provide support for family caregivers, but he has sometimes been criticized for his coziness with Big Tech and Big Pharma. In October, the popular firebrand Jennifer Welch of the podcast I’ve Had It asked Booker why he and other Democrats had turned to “Neville Chamberlain–type appeasement” with President Trump. As just one example, Welch cited Booker’s confirmation of one of Trump’s shadiest ambassadors, Charlie Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s father-in-law; a felon and a billionaire real-estate developer from Booker’s home state of New Jersey. “What do you have to say about the capitulation that you participated in?” Booker smiled. He tried to seem unflappable. He then waved away Welch as “holding up a purity test.” “That’s such bullshit,” Welch shot back. “It’s not a purity test. It’s, Are we in this fight? Are we being beholden to corporations and corporate interests? Or, Are we really the party of the working class?” Welch was right. “Purity test” is bullshit, and it’s a deflection Democrats must stop using. Challenges to politicians on major issues, including foreign policy, acceptance of corporate money, and failure to keep ICE out of cities—these are not puritanical attacks on their lifestyles. They are credible allegations that the party must acknowledge and address: that Democrats are allies of Republican hawks like Liz Cheney, valets for private equity, and hopeless incrementalists on social justice. (“Never forget that slavery lasted over 200 years,” said the comedian Christina Brown, playing a generic Democrat, in an extremely popular video sketch. “Because progress takes time.” Another “Democrat” in the sketch, this one played by Prance, added, “We’re going to stand up for Black people. Blackrock. Blackwater mercenaries. Blackstone. Black sites. Black ops.”) To dismiss the concerns of progressives is to deepen the demoralization that many of them have felt since 2015, when, as they see it, Democrats put Trump in office by keeping Senator Bernie Sanders and his then-insurgent socialism off the ticket. Right or wrong, the Democrats’ failure to nominate Sanders in 2016 is the origin story of the modern left, and they’re sticking to it. That cursed election is not available for relitigation. So now it’s up to older Democrats, who came up believing that unfettered capitalism was the country’s one true path, to stop trying to censor this generation of liberals, and start learning from them. And if the Democratic leadership doesn’t want to watch satire on TikTok to understand their own party, they can at least look at the polls. According to Gallup in September, fully 66 percent of Democrats view socialism, by that name, favorably. Bullishness on socialism is up a whopping 16 points since 2010, Obama’s heyday. At the same time, per the Gallup poll, only 17 percent of Democrats view big business favorably, while—and this is especially surprising—a mere 36 percent of independents do. Anti-monopoly views are clearly no longer the province only of sullen Occupy alumni. Look at those numbers. The vast majority of the gettable electorate can now be spooked by even a hint that the Democratic Party is ignoring the people in favor of rich or ideological donors, corporate interests, Black Rock, Blackstone, and billionaire PACs. The purity-test dodge seems to have started during the presidential primary of 2019, when Barack Obama told a room of Bay Area donors that Democrats running for president should not be “woke” or engage in “cancel culture.” (Why did that daft formulation waylay so many minds, institutions, and opinion pages?) Nor, Obama said, should Democrats run on positions that could turn off the center and the center-right. What those positions were exactly he didn’t say, but good guesses include taxing the rich and downscaling the police. “I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections,” he told the Silicon Valley crowd. “Because, you know what, the country is complicated.” Complicated? Was that 2019-speak for something like “hopping with billionaires who must not be taxed”? If by “complicated” Obama had meant the country was increasingly socialist, he would have come closer to the mark. But in those days “complexity” was all about trying to seduce Republicans and the rich. A few months after Obama’s fundraising event, Pete Buttigieg, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, reprised the purity-test dodge on the debate stage. Senator Elizabeth Warren, also a candidate, pressed him on his ties to robber-baron donors, and he responded that this wasn’t fair game. To mention the opulence of his donor parties, he said, was nothing but a “purity test.” Five years later, sounding out politicians for their connections to billionaires doesn’t seem so persnickety. With their massively successful “Fight Oligarchy” national tour, which has drawn 261,100 attendees so far, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and good old Bernie have skillfully energized the party’s progressive grassroots and quietly reoriented the whole Democratic enterprise. Progressive Democrats no longer just oppose the bottomlessly corrupt billionaire in the White House. They oppose all billionaires, of every party, as they are all bottomlessly corrupt—and have long rigged politics and the economy to consolidate power, exploit workers, pursue white nationalism, and wage war. If Democrats, when asked, can’t commit to opposing oligarchy, they’re not failing purity tests. They’re hiding a dangerous and right-wing worldview, and Americans deserve to know about it. Socialism may have been sidelined in 2015, and again in 2019, but it’s on all the tickets now. Virginia Heffernan is the author of the Substack newsletter Magic + Loss.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has retracted his earlier statements criticizing Bitcoin (BTC) as a tool for money laundering and theft. Since his criticism, BlackRock has become the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with Fink evolving into a strong advocate of the premier cryptocurrency. After previously taking a hard stance toward Bitcoin, Larry Fink has reiterated a change of heart toward the largest cryptocurrency. In a recent interview, the BlackRock CEO admitted that his former views on Bitcoin were wrong, and new insights have forced a shift in perspective for digital assets.According to Fink, interactions with thousands of clients, including government leaders, as the BlackRock CEO revealed the upsides of Bitcoin. For Fink, Bitcoin is now an international asset class with the BlackRock CEO underscoring BTC’s inflation-hedging and borderless properties in several interviews. “I had very strong views,” said Fink. “But that doesn’t mean I’m not wrong. My thought process always evolves.” Back in 2017, Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an “index of money laundering” while dismissing it as speculation and “not a real investment.” In 2018, Fink noted that BlackRock had no interest in a Bitcoin ETF, maintaining that its clients were not keen on cryptocurrency exposure.Starting in 2020, Fink’s public comments indicated a streak of neutrality. In multiple interviews, the BlackRock CEO acknowledged Bitcoin’s potential but raised concerns over its volatility and dire lack of regulation. In the following years, Fink and BlackRock began paying significant attention to Bitcoin, mulling the possibilities of tokenization using blockchain technology. Things reached a crescendo in 2023 after BlackRock filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF, citing growing clients’ need for BTC exposure. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in early 2024, the ETF recorded a flying start. At the moment, IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $72 billion in assets under management (AUM), reflecting massive institutional interest in the asset class. Barely two years since its launch, Bitcoin ETFs are now BlackRock’s largest revenue drivers, surpassing revenue-generating two-decade-old products for the asset manager. For context, BlackRock manages over 1,600 ETFs globally, with IBIT on course to clinch $100 billion in AUM.

Title: Ripple CEO’s Ultra-Bullish Projection: Bitcoin To Reach $180,000 By End Of 2026

Bitcoin could extend its recent rebound after posting a 7% daily gain on Wednesday, with 2026 likely to be the crypto’s most bullish year yet. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse cited regulatory progress and institutional interest as the secret sauce for Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by the end of 2026. During a recent panel discussion alongside Solana Foundation President Lily Liu and Binance co-CEO Richard Teng as part of Binance Blockchain Week, Ripple boss Brad Garlinghouse boldly projected that the Bitcoin price could grind all the way to $180,000 per coin before the end of next year. “I’ll go out on a limb, and I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000, December 31, 2026,” Garlinghouse postulated, indicating strong optimism about the alpha cryptocurrency’s long-term price trajectory. Bitcoin was trading for $93,216 at publication time, up a meagre 0.1 percentage over the past 24 hours period, CoinGecko data shows. The leading crypto hit a record peak of $126,080 just two months ago before sagging. The Ripple CEO expects 2026 to be the most bullish year for the crypto industry to date due to several factors. “There are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that, as we go into 2026, I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” he opined. First, Garlinghouse notes that after years of being hostile to the crypto sector, the United States has finally achieved regulatory clarity under the Trump administration. This drastic regulatory change, according to him, is significantly undervalued. Garlinghouse then highlighted that renowed Wall Street giants are now foraying the market. Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and now even Vanguard, which previously held a long-standing anti-crypto stance, is now allowing its 50 million clients to invest in regulated digital asset products. Crypto has transitioned beyond mere speculation into real-world utility. More improved interfaces and practical applications indicate that crypto is beginning to solve real problems. Per Garlinghouse, this will buoy a prolonged bull rally. “The last thing I’ll say on this (which I think we’ll probably all agree about) is we’re also seeing real-world applications, where it’s not just about the speculation,” he explained. Other industry pundits are less optimistic. As ZyCrypto reported last month, veteran trader Peter Brandt claimed BTC will not reach $200k by the end of this year as widely tipped by various strategists. For Brandt, the next bull run leading to that price level will take place over four years.

Title: Military preparedness 'best way to avoid war': President Lai

Time Published: 2025-12-05T09:15:08Z

ROC Central News Agency 12/04/2025 02:49 PM Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA) President Lai Ching-te (è³´æ¸ å¾·) said in a U.S. media interview that Taiwan is "working side by side" with other democracies to deter a Chinese invasion and "robust preparations are the best way to avoid war and achieve peace." Speaking in a prerecorded video interview, which aired Wednesday (U.S. time) at The New York Times DealBook Summit, Lai said that "peace is priceless and war has no winners." "While we aspire to peace, we cannot harbor illusions about it," Lai told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin, the Taiwanese president's first foreign media interview since he announced a US$40 billion special defense budget on Nov. 26. "Peace must be secured through strength. This is why we are increasing our defense budget and strengthening our national defense capabilities while also cutting back our economic dependence on China," Lai added. Taiwan's president was one of more than a dozen interviewees at the Times' event, which also featured conversations with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. In the interview, which lasted around 10 minutes, Sorkin asked Lai about China's goal of being capable of "taking Taiwan by force by 2027" and what he thought China's current timeline could be. "Whatever timeline China's People's Liberation Army may have, Taiwan's fundamental principle is that we must be ready first," Lai added, before expressing gratitude to the international community for their support of Taiwan. The well-known American journalist then asked Lai how confident he felt about U.S. President Donald Trump's support for Taiwan. "Our relationship truly is rock solid," Lai said of the long-standing relationship between the two sides, adding that U.S. cooperation with Taiwan has expanded since Trump assumed office. On the Russia-Ukraine war, Lai said Taiwan stands with the people of Ukraine, and that he hopes "this irrational and illegitimate war will be over as soon as possible so that the Ukrainian people will no longer have to suffer." "However, in ending this war, we also hope that Ukraine's national dignity and the well-being of its people will be respected and future conflict will be prevented," Lai explained. Sorkin, a financial columnist for The New York Times and co-anchor of CNBC's business news show "Squawk Box," turned the interview to the topic of semiconductors. Noting the Trump administration's desire to manufacture "40 to 50 percent of all semiconductors in the next couple of years," Sorkin asked whether Lai was concerned about Taiwan potentially being "less valuable" to the U.S. in the future. Lai said that "semiconductors are a global ecosystem" and that he hopes that Taiwan can "support the re-industrialization of the U.S." through investments in the country. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and other Taiwanese semiconductor firms invest in the U.S., Japan, Europe, or "wherever they believe is needed," Lai said. On the question of whether Trump's 40 to 50 percent domestic semiconductor manufacturing goal was realistic or not, Lai said that this would depend on the U.S. government's ability to facilitate land, water and electricity supply, workforce and talent development, and investment incentives. Later in the interview, Lai said that Taiwan's decision around the year 2000 not to relocate its most advanced manufacturing to China was correct. He also said that leaders around the world should work together to "take steps to prevent AI from becoming a bubble" so that the industry can drive long-term global growth.

Title: The Germans Are World Champions for Rearmament

Time Published: 2025-12-05T07:22:28Z

Every year, not only does Santa Claus come around, but also a report on global arms production and trade by SIPRI. SIPRI stands for Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The international peace research institute in Sweden’s capital has now taken a close look at the sales and profits of arms companies[1]. And it turns out that never before in human history has so much money been spent on armaments as it is now. Some of the increases in sales can be described as exorbitant. Or should we say obscene? At a time when sheer deprivation in certain areas, such as Gaza, has reached absolutely unbearable levels; at a time when farmland is becoming infertile and forests are being destroyed; at a time when education and healthcare can no longer keep pace with the increasing challenges – at such a time, many governments have the audacity to literally vaporize more and more taxpayers’ money on armament. This can only be good news for arms manufacturers, their shareholders and asset managers. SIPRI has only included the hundred largest arms manufacturers in its calculations. So these figures do not document the full extent of the economic waste. Nevertheless, for the year 2024, we arrive at the staggering sum of 676 billion dollars that has been diverted from the coffers of the taxpayer solidarity community into the pockets of arms profiteers. That was almost six per cent more than a year earlier. Mind you, we are only talking about the purchase of new weapons and ammunition here. Not the maintenance of equipment and buildings. Not the personnel costs and retirement pensions for former soldiers, the often traumatised or maimed veterans of various perverse excursions to foreign countries. First of all, it is interesting to observe the large regional differences in the purchase of new war toys. It will come as no surprise that US-based arms manufacturers, with an order volume of 336 billion US dollars, account for the lion’s share of the business with 49 per cent. And anyone who already has such a dominant position can be satisfied with year-on-year growth of around four per cent. However, US companies would be wise not to rest on their laurels too much. After all, the relatively slow growth of the US arms industry may well be its own fault. Table leader Lockheed Martin has severely tested the patience of its customers with its F-35 fighter jet. The F-35 is delivered to customers on average three quarters of a year after the promised delivery date. And then the metal bird is significantly more expensive than originally promised. It is precisely this unreliability that is also attributed to other arms manufacturers Made in the USA. This is not exactly helpful for long-term customer loyalty. A study from the United States had already complained in 2009 that the government awards arms contracts without tenders[2]. And that every member of Congress in Washington only approves an arms project if it creates jobs for their constituency. Arms projects are therefore not planned with a view to finding the best technical solution. Instead, the aim is to find a solution that all members of Congress can agree on. It could therefore be that the enormously inflated American war machine is a paper tiger. We will see if this is the case when the US eventually encounters a truly equal opponent. The real action in the arms industry is currently taking place in Europe. The war in Ukraine is seen as a suitable pretext to really show off. As a result, the business of European arms companies rose by 13 per cent in 2024 compared to the previous year. Overall, European killers are represented in the Top One Hundred chart with 151 billion dollars and a 22 per cent market share. Twenty-six European companies share the pie. With BAE Systems, the United Kingdom has a real heavyweight in fourth place in the world rankings with 52.2 billion dollars and growth of 7.7 per cent. With sales of $26 billion and growth of 12 per cent, France has just half the potential of the British. New entry to the charts is the Czechoslovak Group, with a phenomenal 193 per cent increase in sales and a value of $3.6 billion. The Czech arms manufacturer owes this meteoric rise to lucrative orders from Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence contractor JSC Ukrainian Defence Industry posted a 41 per cent increase in sales last year, with a turnover of three billion dollars. Russia, on the other side, has lost market share on the international export market. However, this is being offset by its involvement on the Ukrainian front. The Russian arms industry is concentrated in the state-owned Rostec corporation. However, Rostec’s turnover is only slightly higher than that of French corporations, namely 27.1 billion dollars, with growth of 26 per cent[3]. The Russian defence budget is actually rather modest, and is even set to be reduced next year. In order to inflate the destructive power of the Russian bear, the German media are repeatedly reporting that Russia wants to increase its budget for 2026 to a whopping 12.93 trillion roubles[3]. However, they fail to convert this amount into euros. This is because one rouble is equivalent to one euro cent[4]. The Russians therefore want to spend around 129 billion euros on their defence next year. That is less than a tenth of what the Western community of values spends on its armaments. While Japan and South Korea are also recording fabulous growth with their arms companies, developments in China are moving in the opposite direction. With a total volume of 88.3 billion dollars, Chinese arms companies have suffered a ten per cent decline compared to the previous year. However, this is not the result of an increasingly pacifist attitude in China – unfortunately not. Rather, the Chinese arms industry has been rocked by a huge corruption scandal. Large numbers of senior staff have had to be dismissed. And now a restructuring process is underway that is paralysing the industry for a certain period of time. However, this should have settled down again by next year. You may well have wondered whether, in the heat of the moment, I might have forgotten Germany. Not at all. I am now turning my attention specifically to Germany. This is because the German arms industry stands out in all this arms race madness. Germany has a total of four arms companies in the top one hundred. And only the Czech Republic, as already mentioned, has higher growth rates than Germany. The Diehl Group increased its share by 53 per cent to 2.1 billion dollars. And the much better-known Rheinmetall Group, ranked 20th in the charts, increased its share by 47 per cent to 8.2 billion. Plans assume that Rheinmetall could move up to second place in the ranking of the world’s largest arms companies in a few years. This is very strange, however. German politicians are actively promoting the unilateral restructuring of their own economy towards militarisation. While Germany is showing serious signs of increasing deindustrialisation, the federal government is willingly allowing this undesirable development to happen. It is simply pushing an arms industry as a new model over the flattened civilian economy. And because an exorbitant increase in the military budget cannot be financed from the regular federal budget, they are simply brazenly ignoring the debt brake, which has so far been used to reject pretty much every funding measure in the areas of education, health and infrastructure. A ‘special fund’, i.e. rapid debt accumulation outside and parallel to the federal budget. In the coming fiscal year 2026, 108.2 billion euros are actually to be squandered on armament[5]. Around 80 billion euros will come from the regular federal budget pot. An additional 25 billion euros will come from the so-called special fund. To pay for this, pensioners, among others, will have to tighten their belts. Other areas will also have to tighten their belts. With this model, the German government is following in the footsteps of the United States after the Second World War. At that time, just a few years after the fighting ended, a gigantic military-industrial complex was built up, which gradually stifled the civilian economy more and more. The USA no longer produced for civilian purposes. Everything that was not nailed down was imported: food, consumer goods. Because less and less was being invested in broad-based development, the USA brought in skilled workers from abroad – a phenomenon known as brain drain. The USA could afford to do this because, after the Second World War, it had gathered the rest of the world around it and was able to dictate the rules of the game. With the dollar as the reserve currency, the US was able to gain advantages that no other country in the world is allowed to enjoy. The US was able to determine the terms of the oil trade at its own discretion. And if any country in the world refused to accept the Pax Americana, there were harsh punitive expeditions and regime change manoeuvres. Have the German elites not understood anything? A complete conversion of the economy into a military-industrial complex is something you have to be able to afford. Germany is not the centre of the world. Germany is a decapitated limb of the American power machine. The German military will never be in a position to subjugate other countries and cover them with punitive expeditions. Meanwhile, Germany has repeatedly attempted to become the hegemon in the European Union. However, these attempts have failed miserably time and again, falling short halfway. The attempt to break out of the dead end of deindustrialisation through militarisation is doomed to failure from the outset. We can already write off Germany’s military power as a pitiful ruin. It may be that the failure of this project to establish Germany as a military power will cause the elites to flee, leaving a political vacuum, just as in 1918. If we can counter this militaristic nonsense with a concept of civil society, there will be a unique opportunity for a more humane Germany. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin Dip Attracts Gradual Buying From Sovereign Funds—CEO

Time Published: 2025-12-05T07:00:54Z

Reports have disclosed a sharp rebound in crypto markets this week, with Bitcoin jumping 8% to trade above $93,000 after sliding from lows under $85,000 earlier in the week. Traders are watching the Federal Reserve’s December actions closely as they try to gauge how much liquidity will return to markets. The move pushed bitcoin back within reach of a roughly $2 trillion market cap. According to BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, several sovereign wealth funds have been quietly adding to positions as prices fell from a peak near $126,000. “There are a number of sovereign funds that are standing by…. and they’re buying ‘incrementally’ as the Bitcoin price has retreated from its $126,000 peak,” Fink said. He said these buyers are taking a gradual approach — adding over time rather than making quick bets — and treating holdings as multi-year positions. Reports have disclosed that public funds in Abu Dhabi and Luxembourg have bought into BlackRock’s IBIT bitcoin fund in recent months. Fink warned that markets remain skewed and that volatility will persist while many players remain highly leveraged. Fink has been vocal about tokenization as a major theme for the coming years. Based on reports, he wrote in The Economist that tokenization could grow as quickly as the internet did in its early days, noting that Amazon had only $16 million in sales in 1996. BlackRock, the $10 trillion asset manager he runs, has pushed the idea that a digital wallet could one day hold stocks, bonds and tokenized assets together. Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said some of the largest banks are already working with Coinbase on stablecoins, custody and trading services, though he did not name the banks. According to remarks made at a DealBook event alongside Andrew Ross Sorkin and Brian Armstrong, Fink described bitcoin in emotional terms: ownership often reflects worries about physical safety or financial security. He tied demand to concerns over the debasement of financial assets and rising deficits. Reports have also quoted him warning that the US risks falling behind other governments if it does not speed up adoption of tokenization and other digital tools. US President Donald Trump has similarly warned about competition from China in crypto innovation. Traders are already pricing in a variety of scenarios. Some are betting on a major development in 2026 that could reshape demand; others remain focused on short-term policy moves from the Fed. Bitcoin’s recent 8% gain was the largest daily jump since May, but it came after sharp swings that highlighted how quickly positions can reverse. With significant capital now involved — and big names publicly backing tokenization — the market is likely to see more headline-driven moves.

Title: ECB frets at prospect of Trump ally running US central bank

Time Published: 2025-12-05T03:14:00Z

A politicized Fed could be bad news for central banks everywhere, officials fear. AI generated Text-to-speech European Central Bank officials are growing increasingly jittery as Kevin Hassett — a close ally of President Donald Trump with very little central bank experience — emerges as the frontrunner to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve. A report last week by Bloomberg described Hassett, whom Trump picked at the start of the year to head the White House National Economic Council, as the “emerging front-runner” to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Hassett’s rise has set off alarm bells in Frankfurt. European officials fear Hassett, under pressure from his boss in the White House, could push the Fed into cutting interest rates far more aggressively than Powell — even though that might risk unleashing another wave of inflation that could ripple out across the world. “If markets obtain a firm belief that the new [Fed chair] is subject to fiscal or any other dominance at the expense of the inflation target, there will be capital flight from the U.S. and an erosion of the value of the dollar with serious consequences worldwide — including higher inflation,” one ECB official said. Like others interviewed for this story, the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “There is a possibility that the U.S. will have some inflationary bias ... because of the political involvement,” a second ECB official warned. The Bloomberg report came just before Thanksgiving, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had whittled down a long roster of candidates into a shorter list. Later during the holiday weekend, aboard Air Force One, Trump told reporters that “I know who I’m gonna pick,” but he told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he wouldn’t announce his decision until early in the new year. Prediction markets such as Polymarket have made Hassett the odds-on favorite since then. “For Trump, Hassett would be the best choice,” a third ECB official agreed, noting the candidate’s political proximity to the White House. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed since returning to office in January, blasting Powell — whom he appointed as Chair during his first term — as a “numbskull” and a “major loser” for not cutting interest rates more quickly. The Fed withstood the pressure until September, when signs of a slowdown in the labor market emerged. It cut rates again in October, but Powell upset those expecting more easing soon by warning that another cut in December is by no means “a done deal.” Since then, several of his colleagues on the Federal Open Markets Committee have expressed reluctance to cut any further in December, pointing to an inflation rate stuck above the 2 percent target. Usually, when the labor market weakens, so does inflation, but that hasn’t happened this time. At both of his last two press conferences, Powell noted that the Fed’s dual mandate of keeping prices stable while pursuing full employment were currently “in tension” with each other. Hassett has presented a very different view, telling CNBC in November that “inflation has come way down” from the 5 percent that it averaged during Joe Biden’s presidency andthat “the trajectory is really, really, really good if you look at it.” That’s despite U.S. headline inflation actually rising in four of the last five months. That is why many in Frankfurt see alternative candidates — including the dovish but experienced Fed Governor Christopher Waller — as far safer choices. Also still in the running, according to various sources, are former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock fixed-income chief Rick Rieder, and sitting Governor Michelle Bowman. For decades, relations between the Fed and the ECB have been collegial and cooperative. Members of the small, globally connected circle of central bankers have long seen themselves as a kind of fraternity. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, then-ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet liked to emphasize that closeness by repeatedly referring to Fed Chair Ben Bernanke as “my good friend Ben.” More recently, as Powell has come under fire from the White House, European colleagues have rushed to defend him. Lagarde told a Washington Post event in April that “I have … enormous respect for Chair Powell, and I know that he’s doing exactly what’s expected of him to serve the American people.” Deutsche Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel echoed such comments more recently. Outside the eurozone, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey — another central banker anxious about the risk of financial volatility — called Powell “a man of the utmost integrity.” With Powell’s departure looming, ECB officials increasingly fear that this long-standing, trust-based relationship may be nearing its end, a fourth official told POLITICO. These concerns have already begun to influence the ECB’s strategic considerations in other areas, including liquidity policies and its own leadership succession. The ECB declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Ben Munster) The attractiveness of alternative backstops is rising in a financial system that may be losing its anchor. Central bank president delivers a rueful “told you so” But Germany may also want a say in the race to replace Christine Lagarde. Tentative signs of a stable recovery will allow for a stable rate policy, Austria’s new central banker tells POLITICO.

Title: Ripple CEO Predicts 2026 Will Be A Breakout Year For Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-2026-breakout-year-for-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-12-05T03:00:27Z
Full Content:
At Binance Blockchain Week on December 3, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued that a rare alignment of regulatory change, institutional demand and real-world utility is setting up crypto for what he called powerful “macro tailwinds” heading into 2026. “I personally will echo some of the things Richard said: there are so many macro factors that are continuing to provide tailwinds for this industry that I think as we go into 2026 I don’t remember being this optimistic in the last handful of years,” the Ripple CEO told CNBC’s Dan Murphy, speaking alongside Binance CEO Richard Teng and Solana Foundation President Lily Liu. He framed the latest drawdown not as the start of a structural bear market but as a risk-off interlude against a fundamentally improved backdrop. “Crypto has gone through cycles and when you have risk-on people are excited […] now you have kind of a risk-off moment, there’s uncertainty,” he said. The difference this time, he argued, is that the United States—the largest single economy and roughly “22% of global GDP”—is finally moving away from what he described as years of open hostility toward the sector. “This is a market that has been really openly hostile to crypto for four or five years or maybe longer, and now you have that that has changed significantly, pretty quickly,” he said. Institutions, in his view, are only beginning to adjust. He pointed to the visible presence of traditional asset managers at the event: “You saw Franklin Templeton on stage here, you saw BlackRock on stage just this week. I think Vanguard has now opened up […] Vanguard historically has said ‘we won’t touch crypto’ and now they’ve had a massive sea change.” On crypto ETFs, the Ripple CEO rejected the idea that the trade was over-hyped. “Definitely no,” he said when asked whether the ETF “floor” narrative had been exaggerated. He stressed how new these vehicles still are in the United States and highlighted early demand for XRP products. “In the last two or three weeks over $700 million have flowed into XRP ETFs, which is just pent-up demand from institutional investors, from investors who want access because they don’t want to custody themselves,” he said. He argued that the key metric is crypto’s still-small slice of the overall ETF universe. “The total ETF market—only one or two percent of the total ETF market is crypto. I will bet anybody here that a year from now that will be more than one or two percent,” he said. Short-term outflows from Bitcoin products, he suggested, should be viewed in context: “Over 2026 do we really think crypto ETFs are only going to be one or two percent of the total ETF market? No chance.” Garlinghouse said Ripple’s own prime brokerage business is already seeing that shift in behavior. Institutions that had remained “on the sidelines” due to regulatory uncertainty or risk aversion are now “getting involved and they’re starting small, and they’re going to walk, then they’re going to crawl—or crawl then walk then run.” Asked directly whether recent volatility had deterred institutional capital, he replied: “Definitely not.” Stablecoins were another pillar of his 2026 thesis. He agreed that in the latest risk-off phase, capital largely rotated into stablecoins rather than exiting on-chain rails, which he said reflects both utility and trust. “People are recognizing stablecoins can be stable and easier to manage,” he said. Garlinghouse highlighted that Ripple’s own stablecoin, launched “just over a year ago,” has “just passed about a billion market cap,” is “approved and whitelisted in Abu Dhabi,” and is being used as “good collateral on various platforms from a lending point of view.” For him, stablecoins are an entry ramp to broader adoption, alongside other applications that will be built across Solana, Binance and Ripple ecosystems. On US policy, he said the trajectory has clearly improved, especially for payment tokens. He cited the GENIUS Act as “regulatory clarity for stablecoins” and linked it to growing corporate interest in on-chain payments. After Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury, which has visibility into “over 10 trillion dollars of payments,” he said “the number of those customers that are already approaching us interested in leveraging stablecoins […] because of that clarity, people are leaning in.” The Ripple CEO noted that XRP has already received a form of clarity from US federal courts but said broader legislation is still needed. He referenced the “Clarity Act” for crypto, saying there is “still forward momentum” and predicting that “sometime in the first half of next year we’ll see passage of legislation, which will continue to unlock and create more tailwinds for the whole industry.” He closed with an explicit price target for the next cycle, acknowledging he was “going out on a limb”: “I’ll say Bitcoin $180,000 December 23rd—or December 31st—2026.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.15.

Title: Crypto bounces as the macro market remains uncertain: Will it sustain?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=551291
Time Published: 2025-12-05T01:00:30Z
Full Content:
A sustained growth in spot demand and OI is necessary to drive the next rally. The crypto market saw a 10.4% bounce in total market capitalization since the swift price drop in the early hours of Monday. Bitcoin [BTC] led the charge, gaining 10.55%. Some altcoins have posted greater returns. The U.S. government reopened on the 13th of November, after a 43-day pause. This threw a monkey wrench into the machinery, as the market was missing some key information. Some reports were being released. For example, on Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said that private employers shed 32,000 jobs in November. In contrast, economists expected an increase of 40,000 jobs. On the bright side, the Federal Reserve officially ended its quantitative tightening (QT). The stock market also had a positive performance on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 up 0.3% for the day. The Bank of America and BlackRock asserted that the AI boom was driven by real corporate investment, and not irrational exuberance that drove the dot-com bubble. The current environment was described as more of an “air pocket” than a bubble by Bank of America’s head of equity and research. These developments showed that the already volatile crypto-sphere was being tugged at in different directions by the indecisive macro conditions as well. Source: TOTAL on TradingView The total crypto market cap fell below $3.56 trillion, a key support level, in September. It continued to trend downward, but something interesting happened over the past two weeks. The trendline support (yellow) from November 2023 was breached in November. The retest of the same level as resistance, surprisingly, did not reject the total market cap. It served as support once again in recent days. Perhaps the crypto bounce could continue in the coming weeks. Source: CoinGlass The Open Interest behind Bitcoin has slowly grown over the past three days, but it was still shallow compared to the October highs. A lack of speculative interest showed that market confidence was still low, and bullish bets were not as big as earlier. A sustained growth in spot demand and OI is necessary to drive the next rally. Until then, investors and traders can treat the bounce as a bounce and not expect a full recovery.

NEXT | The Queue: As yet I have found no werewolves Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. This one isn’t included in the Early Access, so we’ll have to wait for Midnight’s launch to obtain it. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. This one is also absent from the Early Access period, so put it on your list for Midnight’s launch week. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Originally published November 27, 2025.

Title: Canton Network Creator Snags Strategic Investment from Wall Street Giants

Time Published: 2025-12-04T21:12:22Z

Digital Asset, the blockchain firm behind the Canton Network (CC), said Thursday that it has secured strategic investments from four major traditional financial players, as Wall Street's crypto embrace continues. The investors in this round were BNY, a financial services firm overseeing $57 trillion in client assets, exchange operator Nasdaq, financial intelligence firm S&P Global and iCapital, a fintech firm backed by BlackRock, Blackstone and JP Morgan. The company did not disclose the size of the investment in the press release. The investment underscores the growing support of legacy financial firms for blockchain infrastructure built specifically for regulated markets. The Canton Network was designed to enable institutions to issue and trade tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds, loans, and funds, on a shared ledger while maintaining privacy and compliance with legal requirements. It combines features of public blockchains, such as decentralization, with the safeguards required by traditional finance. “Institutions across the financial ecosystem recognize the necessity of blockchain infrastructure purpose-built for regulated markets," Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset, said in a statement. " The latest investment comes on the heels of Digital Asset's $135 million funding round in June, which was led by major firms including BNP Paribas, TradeWeb, Goldman Sachs, DRW, and Citadel Securities. Canton currently boasts $6 trillion of assets onchain with over 600 institutions participating across the ecosystem, the firm said.

Deutsche Börse Group (DBG) and Kraken announced on Thursday that they are combining forces, signaling a clear acceleration of institutional cryptocurrency adoption in the Eurozone. “This partnership is the clearest signal yet that institutional adoption is accelerating, and that Europe intends to compete on equal footing with Wall Street as this transformation moves from millions to billions,” Gurpreet Oberoi, Kraken Head of Institutional, told Coindesk. “Institutions across Europe aren’t just experimenting with digital assets anymore, they’re building real strategies, and they need infrastructure that matches the scale of their ambitions,” Oberoi added, noting that the partnership is "powerful validation of that shift." By combining Kraken’s proven crypto-native expertise and U.S. market access with the trust and systemic importance of DBG’s regulated derivatives clearing, Eurex, and custody arm, Clearstream, which has more than $23 trillion in assets under custody, are building a comprehensive, full-stack bridge designed to capture institutional flow, the companies said in the press release. Following the Trump Administration’s GENIUS Act, which provided the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins, Wall Street has moved at an unprecedented pace. Corporate giants like BlackRock, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Fidelity have been quick to provide their institutional clients with exposure to crypto. Several of them have issued BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have recently become a top revenue source for some. While Europe isn't far behind, DBG — generally seen as the single largest and most essential financial market infrastructure conglomerate in the Eurozone — is among financial institutions in the region that are working to match their U.S. counterparts. In September, the group signed a memorandum of understanding with Circle Internet Group to bring regulated stablecoins into Europe’s financial market infrastructure. More recently, on Nov. 18, Deutsche Börse Group and Societe Generale-FORGE signed an agreement to bring regulated euro and dollar stablecoins into the systems that support some of Europe’s largest financial markets. The new partnership between DBG and Kraken serves as a structural declaration that Europe's financial core is committed to directly challenging U.S. dominance in the emerging digital capital markets, according to the press release. The race for institutional crypto adoption is underway, but it’s not a recent phenomenon and is not exclusive to Wall Street and Europe either. The institutional acceptance of crypto around the world is accelerating significantly, developing hand in hand with better-defined regulation, BlockFills CEO Nick Hammer said in an interview with CoinDesk.

December 04, 2025 13:21 ET | Source: TZNXG CRYPTO GROUP LTD TZNXG CRYPTO GROUP LTD DENVER, , Dec. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As financial giants like BlackRock enter the space, Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization is emerging as the crypto industry's most significant growth frontier. On the eve of this multi-trillion-dollar market explosion, US-registered digital asset exchange TZNXG today formally unveiled the core of its ecosystem expansion strategy: building a compliant bridge for RWAs. Leveraging its existing US regulatory qualifications and institutional-grade security network, TZNXG is dedicated to removing the barriers for traditional financial assets to enter the Web3 world. Compliance: The Cornerstone of RWA Trust Unlike native crypto assets, bringing real-world assets like bonds, real estate, or equity onto the blockchain requires "compliance" as a prerequisite. TZNXG’s Money Services Business (MSB) registration with the US FinCEN (Registration No: 31000300407129) provides the critical legal framework to support RWA operations. "RWA is not a game of technology, but a game of trust," stated James Anderson, CEO of TZNXG. "By holding authoritative regulatory licenses, TZNXG resolves the compliance concerns of traditional institutions, acting as a 'chartered gateway' for traditional capital to safely enter the digital asset realm." Infrastructure: Securing Assets at Scale To accommodate the large-scale onboarding of real-world assets, TZNXG is deploying bank-grade infrastructure. Aligned with its strategic roadmap, TZNXG has established a deep collaboration with Fireblocks, the world’s largest digital asset custody platform. This alliance is pivotal—through Fireblocks' Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology, TZNXG can provide institutional-grade custody for tokenized treasuries, gold, or corporate credit. This ensures that on-chain asset ownership is both transparent and fortified against top-tier cyber threats, perfectly meeting the stringent security requirements of asset management firms. Ecosystem Vision: From Trading to Financial Interconnection TZNXG’s ambition extends beyond spot trading. According to Phase 4 of the company's whitepaper roadmap, TZNXG is actively working towards a Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Platform. This initiative aims to break liquidity silos, allowing users to seamlessly trade digitized physical assets within the TZNXG ecosystem. Through planned DeFi gateway integrations, future investors will be able to easily invest in traditionally illiquid asset classes (such as real estate equity or private equity) using stablecoins, realizing true financial inclusion. About TZNXG TZNXG is a digital asset exchange platform dedicated to providing a secure, transparent, and compliant trading environment. Registered in Colorado, USA (Entity ID: 20251549843) and holding a US FinCEN MSB registration (No: 31000300407129), TZNXG integrates institutional-grade security measures, including MPC technology and cold storage protocols, serving global investors who demand ultimate security and professional experience.

Title: Sovereign Wealth Funds Were Buyers as Bitcoin Plunged: BlackRock's Larry Fink

Sovereign wealth funds were buying the dip in bitcoin BTC$89,542.53, according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. “We’re seeing more and more legitimate, long-holding investors investing in it,” Fink said Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. “I can tell you there are a number of sovereign funds [...] they are adding incrementally at $120,000, $100,000; I know they bought more in the $80s.” That state actors have been buyers of bitcoin isn't news — Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company and Luxembourg's sovereign wealth fund are among those that have previously disclosed investments in the spot bitcoin ETFs. That SWFs were adding to positions as bitcoin plunged below the $90,000 level in recent weeks is notable though, as Fink continued: “They’re establishing a longer position and then you own it over years ... It’s not a trade, you own it for a purpose.” Fink’s remarks reflect a growing shift in how some of the world’s largest investors are approaching bitcoin. While the asset’s price remains volatile, institutional interest — particularly from sovereign funds managing national wealth — signals confidence in the asset's long-term resilience. Fink, who once dismissed bitcoin, has gradually become one of its most prominent institutional advocates. Under his leadership, BlackRock launched the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has drawn billions in assets since its debut in early 2024 has become the asset manager's most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF). At the DealBook event, Fink again emphasized bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against growing government debt and inflation. “I believe there is a big, large use case for it,” he said, framing the asset less as a vehicle for speculation and more as a way to protect against currency debasement.

Title: $4B Bitcoin ETF Outflows in October-November Reflect Basis Trade Unwind, Not Capitulation: Analyst
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/04/usd4b-bitcoin-etf-outflows-in-oct-nov-reflect-basis-trade-unwind-not-capitulation-research-analyst
Time Published: 2025-12-04T16:28:01Z
Full Content:
The U.S.-listed spot bitcoin BTC$89,542.53 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw billions in outflows in recent weeks amid a 35% price plunge from $125,000 to the low $80,000s, sparking talk of institutional capitulation. Yet data analysis by Amberdata presents a far more nuanced picture: concentrated redemptions from "basis trade," or arbitrage bets closures, not broad panic across ETFs, with total holdings staying robust at 1.43 million BTC. "Nearly $4 billion in Bitcoin ETF outflows since mid-October. Price collapsed from $125,000 to the low $80,000s - a 35% drawdown that erased six months of gains. The prevailing interpretation: institutions had arrived, seen enough, and were leaving," Michael Marshall, head of research at Amberdata, said in a report. "The selling, however, was highly concentrated among a few issuers and tied to a mechanical basis trade unwind, not broad investor fear," Marshall added. Capitulation in financial markets occurs when sellers exhaust themselves after prolonged declines, typically marked by panic selling, high volume, and extreme fear indicators. In the ETF context, true capitulation would entail broad selling across issuers and massive redemptions. But that wasn't the case over the past two months. Marshall noted that BlackRock dominated 97%-99% of more recent weekly outflows despite holding only 48-51% of assets under management while Fidelity FBTC registered inflows and other smaller ETFs held steady. Meanwhile, over the full 53-day window from Oct. 1 to Nov. 26, Grayscale bled $923 million, which is 53.2% of total gross outflows, followed by 21Shares and Grayscale Mini. Together, these three accounted for 89.1% of outflows. By contrast, BlackRock and Fidelity registered inflows. This dual framing underscores the point: no widespread capitulation, but targeted unwinds. The day-to-day fluctuations in ETF fund flows were highly variable, with a standard deviation of $372 million compared to an average daily flow of $27 million. The culprit? Collapsing basis spreads in the spot-futures arbitrage trade, also known as the basis trade, where funds bought ETF shares and sold futures to capture contango yield—direction-neutral, not a BTC price view. The annualized 30-day basis, or the spread between futures and spot prices, compressed 217 basis points from 6.63% to 4.46%, with 93% of recent days below the 5% breakeven threshold, according to Marshall. This forced carry traders to unwind – sell spot and buy back futures. The decline in perpetual futures open interest alongside ETF outflows is evidence of that. Per data tracked by Marshall, BTC perpetual open interest plunged 37.7% ($4.23 billion peak-to-trough), "correlating 0.878 with basis moves", near-lockstep evidence of simultaneous ETF sales and futures short covers. With basis traders shaken out, the remaining ETF ownership represents sticky institutional capital betting on long-term price appreciation. In other words, the market is much cleaner and reset for a bigger rally. "With the arbitrage overhang cleared, remaining flows increasingly reflect genuine allocation rather than yield harvesting. The market that emerges is less leveraged, more conviction-driven, and structurally cleaner than the one that entered October," Marshall said.

Title: BlackRock Warns on US Debt While Bitcoin Hyper Presale Accelerates

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Surging US debt and sticky deficits are no longer a quiet background issue. They are starting to feel like the entire plot. BlackRock’s recent AI-driven research makes it clear: nonstop Treasury issuance and rising interest costs put pressure on long-term bonds. When the concept of a risk-free asset starts wobbling, investors begin asking the classic question: where do we turn next? Bitcoin keeps showing up in those conversations. After the spot ETF wave, $BTC turned into a boardroom-friendly hedge. If US debt continues to climb, a supply-capped and rules-based asset starts looking pretty good. That is the broad idea BlackRock is pointing toward. But once institutions agree Bitcoin belongs in the hedge bucket, the next question hits fast: how do you actually use $BTC inside today’s high-speed markets? On-chain Bitcoin is slow, block space is tight, and fees can spike into tens of dollars when the network gets busy. Great for cold storage. Not great for anything that needs to move quickly. It markets itself as a high-performance Bitcoin Layer 2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), offering sub-second settlement and smart contracts while anchoring its security to Bitcoin. If BlackRock’s macro outlook drives more capital into $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper aims to be the platform where that capital actually generates results. Think payments, DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and more. If the U.S. is heading toward chronic deficits, higher rates, and nonstop Treasury issuance, then long-duration bonds stop looking like a safe parking spot and start acting like a stress test. That is why large asset managers talk about needing new hedges. Bitcoin fits that role, as do gold and tokenized assets backed by real collateral. As institutions add Bitcoin exposure, the pressure builds to make $BTC usable, not just something you lock in a vault. Ethereum rollups and Solana solve those problems, but they are not secured by Bitcoin, which matters to investors who want their hedge and their infrastructure to be based on the same monetary foundation. That is why the race among Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2s and sidechains is speeding up. Stacks, Rootstock, and others are trying to push programmability closer to Bitcoin, each making different trade-offs. Bitcoin Hyper is one of the new crypto projects taking a more ambitious approach: instead of building a new system, it uses the Solana VM and anchors it to Bitcoin. It is like taking a sports car engine and dropping it into a truck known for reliability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) focuses heavily on speed. The design is modular: Bitcoin Layer 1 handles settlement and data availability, while an SVM-powered Layer 2 handles execution. Developers can use Rust and Solana-style tools, but the chain ultimately settles back to $BTC instead of $SOL. The goal is simple: push beyond Solana speeds while inheriting Bitcoin’s trust and brand power. Bitcoin Hyper currently relies on a single trusted sequencer. It batches transactions and anchors its state to the Bitcoin blockchain. Fees aim to stay at fractions of a cent, not the usual on-chain $BTC spikes. A decentralized canonical bridge moves $BTC into wrapped assets for fast swaps, payments, lending, and staking. The presale is already large. Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $28.9M and you can buy $HYPER now for just $0.013375. For Bitcoin holders and DeFi users, the pitch is straightforward. If institutional money continues to flow into $BTC due to macroeconomic risks, the next stage of the trade may manifest in the infrastructure that makes Bitcoin actually useful. Bitcoin Hyper wants to be that high-throughput SVM Layer 2 built for payments, gaming, and composable DeFi. Join the $HYPER presale now.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink reveals sovereign wealth funds are buying Bitcoin for the long term

Share this article Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, revealed that sovereign wealth funds are incrementally buying Bitcoin at various price levels, building long-term positions rather than trading for short-term gains. “They’re adding incrementally at 120, 100. I know they bought more in the 80s,” said Fink during a panel discussion at The New York Times DealBook Summit. “They’re establishing a longer position, and you own it over years. This is not a trade. You own it for a purpose.” Fink has evolved from a Bitcoin skeptic to recognizing it as a potential portfolio asset, aligning with BlackRock’s leadership in crypto-related products. The firm has recently expanded into crypto investments and asset tokenization. Recent reports indicate that sovereign wealth funds are quietly building strategic Bitcoin reserves, boosting their positions even as prices fluctuate. The funds view the digital asset as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Wall Street scrambles for piece of 'Trump accounts' for kids

Pedestrians walk by the Charging Bull at the Wall Street on September 26, 2025 in New York City. (Zhang Weiguo/VCG via Getty Images) Major banks and brokerages on Wall Street are dashing to come out as the big winner and handle the so-called "Trump accounts" for kids. The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday that financial firms want a stake in the nascent program, which is designed to provide $1,000 in federal cash to children born during President Donald Trump's second term. The initiative received a big boost this week from Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan, when the pair announced a $6.25 billion donation towards the program, seeding 25 million accounts with $250 each. Some of the early contenders reportedly include JP Morgan Chase; Charles Schwab and Robinhood, both brokerages; and money managing firms like Blackrock. The financial institutions are expected to provide their pitch to become the Treasury Department's "designated financial agent" in charge of the accounts. “We have given the president and Treasury our assurances that Robinhood can dedicate the technology and capital to making these accounts as robust and intuitive as possible,” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a statement provided to the Journal. For the Wall Street firm that comes out on top, the accounts present an enormous opportunity to cultivate new customers once they reach adulthood. Given the government-backed nature of the program, the management fees are likely to be lower. The Trump administration is expected to launch a sign-up portal sometime early next year. For now, it's finalizing a new IRS form that will enable parents to apply for the account. Venture capitalist Brad Gerstner, an architect of the program, said on Tuesday that U.S. companies are expressing interest in matching their workers' contributions. He listed chipmaking giant Nvidia, the ride-hail company Uber, and the wireless tech company T-Mobile among them.

According to BlackRock's 2026 Global Outlook, Pushing Limits, Indian equities have lagged global and emerging market peers this year amid some signs of moderating growth, renewed geopolitical frictions with the US and foreign flows rotating toward markets more directly linked to the AI theme, such as South Korea and Taiwan. Domestic derivatives activity also cooled after SEBI’s regulatory tightening. This follows a strong multi-year run: Indian equities have returned nearly 80 per cent in US dollar terms over five years, ahead of global equities and broader emerging markets. India’s forward price-to-earnings ratio remains above emerging markets averages, but is supported by India’s stronger nominal growth outlook, it said. “We estimate India’s equity risk premium, our preferred valuation gauge since it considers both earnings growth expectations and prevailing interest rates, to be about 4.3 per cent, close to its long-term average,” said the report. Indian equities constitute roughly 1.7 per cent of the MSCI ACWI index, even as the economy accounts for about 7 per cent of global GDP. India’s improving macro stability and credit quality offer income and diversification at a time when developed market bonds provide less ballast, it said. Ben Powell, Chief Middle East and APAC Investment Strategist, BlackRock Investment Institute, said, Unlike the 1990s tech bubble, leading AI-linked companies are making a huge amount of money and consistently surprising markets with robust revenues, cash flow and earnings. “These are real companies making amazing amounts of money. We can debate valuation for sure, but there’s definitely something here,” he said. Powell added that the momentum story behind AI remains intact, with BlackRock expecting earnings strength to continue into 2026. While US mega tech stocks remain central to the theme, the opportunities are now broader and more global, he added. However, he said the AI buildout in the US faces many constraints involving compute and energy, with energy the most binding now. AI data centres could use 15-20 per cent of current US electricity demand by 2030 – a scale sure to test the limits of power grid, fossil and materials industries. BlackRock has a bearish view on long-term US Treasuries, warning that a coming wave of AI-related financing could put upward pressure on US borrowing costs and exacerbate worries over US government indebtedness.

Today’s top news: The world’s largest asset manager is betting big on equities into 2026. Thanks to AI and the digital asset boom. BlackRock released its 2026 Global Outlook yesterday, and the message is straightforward: they’re staying risk-on. The firm is overweight equities, underweight long-term Treasuries, and doubling down on what it calls the “mega forces” driving markets for the next decade. Specifically, they see AI, the digital-finance buildout, and major shifts in global supply chains and geopolitics as driving factors. Here are the core takeaways from the report: Not the advice many would’ve expected, even a few years ago. “We remain pro-risk and see the AI theme still the main driver of U.S. equities. Yet this environment is ripe for active investing – picking winners and losers from among the builders now and later as AI gains start to spread, in our view.” - BlackRock 2026 Global Outlook report “Stablecoins are no longer niche–they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” BlackRock’s Global Head of Market Development Samara Cohen said. Essentially, BlackRock is betting on growth, innovation, and long-term risk assets. Not on a cookie-cutter, ancient 60/40 playbook of bond and equity index diversification. And crypto (stablecoins) has a seat at the table. This matters because when the biggest capital allocator in the world is leaning into equities and structural growth themes and sectors, it pushes capital in that direction. Investment managers don’t get fired tailing BlackRock. The biggest takeaway for crypto is that digital assets and digital finance are now officially a “mega force,” to steal BlackRock’s term. BlackRock explicitly frames stablecoins, tokenization, and digital-asset infrastructure as part of the long-run transformation they’re positioning around. That’s significant validation from a financial giant, that crypto is both investable and here to stay. Major forces are shaping the future, and crypto (stablecoins) are one of the forces alongside AI and geopolitics.

Title: TAO surges past $300 ahead of first halving, fueling bullish outlook for Bittensor
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/tao-surges-past-300-ahead-of-first-halving-fueling-bullish-outlook-for-bittensor/
Time Published: 2025-12-04T13:09:05Z
Full Content:
Bittensor (TAO) traded green on the day on December 4, 2025, with sentiment bullish as the altcoin breached the $300 threshold. This surge, occurring just days before the network’s historic halving event, could allow bulls to target recent highs. Growing confidence in Bittensor’s role as a pioneering platform in decentralized AI and in machine learning incentives has TAO as one of the altcoins traders are watching. The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a notable uptick in the past 24 hours. While bears continue to maraud amid potential profit-taking spikes, bulls are showing strength. A flurry of activity surrounding Bittensor, a blockchain protocol that decentralizes AI model training and inference through a competitive subnet ecosystem, points to TAO price’s likely short term rally. In this case, TAO’s surge above $300 represents a pivotal moment. The altcoin surged to above $314 on Dec. 4 before paring some of the gains. Significantly, Bittensor price dramatically jumped from around $300 on October 11, 2025, to hit $500 on November 2. The rally in a little over three weeks nonetheless fizzled, and the TAO price is down about 28% in the past month. The token’s correction came amid broader market jitters. Bittensor is a top AI-related coin by market cap, ahead of NEAR Protocol, Internet Computer, and RENDER. Growth has included the project’s positioning as the marketplace for machine intelligence. It’s where validators and miners earn TAO rewards for contributing computational resources and novel AI models. Prices have often spiked amid key AI developments, and that reflects amid latest outlook. Wall Street giants point out that the AI boom that catapulted Nvidia and other stocks higher is not a bubble. Noting that the sector could yet explode, BlackRock and Bank of America analysts have forecast a fresh supercycle. Key drivers of this include real corporate investments, major earnings, and productivity gains. AI is not driven by the irrational exuberance that underpinned the dot-com bubble in the 2000s, the analysts noted. The TAO price could rally amid the anticipated AI narrative resurgence. Bittensor’s inaugural halving, which is about 10 days away as of writing, is about network tokenomics. It mirrors Bitcoin’s supply-reduction strategy, but tailored to AI incentives. Currently, the network emits approximately 7,200 TAO tokens daily to reward participants in its proof-of-intelligence consensus. However, the halving will cut the emissions to 3,600 TAO. Bittensor has a total supply of 21 million TAO, and the halving, like in BTC’s case, ensures long-term scarcity as adoption grows. The halving could thus catalyze price discovery. BTC jumped following its 2024 halving, and TAO bulls are likely to eye a return to $500. Notably, the coin’s all-time high of $795.6 was reached in April 2024.

Title: Michael Saylor’s Strategy may have BlackRock to thank for the 11% rise in Bitcoin

Time Published: 2025-12-04T12:17:01Z

Bitcoin is holding at just above $93,000 per coin this morning after staging a nearly 11% rally since its low on Nov. 22 of just above $84,000. Its recovery seems to have rescued Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the Bitcoin treasury company whose stock rose 3.9% yesterday and is up 8.4% over the past five sessions. It was up marginally this morning in overnight trading.Although Strategy’s market cap ($55.7 billion) remains below the value of the $60.6 billion in Bitcoin it owns, its mNAV ratio (net asset value expressed as enterprise value over its Bitcoin holdings) has risen to 1.16 this morning. If Strategy’s mNAV falls below one, owning the stock becomes a money-losing prospect, and the company said it may be theoretically forced into selling part of its Bitcoin hoard. Saylor may have BlackRock and its retail investors to thank for helping it avoid that crisis. In Q4 2025 so far, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) continued to add Bitcoin while most of the other ETFs sold off. “BlackRock, which, despite heavy outflows of roughly 23,226 BTC between Nov. 1 and Dec. 1, has still added a net 24,411 BTC compared with the previous quarter,” analyst Paul Hoffman wrote in a research note for BestBrokers.com, a site that ranks trading platforms. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now owns just under 60% of all Bitcoins owned by ETFs, he said, bringing its total to 776,474.65 coins as of Dec. 1. Its Q4 buying was preceded by the acquisition of another 71,236 coins in Q3, Hoffman wrote. That means BlackRock’s ETF, which retail investors use to buy Bitcoin without actually owning their own crypto wallet, now owns 3.9% of all existing Bitcoin—more than Strategy. BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune. IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product, according to CoinDesk. Perhaps unsurprisingly, BlackRock chief Larry Fink is now fairly bullish on Bitcoin. Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Wednesday, he admitted he once thought Bitcoin was for money laundering and thieves. Since then, “my thought process has evolved,” he said. “I see a big, large use case for Bitcoin, and I still do today,” he said. “In my role, I see thousands of clients a year. I meet with governmental leaders, and we have conversations that evolve my thinking. This is a very public example of a big shift in my opinion.” Also helping: news that Vanguard, which has long turned its nose up at crypto, will cave and offer its massive customer base another Bitcoin ETF. Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

Title: Bitcoin Is ‘An Asset Of Fear,’ Says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink

Time Published: 2025-12-04T12:00:43Z
Full Content:
BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink has framed Bitcoin’s latest boom-and-bust swing as the clearest expression yet of its core narrative: not a growth asset, but “an asset of fear.” Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook “Crypto and Capital” event alongside Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Fink contrasted the $13.5 trillion BlackRock manages with the motivations behind Bitcoin demand. BlackRock’s portfolios, he said, are essentially “managing hope” over decades: “The $13.5 trillion that BlackRock managed on behalf of our clients, it’s basically managing hope. That’s all it is. I mean, why would anybody invest in a 30-year outcome unless you’re hopeful that in 30 years you’re going to have the compounding effect.” Bitcoin, by contrast, he placed on the opposite side of the psychological ledger. “Bitcoin is an asset of fear,” Fink said. “You own Bitcoin because you’re frightened of your physical security. You own it because you’re frightened of your financial security. The long-term fundamental reason you own it [is] because of debasement of financial assets because of deficits.” His comments came against the backdrop of a sharp reversal in the Bitcoin market. The asset hit an all-time high above $125,000 in early October 2025 before sliding nearly 30% and briefly dropping below $90,000 in mid-November. Fink explicitly referenced that move to illustrate just how violent the swings can be. “If you had bought it at $125,000 and it’s now sitting at $90,000,” he said, anyone treating it as a trade is dealing with “a very volatile asset” and “you’re going to have to be really good at market timing, which most people aren’t.” For investors using Bitcoin as a macro hedge, he argued, the volatility looks different. “If you’re buying it as a hedge against all your hope, you know, then it has a meaningful impact on a portfolio.” In his telling, Bitcoin rallies when fear rises and retreats when fear subsides, citing episodes such as a US–China trade agreement or talk of a possible Ukraine settlement, after which Bitcoin “fell a little bit.” The pattern, he suggested, is consistent with a fear-driven hedge against geopolitical risk and fiscal slippage. Fink also underscored that structurally, the market remains fragile. “The other big problem of Bitcoin is it is still heavily influenced by leveraged players,” he said, linking the asset’s outsized volatility to leverage even as flows through his firm’s spot ETF channel normalize. Since launching IBIT, BlackRock has already lived through several drawdowns on the order of 20–25%, he noted, yet the holder base is shifting. “We’re seeing more and more legitimate long-only investors investing in it,” he said, citing a large foundation endowment and adding that “a number of sovereign funds” are “adding incrementally at $120k, at $100k,” and “bought more in the $80k’s.” For those allocators, he stressed, “this is not a trade. You own it over years. This is not a trade. You own it for a purpose.” The stance marks a striking reversal from Fink’s 2017 description of Bitcoin as an “index for money laundering… and thieves.” He told the audience that during the pandemic he “took it upon myself to visit and talk to a lot of people who were advocates of it,” asking, “What am I missing?” and that “around 2021–22” he began to “evolve those views.” It is, he conceded, “a very glaring public example of a big shift in my opinion,” adding, “I have very strong views but that doesn’t mean I’m not wrong.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,107.

Title: CEOs are making the business case for AI—and dispelling talk of a bubble

Good morning. I spent yesterday hearing from dozens of business leaders onstage and off at the New York Times DealBook Summit, deftly moderated by Andrew Ross Sorkin. I was invited to moderate a thought-provoking breakfast conversation on the topic of mission as a driver of growth, with Vanguard President and Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis, Nike Chief Communications Officer Michael Gonda and author Simon Sinek. The takeaway for me: If leaders don’t internalize and institutionalize a company’s mission, it’s just rhetoric. With that in mind, a few themes emerged for me: Acceptance of a new normal. Opinions may change—fast. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed his earlier concerns about President Trump’s “maximalist” approach to trade wars, and inflation in blue states, saying his thinking on tariffs “had evolved.” But hearing Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong talk about a “golden age” in one of the worst weeks for crypto or GM CEO Mary Barra shrug off 180-degree policy shifts makes you realize that we’ve gotten used to it. With the notable exception of California Governor Gavin Newsom, nobody had a negative word to say about Trump, tariffs or much of what’s happening on the federal policy front. “It’s amazing what feels normalized,” one foreign business leader told me. The need for leaders to build trust. PR guru Richard Edelman told me to stay tuned for some daunting data on the mass-class divide in the upcoming Edelman Trust Barometer. A finance CEO pointed to a row of bodyguards, reminding me that Dec. 4 is the anniversary of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson being shot to death a few blocks away, with his alleged murderer in a downtown courthouse as we spoke. On stage, Alex Karp of Palantir said leaders are losing credibility because they fail to give real opinions or face consequences for “completely stupid decisions.” He added that dyslexia made him learn to think freely, he creates friction by blowing things up, and believes being authentically transparent to the point of rude has paid dividends with employees who know he’s going to tell the truth about products and the rest of the business, too. Not speaking up means you’re “underestimating your audience,” he said, and likely to lose access to smart people who’ll work elsewhere. Stop talking about AI bubbles. Asset prices may be high and some investment dollars may be dumb, but the business case for AI is compelling. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked about revenue rising much faster than headcount. At my table conversation led by AOL cofounder and startup investor Steve Case, we talked about the opportunities to scale innovation and even spawn one-person unicorns. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made a compelling case that policymakers and leaders have to contend with the job loss and societal shift. But the benefits are clear. As attendee and noted CEO coach Marc Feigen told me: “The only bubble may be all this talk about AI bubbles.” Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump rolls back car efficiency standards U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday weakened Biden-era fuel efficiency standards for new cars and light trucks that had sought to address climate change by encouraging Americans to buy electric vehicles. Flanked by auto industry executives, Trump called the standards a “scam” that were costing Americans too much money. Trump’s tariffs are expected to increase the cost of cars built overseas. Stocks rally on job news Bad news for workers was good news for stocks on Wednesday. Payrolls processor ADP reported that private payrolls shrank by 32,000 in November; economists had expected a 40,000 increase. Investors interpreted the surprise decline as more proof that the Fed will cut interest rates next month, with major indices ending the day up. The most billionaires ever The world now has 2,900 billionaires, up from 2,700 last year, who control $15.8 trillion, according to a new study by UBS. Soaring tech valuations and a robust stock market are minting billionaires at a near-record rate. More child deaths The number of child deaths in 2025 is expected to rise for the first time in decades, according to the Gates Foundation. Many of the additional deaths—estimated at 243,000—have or will occur in countries like Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and Uganda that are plagued by conflict and fragile health systems. Bill Gates attributed the rise in deaths to the 27% drop in global health aid from wealthy countries, including the U.S. IBM CEO’s AI doubts IBM CEO Arvind Krishna doubts that hyperscalers like Google and Amazon will be able to turn a profit at the rate of their AI data center spending. “It’s my view that there’s no way you’re going to get a return on that, because $8 trillion of capex [capital expenditure] means you need roughly $800 billion of profit just to pay for the interest,” he said. Billionaire Michael Saylor stares down potential $8 billion collapse Billionaire Michael Saylor is in a rough spot as the crypto market continues to prove bearish and Strategy, his firm, appears likely to be delisted from a group of popular indexes. If Strategy moves to sell some of its 650,000 bitcoin, which Saylor and Strategy’s CEO have indicated the company is willing to do, Strategy could be the first crypto domino to fall. BofA predicts ‘air pocket,’ not bubble, in AI Savita Subramanian, Bank of America’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, wrote this week that an AI bubble is unlikely. Instead, she predicted that an “air pocket” is forming as companies spend aggressively on data centers, often relying on debt. Companies turn to soup wars for AI talent In a conversation with tech podcaster Ashlee Vance, OpenAI Chief Research Officer Mark Chen described that the company’s war for talent with Meta now includes delivering soup to recruits. Meta’s offerings are “hand-cooked” by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, while OpenAI orders soup from a fancy Korean restaurant. S&P 500 futures are flat this morning. The last session closed up 0.3%. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.3% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.14% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 2.33%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.34%. The South Korea KOSPI was down 0.19%. India’s NIFTY 50 is up 0.18%. Bitcoin was flat at $93K. The wealthy 1% are turning to new status symbols that can’t be bought—and it’s hurting Dior, Versace, and Burberry by Emma Burleigh Alex Karp credits his dyslexia for Palantir’s $415 billion success: ‘There is no playbook a dyslexic can master … therefore we learn to think freely’ by Lily Mae Lazarus Scott Bessent calls the Giving Pledge well-intentioned but ‘very amorphous,’ growing from ‘a panic among the billionaire class’ by Nick Lichtenberg Scott Galloway got mostly B’s and C’s in high school, never studied for the SAT, and had to try twice to get into UCLA.

Check out our Live Bitcoin Updates for December 4, 2025! In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and only a month ago, it hit an ATH of $126K, a 641% in six years and 629,900% in 14 years. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. Arthur Hayes just predicted $BTC to hit $200K by the end of 2025, and Saylor is doubling down on Bitcoin despite the crypto’s slump to under $85K. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack! December 4, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Analysts now argue that a genuine 2026 altcoin season only happens if non-Bitcoin crypto ETFs attract more than $1B in weekly inflows and reach at least $50B in assets by Q4 2026, all while monthly token unlocks stay below $5B. If those conditions fail, altcoin dominance could sink below 10%, leaving $BTC and $ETH as the main institutional plays. In other words, your classic alt season bet depends on a tight alignment between ETF design, unlock schedules, and market sentiment. An alternative is to position where both outcomes still benefit you: Bitcoin-centric infra that also hosts alt-style growth. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) does exactly that. As a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, it lets you bridge $BTC into a high-performance environment where new DeFi, gaming, and NFT protocols can launch while anchored to Bitcoin’s liquidity. If altcoin ETFs boom, more activity flows into that ecosystem; if they lag and $BTC dominates, the demand to scale Bitcoin’s rails only grows. With $28.95M already raised at $0.013375, you get exposure to both paths in a single play. Here’s what Bitcoin Hyper is planning in 2026. December 4, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Taiwan is preparing a Virtual Assets Service Act modeled on MiCA, with a domestic stablecoin (pegged either to the Taiwan dollar or the U.S. dollar) targeted for the second half of 2026 and initially restricted to regulated issuers. Regulators are also assessing how much $BTC has been confiscated and debating whether to add Bitcoin to national reserves as a macro hedge, a move that echoes similar actions in other jurisdictions. That combination shows how sovereigns now treat stablecoins as payment infrastructure and Bitcoin as a strategic store of value. If more countries follow this path, cross-border flows, reserve strategies, and stablecoin rails will increasingly orbit $BTC. You benefit most by owning infra that can host that demand without clogging the base chain. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is built exactly for that: a Bitcoin Layer-2 leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine and a canonical bridge so you can move $BTC into a fast, dApp-ready environment while keeping Bitcoin at the core. With $28.95M raised at a presale price of $0.013375, you front-run that policy-driven usage curve. Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction for 2026. December 4, 2025 • 13:00 UTC $XRP just bounced to around $2.17 after briefly dipping below $2, while analysts map a path either toward $3 or back down near $1.2 depending on how the $2 and $2.3 levels hold. More than $824M has already flowed into the new U.S. spot $XRP ETF, with a single-day peak inflow above $243M, so institutions are clearly active. Yet your outcome still hinges on a few key horizontal lines and the next Bitcoin-driven risk spike. Read more here. If you want exposure to that broader meme and ETF energy without living only on support levels, infrastructure-style meme plays can offer a different angle. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as a ‘meme coin mining’ token, using a dedicated mining narrative and integrations with the wider $PEPE ecosystem to reward long-term participation instead of just short-term trading. That structure lets you ride Bitcoin-led risk-on phases while stacking a meme narrative that is not locked to one ETF approval. With $2.26M raised so far and a token price of $0.0011778, you enter before mining-focused meme exposure becomes crowded. Buy $PEPENODE now before the altcoin season. December 4, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy, the biggest corporate $BTC holder, has slashed monthly Bitcoin buys from 134,000 $BTC at the 2024 peak to 9,100 $BTC in November 2025, with just 135 $BTC added so far this month. At the same time, it built a $1.4B cash reserve to cover 12–24 months of debt and dividend costs, preparing for a drawn-out bear market rather than racing to accumulate every coin. That signals a shift: less reflexive treasury buying, more focus on sustainable usage and infrastructure. For you, that means the clean ‘corporates stack infinite $BTC’ narrative becomes less dominant, while infra that keeps Bitcoin usable at scale gains relative appeal. Read more here. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed for that outcome. It is the first Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, using a canonical bridge to With $28.95M raised and a token price of $0.013375, you tilt from owning passive reserves toward owning active Bitcoin utility. Here’s how to buy $HYPER now. December 4, 2025 • 11:00 UTC The SEC’s short-selling disclosure rule, 13f-2, has just been kicked another two years down the road, and the new chair openly calls for a ‘reset’ on heavy-handed disclosure. Legal analysts read this as repeal-by-extension, not a simple delay, and see it as a broader retreat from the Gensler-era clampdown on markets, including crypto-exposed stocks and proxies tied to $BTC. That softening stance tends to bring risk appetite back because big funds can run aggressive books without constant new reporting friction. Read more. In that environment, high-beta meme exposure becomes more interesting as a complement to plain $BTC. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans hard into meme culture while actually shipping features: an ERC-20 design, live staking, and degen-style leveraged trading hooks rather than just vibes. Audits from Coinsult and SolidProof add a basic security layer, which matters when leverage and memes collide. With $4.26M raised at a token price of $0.0002715, you are effectively targeting a more explosive expression of a friendlier Bitcoin regulatory mood. Read our Maxi Doge price prediction for upside potential. December 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin has bounced from $84K to around $93K in a 7% move while analysts map a path toward $120K, as long as the five-day streak of $58.5M in daily spot Bitcoin ETF inflows holds. BlackRock’s IBIT alone added $120.1M in one day, which shows that the marginal buyer is now an ETF, not a degen on leverage. Read more here. That kind of regulated demand keeps $BTC structurally bid and pushes more value onto the base chain over time. As more volume and capital move through Bitcoin, blockspace and fees trend higher, and the trade shifts from hoarding coins to owning the rails that keep the network usable. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is that rails play. It is a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, using a canonical bridge so you can move $BTC into an environment with fast execution and Solana-style dApp support while still anchored to Bitcoin’s brand and security. Explore Bitcoin Hyper’s presale in our guide. December 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock’s latest outlook stays risk-on and leans into ‘mega forces’ like AI, tokenization, and stablecoins, arguing these trends will reshape markets over the next decade rather than just fuel a short-term pump. With $BTC trading near $93K and stablecoins at a multi-hundred-billion-dollar market cap, capital clearly prefers programmable rails over legacy intermediaries. That backdrop rewards projects where real economic activity, not just speculation, settles on-chain. Read the full story here. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) fits that lane by turning the $85B creator economy into an on-chain, AI-powered subscription stack. The platform uses an ERC-20 token to handle subscriptions, tipping, and staking, while AI tools automate fan engagement and content flows, so value accrues to creators and holders instead of Web2 middlemen. With $1.38M already raised at a presale price of $0.0571, you step into an early-stage play that sits exactly where BlackRock expects structural growth: AI, payments, and Bitcoin-adjacent on-chain liquidity. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD now. Authored by Bogdan Patru, Bitcoinist — https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-live-news-today-december-4-2025 For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as BlackRock Moves Into AI and Stablecoins

Time Published: 2025-12-04T09:44:10Z

Quick Facts: BlackRock isn’t just talking about ‘mega forces’ anymore – it’s positioning around them. In its recent 2026 Global Outlook, the world’s largest asset manager has highlighted AI, digital infrastructure, and the rapid growth of stablecoins as structural trends reshaping capital markets through 2030 and beyond. The company states that it still prefers AI for 2026 because: We see the AI theme supported by strong earnings, resilient profit margins and healthy balance sheets at large listed tech companies. Continued Fed easing into 2026 and reduced policy uncertainty underpin our overweight to U.S. equities. —BlackRock, 2026 Global Outlook So, utility. That’s a very different conversation from the last cycle’s purely speculative narrative. Retail traders might still chase memes, but institutions are quietly mapping out rails and cash‑flow models. In other words, you’re looking for tokens that either power the rails or make those rails useful to normal users. With that lens, three names stand out right now: PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as a mine‑to‑earn memecoin that gamifies infrastructure themes, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as an AI‑first creator economy play, and BNB ($BNB) as the blue‑chip chain asset that already benefits when stablecoin and AI activity hits scale. If BlackRock is leaning into AI and stablecoins as macro ‘mega forces,’ PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) tries to package that institutional thesis into something the retail market actually wants to touch: a gamified, mine‑to‑earn memecoin that runs entirely on virtual infrastructure instead of real‑world rigs. Think of it as a playful UX layer on top of serious Ethereum rails. There’s no hardware to assemble, no electricity bill, and no hash‑rate charts to decode – the ‘mining’ is abstracted into a dashboard that looks more like a mobile game than a mining pool. Under the hood, $PEPENODE is a standard ERC‑20 on Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake network, with smart contracts handling staking logic, node‑tier rewards, and governance hooks. The market seems to be noticing. The PEPENODE presale has already raised over $2.26M, with $PEPENODE currently priced at $0.0011778 – a sub‑penny entry point for a concept aiming to sit at the intersection of mining narratives, meme culture, and Ethereum yield. Join the $PEPENODE presale to get your mining nodes early. If BlackRock is right that AI will be a core driver of earnings growth, creator platforms built natively around AI tooling and crypto payments are a logical downstream bet. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is targeting exactly that intersection: Web3 rails plus AI workflows for an $85 billion‑plus content creation industry. Instead of surrendering margins to Web2 platforms, creators can token‑gate content, accept crypto – including stablecoins – and automate fan interactions using an AI personal assistant that runs 24/7. On‑chain, SUBBD leans on its native token for payments, access, and incentives. The presale has already raised $1.38M, with $SUBBD priced at $0.0571, signaling meaningful early demand for an AI‑centric creator stack that doesn’t rely on YouTube or TikTok economics. From a marketing perspective, the project is already ahead of the curve after contracting the top 2,000+ content creators, bringing a combined following of 250M+. Based on the project’s presale performance and innovative factor, a realistic price prediction for $SUBBD suggests a 2026 target of $0.48. Make that $2.50 by 2030, once the ecosystem sees mainstream adoption. In terms of raw numbers, we’re looking at ROIs of 740% and 4,278% respectively. If you want in, the earlier, the better. So, read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD today, while the presale is still open. Buy your $SUBBD on the official presale page. Every AI app, stablecoin payment, or mine‑to‑earn game ultimately needs a chain to live on. BNB ($BNB) is the blue‑chip way to express that view on the BNB Chain ecosystem, combining exchange utility with smart‑contract infrastructure that already handles massive throughput at low cost. Token‑economically, BNB combines that utility with a deflationary burn model, where periodic token burns reduce supply over time. That dynamic has underpinned its long‑term performance and helped keep BNB consistently in the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap as one of the leading exchange‑backed and smart‑contract platform tokens. $BNB is now trading at $910 after a 2.13% pump of the last week and a bullish behavior. If you want a large‑cap way to play the growth of AI apps and stablecoin flows on BNB Chain, $BNB remains the go‑to asset. Learn more about the ecosystem via its official website before buying. Get your $BNB on Binance today while it’s hot. Recap: As AI and stablecoins solidify into institutional ‘mega forces,’ PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), and BNB ($BNB) offer three very different but complementary angles – gamified mine‑to‑earn, AI creator infrastructure, and a blue‑chip chain. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing.

A BURGLAR WHO entered a hotel with a suitcase pretending to be a guest and stole alcohol before ordering breakfast and charging it to a room, has been jailed for three years. Enda Murray (44) of Bellavista Mews, Deansgrange Road, Blackrock, Co Dublin entered the Royal Marine Hotel in Dún Laoghaire carrying a suitcase on 3 February, 2025. He readjusted the camera in the hotel ballroom and stole €365 worth of alcohol. He then ordered breakfast and charged it to a room in the hotel. Murray who “only does commercial premises” pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to four separate incidents of burglaries in the Deansgrange and Dún Laoghaire areas between December 2024 and April 2025. He has 56 previous convictions including 14 for burglary. The court heard a manager of the Royal Marine Hotel discovered on 26 February that the camera in the Carlisle Suite of the hotel had been moved. CCTV footage from 3 February showed a male adjusting the camera towards the ceiling. A male was seen entering the hotel with a suitcase but it was established later he was not a guest. He attempted to open a till in the hotel’s Pavilion Bar, forced the shutters open and climbed into the bar. He opened the fridges and took items of alcohol worth €365. The court heard in doing so he caused €50 worth of damage. He then had breakfast and charged it to a room in the hotel. Murray was later identified from CCTV footage. Detective Garda Andrew Diamond told Patrick McCullough BL, prosecuting, that in another incident, Murray broke into Kelly’s Beauty in Deansgrange in the early hours of the morning on 20 April, 2025. It was discovered by the manager that a burglary had happened and CCTV was harvested. Murray was identified as having entered the premises through a residential home downstairs. The occupant was at home in bed asleep and was awoken after hearing noise and saw a man attempting to charge an electric scooter. Murray was removed from the premises by the injured party. He jumped out the window and was spoken to by gardaí. He admitted he had broken in and only went in to charge scooter. He told gardaí he “only does commercial premises”. The court heard that he was found with a crack pipe on him. He was detained in Dún Laoghaire Garda Station but was intoxicated and deemed unfit for interview. Advertisement Det Gda Diamond agreed with Oisin Clarke BL, defending, that when asked by gardaí, Murray pointed to the window he had jumped out of. On 25 January, 2025, Murray entered another pub in the city by putting a wheelie bin beside the wall. The court heard bottles of alcohol were taken and some were found smashed. A DNA match for Murray was made from blood-staining at the scene. Staff at Caribou bar on Stephen St. Lwr., Dublin 2, were closing up for the night on 14 April, 2025 when Murray came in and made conversation with a manager. The manager then went to attend to his duties but later noticed his iPhone had been stolen. The court heard the phone was valued at €1,000. CCTV was viewed and Murray was identified by gardaí. On the same date, Murray entered through an unsecured window of the Shelbourne Hotel after climbing over a locked gate and took €600 from the float. He was identified from CCTV and detained but nothing of evidential value arose. He entered pleas on first occasion, and no victim impact statements were made. Detective Garda Robert Mahony agreed with Mr Clarke who said: “his mother is at the end of her rope with him” and “he’s at an age where he needs to cop himself on.” The garda also agreed Murray committed mostly “nuisance type offences’ which would normally be dealt with at the district court but due to the volume of them they were sent forward to the circuit court. Det Gda Mahony further agreed they were “all opportunistic offences” and that Murray “sees something and will take it”. At one pub he did not appear to have item with him to put the alcohol he stole into. He smashed some of them on the ground because he was not able to carry them and lost a number of them before he even got out. In mitigation, Mr Clarke said Murray has no partner and no children and is “currently clean”. He is serving a sentence with his earliest release date being 31 October, 2027, the court heard. Passing sentence yesterday, Judge Orla Crowe noted all were commercial premises except one. However, the judge said they were still “violations of people’s businesses”. Judge Crowe said the offences were opportunistic but caused inconvenience and noted none of the property was recovered. The judge noted “the lack of finesse” of Murray throwing bottles out of Kehoe’s pub because he had no bag with him. The judge said Murray “was clearly in the grip of considerable drug addiction”. Judge Crowe sentenced him to three years and nine months imprisonment with the final nine months suspended to incentivise rehabilitation.

XRP extended its recovery with a clean push through $2.197 resistance, signaling renewed bullish momentum as institutional accumulation reappeared at key levels. XRP traded between $2.19 and $2.20 for most of the session before a brief liquidity sweep drove price to $2.15 during the largest volume event of the day. Buyers immediately absorbed the move, pushing the token back above $2.17 and maintaining higher lows on every subsequent retest. The breakout through $2.197 triggered a clean move to $2.206, supported by hourly volume rising from 450K to 553K. Price stabilized above $2.204 into the close while $2.22 emerged as the next resistance level to clear. Intraday momentum remained constructive, though upside continuation now depends on maintaining structure above $2.204 and avoiding deeper tests of $2.17. • The $2.204 micro-support is now the immediate pivot — holding above it keeps the breakout active• A break above $2.22 opens direct continuation toward the $2.33–$2.40 resistance band• Rejection at $2.22 combined with rising funding rates increases the risk of a leverage flush• Losing $2.17 would shift focus back to the broader $2.00 psychological level• Volume confirmation remains key — sustained prints above 600K/hour would support another expansion leg More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Japan’s Higher Rates Puts Bitcoin in the Crosshairs of a Yen Carry Unwind A stronger yen typically coincides with de-risking across macro portfolios, and that dynamic could tighten liquidity conditions that recently helped bitcoin rebound from November’s lows.

Speaking at the New York Times DealBook Summit with host and journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Armstrong said recent moves on stablecoin and market-structure legislation signalled a shift in the policy landscape. “2025 is actually the year that crypto regulation went from kind of gray market to well-lit establishment,” he said. “The Genius Act passed, the House passed a market-structure bill in a bipartisan way that’s now moving on to the Senate, and I think that’s going to be the first one where the Senate passes it as well.” Armstrong criticized federal policy under the previous Biden Administration, saying it “unlawfully tried to kill this industry, which pushed a lot of activity offshore and hurt consumers.” “That’s why we’ve supported groups like Fairshake,” he said, referring to the crypto-focused SuperPAC. “Because 52 million Americans who have used crypto want to see clear rules on the books. All of our political spending is transparent.” During the 2024 U.S. election season, Fairshake raised over $78 million to support pro-crypto candidates, with eyes on the 2026 mid-term elections. When asked how he viewed past criticisms of Bitcoin by Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger, who had called it “nothing,” “rat poison,” likened it to a “venereal disease,” and predicted it would go to zero. Armstrong said there was “no chance” of that happening at this point." “For Charlie and Warren, they grew up in an era of American preeminence, where the dollar was everything, and you didn’t question it,” he said. “Bitcoin is this new digital gold, and people go to it in times of uncertainty. So it's tough for them to contemplate a world that is more decentralized and running on the internet.” During the interview, Fink spoke about how conversations with clients influenced his change of heart and the way he now approaches Bitcoin after calling it “an index for money laundering in the past. “I see a big, large use case for Bitcoin, and I still do today,” he said. “In my role, I see thousands of clients a year. I meet with governmental leaders, and we have conversations that evolve my thinking. This is a very public example of a big shift in my opinion.” Fink went on to say that while he sees a strong case for Bitcoin, he still sees it as “an asset of fear” in times of uncertainty. “You own Bitcoin because you're frightened of your physical and financial security,” he said. “The long-term reason you own it is the debasement of financial assets because of deficits.” During the panel, the question of stablecoins and bank anxiety over losing deposits to tokenized systems was raised, but Armstrong pushed back. “In that case, I think that's just the banks trying to protect their profit margin,” he said. “They should have to pay rewards and higher rates to their own customers, and they're trying to put their thumb on the scale of regulatory capture to prevent crypto from doing that.” Armstrong, instead, predicted that banks would soon start embracing stablecoins. “We're already seeing this,” he said. “My guess is that in a year or two, they'll come back and say they want to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in their own companies. “It goes back to the Innovator's Dilemma,” he said. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity, and the ones fighting it are going to get left behind.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Polymarket Bettors Still Expect Big Strategy Buys Even as Saylor Prepares for a Weak Market

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.A new CryptoQuant report suggests that Strategy is quietly preparing for a multi-month BTC downturn. This thesis is colliding with prediction markets bets that still believe the company will behave as if it were 2021. CryptoQuant highlights in its most recent weekly report that Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury company is undergoing a structural pivot from aggressive BTC accumulation to balance-sheet protection, highlighted by a separate USD reserve and language acknowledging the option to hedge or even sell in stressed conditions. Despite that shift, Polymarket odds for a bitcoin sale remain marginal for the first quarter of the year, while expectations for routine small buys stay elevated. Additionally, Polymarket traders still see routine MSTR purchases as a high-probability event, even as the scale of those buys shrinks. The market assigns only a 40%–45% chance of a buy above 1,000 BTC, and the CryptoQuant report suggests these cosmetic top-ups are becoming the norm. With monthly accumulation down more than 90% from last year, traders expect small buys that preserve branding without affecting supply or regional liquidity. Strategy’s average purchase size has fallen from 15,133 BTC in 2024 to 5,330 BTC this year, and with DAT inflows at their weakest since mid-June, bitcoin treasury firms are no longer absorbing meaningful supply in the current market. Taken together, slower treasury buying, weaker DAT inflows, and a more defensive MSTR suggest a different supply landscape ahead for crypto in 2026. Whether BTC can resume its upward trend will hinge on new sources of demand stepping in to replace the corporate accumulation that defined the last cycle. BTC: Bitcoin recovered from its morning drop to $91,800 and steadied near $93,000, but its two-day 10% rally is stalling below resistance at the 2025 yearly open around $93,400. ETH: Ether climbed back above $3,100 and reached a two-week high near $3,200 after a 3.5% gain on the day. Gold: Gold slipped slightly to just above $4,200 as traders stayed cautious ahead of key U.S. inflation data, although renewed Ukraine tensions and a softer dollar outlook could set the stage for a rebound. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks traded mixed Thursday, though Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Topix rose about 1.3% after upbeat U.S. jobs data lifted Wall Street and strengthened hopes for a Fed rate cut next week.

Title: Vanguard’s Policy Reversal Triggers Sharp Bitcoin Rally as $11T Giant Enters Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/vanguards-policy-reversal-triggers-bitcoin-rally/
Time Published: 2025-12-04T00:00:20Z
Full Content:
A new CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan reveals that the sharp +6% Bitcoin rally on December 2–3, 2025 was triggered by a seismic shift in traditional finance: Vanguard’s unexpected policy reversal. The $11 trillion asset manager—long known for its conservative stance—opened its platform to spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, instantly giving more than 50 million investors access to crypto products. The move marks one of the most significant steps toward mainstream adoption in the industry’s history. The catalyst behind this reversal was the appointment of Salim Ramji, Vanguard’s new CEO and a former BlackRock executive who played a key role in launching the IBIT ETF. His leadership signaled a dramatic change in direction, and the market responded immediately. Once US markets opened, Bitcoin surged 6% in a single move, while IBIT surpassed $1 billion in trading volume within the first 30 minutes. Massive inflows from retail and retirement accounts followed, with Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noting that “a large wave of Vanguard clients may have moved all at once.” XWIN Research Japan notes that, despite the recent surge, the Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing that US prices still sit slightly below global averages. Even so, the report highlights a clear improvement in US spot buying pressure, signaling that demand is slowly returning. If the premium rises back to zero or positive territory, the market may begin to price in what XWIN calls the “next wave” — a phase that could propel Bitcoin toward the $100K range as institutional flows strengthen. This shift is happening just as Vanguard makes its historic entrance into the crypto market. XWIN emphasizes that this is not a short-term catalyst. Vanguard manages $11 trillion, and even a tiny allocation — just 0.5% of assets flowing into crypto ETFs — would represent $55 billion in new capital. That figure alone exceeds the entire first-year inflow from the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF cycle. With the “final giant” of traditional finance now participating, the long-term structure of Bitcoin demand is changing. Vanguard’s move signals the beginning of a genuine institutional adoption phase, where inflows can scale far beyond anything seen in previous cycles, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s upper price boundaries. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the $84,000–$86,000 support zone, an area that aligns closely with the 100-week SMA. This level acted as a critical pivot during previous corrections, and once again buyers stepped in aggressively, forming a clear bullish reaction. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong demand, with BTC now trading back above $93,000. However, despite the rebound, the broader structure remains cautious. Bitcoin still trades below the 50-week SMA, which has begun to flatten near the $102,000–$103,000 region. This moving average now acts as a major resistance level and the next key test for bulls. A weekly close above it would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and signal that BTC may be ready to resume its broader uptrend. If BTC continues to hold above the 100-week SMA and pushes toward the 50-week SMA, the market could enter a consolidation phase that sets the stage for a stronger upside move. Failure to reclaim $102K, however, risks renewed selling pressure and a potential retest of the $86K region.

The firm says that mega forces, or major structural changes that affect investments now and in the future, are changing the global economy. The most dominant mega force is AI, according to its 2026 outlook report. “With a few mega forces driving markets, it is hard to avoid making a big call on their direction – and as such, there is no neutral stance, not even exposure to broad indexes,” BlackRock’s report reads. “We remain pro-risk and see the AI theme still the main driver of U.S. equities. Yet this environment is ripe for active investing – picking winners and losers from among the builders now and later as AI gains start to spread, in our view.” The firm’s report also highlights the role of stablecoins in the “future of finance,” a mega force it says characterizes the changes in “how households and companies use cash, borrow, transact and seek returns.” That definition has now expanded to include crypto and stablecoins, a representative for the firm told Decrypt. “Stablecoins are no longer niche–they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” BlackRock’s Global Head of Market Development Samara Cohen said. The firm also sees the potential for stablecoins to grow beyond banking, indicating a potential role in cross-border payments and as alternatives to local currencies in emerging markets. The total stablecoin market cap has grown by more than $100 billion since this time last year, according to data from DefiLlama, with more than $307 billion in stablecoins—led by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, now circulating. Despite their rapid growth, predictors on Myriad’s prediction market think it’s unlikely that the total market cap will spike to $360 billion by February. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) In addition to stablecoin growth, the firm pointed to the fragmentation of AI and defense, growing energy constraints for the AI build, and a new uneven phase for private credit as underlying themes impacting broader mega forces. Over the next six to 12 months, it remains committed to AI thanks to good earnings figures and healthy balance sheets, signaling AI favor as one of its “big calls” moving forward. “We stay overweight U.S. stocks on the broadening AI theme, with risk appetite supported by Fed rate cuts,” the firm wrote.

Title: Trump’s Ballroom Donors Blow Off Senator’s Questions About How Much They Gave

This year, the holidays don’t feel celebratory for many Americans who’ve been negatively affected by the Trump administration’s decisions. We’re here to make sure those people do not go unheard. Help us hold the administration accountable. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump released a list of private donors paying for the construction of his 90,000-square-foot, $300 million White House ballroom — and the demolition of the East Wing — he left lots of questions unanswered. How much money did these billionaires and corporate CEOs give? Who approached them about donating in the first place? Are they expecting something in return? Are they actively lobbying the White House for other perks for their businesses or themselves? Was this even a complete list of all the donors behind the ballroom project? (It was not.) Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, posed these questions to more than 30 of the known donors financing Trump’s ballroom project, in a series of letters that went out in late October. He gave them until early November to respond. The donors’ response letters, obtained by HuffPost, are remarkably evasive. The 21 responses ― two came from contractors on the project, the rest from companies that donated ― almost universally do not answer Blumenthal’s questions, instead boasting about their philanthropy and love of America. Blumenthal posed very specific questions, like, “What amount did you contribute to the White House Ballroom project?” and “Please list all White House personnel or other representatives or associates of the Trump Administration or Trump family with whom you have spoken about the donation.” Some of the responses were laughable. Apple, Amazon and Meta, who are among the Big Tech companies financing Trump’s project, said their support for the ballroom is simply another example of them donating money to a good cause. None actually said how much money they gave, or who they worked with in Trump’s orbit to make the donations happen. Meta unironically suggested it is financing the ballroom project because it cares about preserving the White House grounds — as Trump just razed the entire East Wing to make way for his project. (HuffPost obtained copies of the letters on the condition to not directly quote them.) Other donors, like cryptocurrency companies Coinbase and Ripple and major government contractor Booz Allen, similarly claimed their donations are motivated by civic pride and a commitment to protecting the White House. Booz Allen in particular hailed the White House as a symbol of American democracy and said it is proud to help support the building, part of which, again, Trump just completely demolished. The only company that divulged its donation in its letter was Google, and it only did so because it’s already been reported that it’s donating $22 million as part of a settlement the company reached with Trump after he was banned from YouTube, owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, after he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Most of these donors insisted they are following all laws and aren’t giving money to the ballroom project in exchange for other perks from Trump. Some companies, including Comcast and BlackRock, claimed they blindly donated money to the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit partner to the National Park Service that accepts private money for repairs and upgrades to national monuments and grounds, and had no say in their funds going specifically toward Trump’s ballroom. Others, like Nvidia and the Betty Wold Johnson Foundation, confirmed they donated to the trust specifically to aid Trump’s project. One company that won’t be kicking in money for the White House ballroom is JPMorgan Chase. Its CEO, Jamie Dimon, said last month on CNN that the company has a lot of government contracts within and outside of the U.S., and it has to be careful about how its arrangements are perceived and how a future Justice Department may deal with them. “We’re quite conscious of risks we bear by doing anything that looks like, you know, buying favors or anything like that,” Dimon said. Trump’s ballroom project is unpopular with the public. An ABC News/Washington Post survey from late October found just 28% of Americans backed the ballroom’s construction, with 56% opposed.
