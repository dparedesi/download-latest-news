Title: ‘If I can help someone, I will’: the Dublin woman who has been providing Christmas dinners for 39 years

“I won’t be here forever and these people cannot be left without,” said Dubliner Margaret Brown, who has been providing Christmas dinners to those in need and the homeless for almost four decades. Mrs Brown, from Sandycove in south Co Dublin, has been organising the festive feast since 1986 after she and her late mother saw people in a scout hall eating lumpy soup and cold meat while huddled around a gas-fired heater. “Running out of turkey 39 years ago when I first started cooking dinners with my mother, I never thought I would be doing this all these years later,” she said. “But thankfully I can still do this; for how much longer I do not know.” Mrs Brown, who is in her 80s, originally organised her annual Christmas dinners in Blackrock Rugby Club in south Dublin. In the past, high-profile names such as rock band U2 have surprised guests at the annual Christmas dinner when people gathered at the rugby club. Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything and forced Mrs Brown and scores of volunteers to turn to making takeout meals instead. Now the new tradition of delivering the five-course feast of a full Christmas dinner, with pudding and mince pies, is here to stay. “I won’t be here forever, but I’ll keep making the dinners with the help of so many wonderful volunteers thanks to donations we receive from food producers,” said Mrs Brown. The numbers she is feeding have surpassed 200, which is normally the cut-off number she and her team can cook for. “The numbers we could provide for filled our list way in advance of the cut-off date,” she said. “There are so many new people, many of whom are younger, not just older individuals who are lonely and homeless, which is shocking.” The 39 years she has been feeding people has passed “in the blink of an eye” and the needs of people have changed in that time. “There have been a lot of changes in social needs over those years and food provisions have to meet those demands,” she said. The team of volunteers will be cooking for 60 people living in Bethany House for the homeless in Dún Laoghaire. There will also be a special meal for Travellers living in Carrickmines who lost several family members in a blaze 10 years ago. [ ‘So long as these people are here, we’ll never starve’: In the queue for Christmas vouchers at Dublin’s Capuchin Day CentreOpens in new window ] “It takes a lot of preparation in the lead-up to Christmas Day, receiving donations, streamlining of cooking times, delivering the food to people, or them calling to the rugby club at specific times and ensuring no one is forgotten,” said Mrs Brown. Her giving has not just been at Christmas. In 2019 she helped repatriate the remains of an Irishman, Joseph Tuohy from Toomevara, Co Tipperary, as he had no known relatives still alive, and helped prepare a funeral for him. Mr Tuohy, who died in his late 80s, was separated from his mother at age five and spent his childhood in orphanages and St Joseph’s Industrial School in Clonmel. He emigrated to London in his late teens and never returned to Ireland, losing contact with his family. He experienced periods of homelessness and illness in London. Mrs Brown was contacted about his case in her capacity as a volunteer for the Friends of the Forgotten Irish Emigrants, who launched an appeal to Mr Tuohy’s relatives and for people to attend his funeral. His ashes were subsequently laid in consecrated ground in Tipperary. “I didn’t set out for my life to be like this, or to become known for trying to help others, but life can be so difficult for so many and if I can help someone I will,” said Mrs Brown.

Title: Extended crypto ETF outflows shows institutions disengaging: Glassnode

Time Published: 2025-12-24T05:18:30Z

Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have recorded sustained outflows since early November, which Glassnode says signals institutional disengagement. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds have seen a prolonged streak of outflows, indicating that institutional investors have disengaged with crypto, said the analytics platform Glassnode. Since early November, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs has turned negative, Glassnode said on Tuesday. “This persistence suggests a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market,” it added. Flows into crypto ETFs usually lag the spot markets for the tokens, which have been trending down since mid-October. The ETFs are also considered a bellwether for institutional sentiment, which has been a market driver for most of this year but seemingly turned bearish as the wider market has contracted. Coinglass said aggregate Bitcoin ETF flows have been in the red for the past four consecutive trading days. However, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen minor inflows over the past week. “Crypto ETF selling pressure is back,” the Kobeissi Letter said on Tuesday. It reported that crypto funds recorded $952 million in outflows last week, and investors have now withdrawn capital in six out of the last ten weeks. Related: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks Despite the recent outflows, the industry-dominant BlackRock fund has seen $62.5 billion in inflows since inception, eclipsing all rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Saturday that IBIT is the only ETF on Bloomberg’s “2025 Flow Leaderboard” with a negative return for the year. “The real takeaway is that it was sixth place despite the negative return,” he added. Balchunas said that BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin fund even took in more than the SPDR Gold Shares fund (GLD), which was up 64%.

Title: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP, currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently fallen below the crucial $2 mark amid a broader market correction that has dampened investor sentiment since October. However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year.

Title: Amplify ETFs for stablecoins, tokenization go live for trading

Two new exchange-traded funds from Amplify track companies building the infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenization, blending stocks and crypto. Cointelegraph in your social feed Digital asset manager Amplify has launched two exchange-traded funds tracking blockchain projects across stablecoins and tokenization. The company said on Tuesday that its Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) both went live on the NYSE Arca exchange. Both funds track a diversified index of companies working on products or infrastructure, along with projects that generate revenue from tokenization and stablecoins. “These new ETFs expand Amplify’s lineup at a time when the infrastructure behind stablecoins and the growth of tokenization are shaping the next phase of digital finance,” the company said. Stablecoins and tokenization have been among the most popular themes in crypto this year, with the US passing laws that have given institutions confidence to launch stablecoins, and regulators opening dialogue on how they should treat assets such as tokenized stocks. Amplify said its stablecoin-focused ETF tracks shares of companies “generating significant revenue from payments technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms.” It holds shares in companies working on stablecoins such as Visa, Circle, Mastercard and PayPal, alongside crypto ETFs from Grayscale, iShares and Bitwise. The firm pointed to regulatory developments in the US and EU, noting that the “GENIUS Act in the US and MiCA in Europe are positioning stablecoins as the compliant backbone of digital finance.” Related: Clarity Act delays led to $952M in crypto fund outflows: CoinShares Meanwhile, the tokenization fund includes exposure to BlackRock, JPMorgan, Figure Technology Solution, Citigroup and the Nasdaq, which all have made tokenization plays over the past few years as they seek opportunities to digitize traditional financial services. Crypto and blockchain ETFs stormed onto the market in 2025 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission under chair Paul Atkins loosened requirements for crypto ETFs.

Title: JPMorgan to allow crypto trading for institutional clients in latest embrace of the sector
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/23/jpmorgan-to-allow-crypto-trading-for-institutional-clients/
Time Published: 2025-12-23T20:16:40Z

JPMorgan is making another big bet on crypto. The Wall Street giant is considering letting institutional clients trade cryptocurrency, according to reporting on Monday from Bloomberg. These products and services may reportedly include spot and derivatives trading, and the efforts are still in their early stages. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The move comes amid the company’s broader embrace of digital assets. In October, the bank announced that it would allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral. And earlier in December, JPMorgan’s asset management arm launched its first tokenized money fund. The bank’s recent expansion of crypto is notable given how CEO Jamie Dimon has long expressed contempt for the sector. As recently as last year, Dimon compared Bitcoin to a “pet rock”, and said that its only uses were for money laundering and fraud, among other illegal activities. The remarks followed other insults Dimon has heaped on crypto over the years. JPMorgan’s pivot towards crypto follows President Donald Trump’s more favorable policies toward the sector. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation was enacted as Trump’s family profited from the industry. Given the new regulatory landscape for crypto, other major financial companies have also been hopping on the bandwagon. BlackRock manages close to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $11 billion in Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, fellow financial giant Fidelity is involved in crypto staking, while Goldman Sachs has a private blockchain that is testing tokenized fund redemptions. And UBS, Citi, and HSBC have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and crypto custody services. Wall Street’s latest digital asset adoption has not, however, translated to big price wins for the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down about 30% to roughly $87,000 since its high of $126,000 in early October. Ethereum is also down roughly 30% in the last three months to $2,919, and Solana is down roughly 43% to $123.07 during that same time period. It appears that the big banks are taking a long-term view on crypto and are not being scared off by this recent dip.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Executive John Ameriks emphasized Vanguard’s core view of the crypto sector hasn’t changed, seeing the asset class as highly speculative. Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant’s begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Title: Ethereum is vanishing from exchanges, and the massive wallets absorbing it prove you aren’t the target audience anymore

Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) broke its 2021 all-time high in August, brushing $4,945 and a $600 billion market cap, while exchange balances hit record lows. Corporate treasuries and spot ETFs now control nearly 11% of the circulating supply. By every structural metric, ETH should feel like it's having a moment. It doesn't. No Bored Apes are selling for seven figures. No TikTok explainers are going viral. The 2025 ETH rally is real, measurable, and entirely clinical. This is a quiet reallocation by institutions treating Ethereum less like a speculative trade and more like yield-bearing infrastructure. The cultural void raises a sharper question: is ETH transitioning from layer-1 casino to institutional plumbing, and what does price discovery look like when the buyers don't care about hype? The supply story is unambiguous. Only 10.5% of all ETH now sits on centralized exchanges as of Dec. 21, one of the lowest shares since the network launched and down 43% since July, per Coinglass data. Additionally, more than 35.6 million ETH is locked in staking as of Dec. 20. This isn't speculative hoarding, but rather an operational infrastructure. Nansen's holder composition shows the largest addresses are staking contracts, institutional custodians, and ETF wrappers, not whale wallets. Exchange float is draining, but not into day-trading accounts. It's moving into pipes: layer-2 bridges, restaking protocols, treasury vaults. Corporate balance sheets tell the same story. Treasury data from Dec. 19 estimates that corporate holders plus spot Ethereum ETFs now control 10.72% of the circulating supply. This is divided in 5.63% in corporate hands and 5.09% in ETFs, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data. BitMine has accumulated over 4 million ETH, equivalent to 3.36% of the total supply, and has explicit plans to reach 5%. These aren't venture bets, but strategic positions tied to Ethereum's role in stablecoin settlement and tokenized asset rails. ETF flows confirm the institutional tilt. Year-to-date, ETPs tracking ETH have drawn about $12.7 billion in net inflows, with US spot Ethereum ETFs representing $12.4 billion. The infrastructure is built. The allocators are here. The 2025 research cycle has started treating ETH as yield-bearing infrastructure rather than a levered bet on tokens. Citi's September note setting a $4,300 year-end target is explicit: the driver is demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins and tokenization, not speculative trading. The bank highlights staking yield as a differentiator for corporate portfolios, sketching a bull case to $6,400 if stablecoin adoption evolves on the optimistic trajectory. Binance Research argued that if stablecoin settlement and layer-2 scaling continue on current trends, ETH's valuation logic shifts from “deflationary asset” to “ecological infrastructure asset.” Data from rwa.xyz shows that Ethereum controls $12.5 billion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market, equivalent to 66.6%. Ethereum's growth in RWA tokenization since 2024 has been stellar, rising from $1.5 billion, representing a 735% increase from its current size. Stablecoin usage also skyrocketed. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum recorded $1.6 trillion in monthly stablecoin transaction volume as of Dec. 21 and $172.1 billion in stablecoin supply. Supply growth is 141% compared to the $71.3 billion seen in January 2024. The thesis emerging from these reports is consistent: ETH is increasingly treated like a yield-bearing, rails-of-the-system asset in professional portfolios. It's about needing Ethereum to function as plumbing for tokenized dollars, securities, and derivatives that institutions are already building. NFTs are the clearest cultural contrast. Data from CryptoSlam shows NFT art sales plunging from nearly $16.5 billion in 2021 to just $2.2 billion in 2025, a drop of roughly 87%. LG shut down its Art Lab NFT marketplace, Tennis Australia's Artball collection saw floor prices collapse by around 90%, and CryptoPunks were transferred to a non-profit, with coverage bluntly observing that the “money-making days” are over. Google Trends data shows that crypto-related searches in the US remain well below prior-cycle peaks, rising to 100 only when prices grind higher between July and August. The participation mix confirms the shift. Retail mania has rotated heavily into US single-stock trading rather than altcoins. Ethereum ETP flows swing between huge inflow weeks and very large outflow weeks, more like a tug-of-war between structured products than a one-way retail stampede. The mismatch between accumulation and attention creates a medium-term puzzle. Traditional price discovery depends on a mix of fundamental flows and narrative momentum. Ethereum in 2025 has the former without the latter. ETFs and treasuries provide slow, steady demand. Staking locks up supply, and tokenization brings real-world assets to Ethereum. But the cultural engine that drove 2021, consisting of retail users treating every transaction like a statement, has stalled. This matters because Ethereum's valuation has always been partly reflexive. The network becomes more valuable as more applications build on it, partly because developers expect it to grow in value. That virtuous cycle depends on momentum, not just infrastructure. When corporate buyers treat ETH as a tool to settle tokenized bonds rather than a bet on the future of finance, they stabilize the asset but flatten its narrative arc. The wire shows ETH buying. The data shows supply draining from exchanges. What's missing is the cultural proof that any of this matters to anyone outside the trade.

Title: Will XRP Hit $5 in 2026? 5 Catalysts That Could Make It Happen—And 3 Risks That Won’t

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has spent years moving in tight ranges, but 2026 is shaping up as a decisive period. With institutional interest building, new products on the horizon, and macro conditions beginning to shift, investors are asking a sharper question than ever: will XRP hit $5 in 2026? Some believe a clear set of catalysts could finally unlock that level. Others argue that the same risks that held XRP back before still apply. To understand what comes next, it helps to separate what could realistically drive a move for the XRP price to $5 from what could prevent it. Andrey Gorgots / Shutterstock.com XRP reaching $5 in 2026 requires specific drivers working together. Five catalysts are already in motion, and each one addresses a different barrier that has kept the XRP price range-bound. Speculation around a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF sits at the top of the list because of what it represents: scale, credibility, and regulated access. Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows, led by Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. Market observers have pointed out that XRP-linked funds appear less sensitive to short-term macro stress, suggesting a different investor base. While BlackRock stated in August 2025 that it has no immediate plans for an XRP ETF, analysts believe regulatory clarity and sustained ETF demand could change that calculus. If BlackRock eventually moves forward, estimates suggest inflows could reach $2 billion or more. That level of capital would reshape demand and strengthen the case for XRP hitting $5. It would also position XRP as the only crypto asset with an ETF tied to a fully regulated token in the U.S. Japan is quietly becoming one of the most important regions in the long-term XRP story. Ripple and SBI Holdings plan to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by Q1 2026 through SBI VC Trade, pending regulatory approval. The project is being built through licensed trust banks and exchanges under Japan’s Payment Services Act. Japan accounts for more than half of Ripple’s global payment volume. When regulated stablecoins become part of domestic and cross-border settlement, XRPL’s role as an infrastructure gains relevance. Banks using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger create real demand for XRP as a bridge currency. This supports the XRP reaching $5 case, even if the impact builds gradually over quarters. Tokenization is where blockchain adoption moves beyond theory. Ripple’s expanded relationship with Archax—a regulated digital securities exchange—reflects this shift. The partnership aims to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tokenized equities, debt, and funds onto XRPL by mid-2026. Archax operates in a regulated environment and has already shown that tokenized traditional assets can function at scale. XRPL’s fast settlement—transactions clear in 3-5 seconds—and low fees make it suitable for this use case. Traditional securities settlement can take days and cost significantly more. As global consulting firms project tokenized assets reaching trillions of dollars by the end of the decade. If XRPL captures even 5-10% of tokenized asset settlement, the utility demand for XRP multiplies, and this harnesses its case of reaching $5 in 2026. Macro policy remains one of the most important background forces shaping XRP’s upside potential. Expected Federal Reserve rate cuts would lower returns on cash and short-term bonds, historically pushing capital toward risk assets offering growth and liquidity. Large-cap digital assets usually benefit first from this shift, especially those with deep markets and improving regulatory clarity. XRP fits that profile—consistent volume, global recognition, and increasing institutional discussion. Rate cuts don’t cause price rallies by themselves, but they change behavior. Capital becomes more willing to take exposure, and risk tolerance rises across portfolios. In that environment, questions like “will XRP hit $5” move from speculation to portfolio debate as allocation decisions begin to shift. Supply dynamics add another layer to this outlook, and recent on-chain data makes the shift hard to ignore. Exchange-held XRP fell sharply, with 1.35 billion XRP pulled off exchanges in less than two months. Balances dropped from roughly 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than 1 billion leaving in just three weeks. This pace suggests a decisive change in behavior. Large withdrawals signal that holders are moving XRP into longer-term storage—cold wallets and institutional custody—rather than keeping it readily available for sale. While this doesn’t guarantee higher prices, it does reduce immediate sell pressure and tightens available liquidity. If demand rises through ETFs, institutional participation, or settlement-related use while supply remains constrained, price movements can accelerate. This is why exchange outflows feature so prominently in discussions about XRP’s upside potential heading into 2026. Tamisclao / Shutterstock.com Even with multiple bullish drivers in place, there are clear risks that could prevent XRP from reaching higher levels. These risks are structural and they explain why the question of XRP hitting $5 still divides investors. The largest risk remains regulation. XRP’s progress over the past year has been closely tied to improving legal clarity and regulatory acceptance following the August 2025 SEC settlement. That progress underpins institutional interest and ETF-related momentum. However, regulatory environments can change quickly. A tougher stance from U.S. regulators, new compliance requirements, or delays in XRP ETF approvals could slow institutional participation. For large investors, certainty matters more than speed, and any sign of reversal would likely pause capital inflows and weaken confidence. Ownership concentration is another important risk. XRP has a history of large holders selling into strength. When price moves higher, these holders often take profits, increasing sell pressure at key resistance levels. This behavior can flatten rallies even when broader sentiment is positive. If distribution accelerates during a breakout attempt, demand from ETFs or retail investors may struggle to absorb the supply. This dynamic has capped previous rallies and remains a real obstacle to XRP reaching the $5 target. The final risk sits outside the crypto market entirely. A global economic slowdown or recession would reduce appetite for risk assets across the board. In such conditions, investors typically rotate into cash, bonds, or defensive assets. Even strong crypto narratives struggle when liquidity tightens. If recession fears dominate in 2026—triggered by banking stress, geopolitical shocks, or persistent inflation—capital that might have flowed into digital assets could stay sidelined. You can have perfect fundamentals, but if the economy contracts, risk assets like XRP suffer. XRP reaching $5 wouldn’t come from a single headline or short burst of momentum. It would require a rare alignment of multiple forces playing out together. ETF inflows would need to remain strong and consistent, institutional adoption would have to translate into real, sustained capital commitment, macro conditions must stay supportive, supply conditions would need to remain tight, and whales would need to hold rather than distribute aggressively into strength. XRP hitting $5 requires all five catalysts to align while the three major risks stay dormant. BlackRock files an ETF, Japan launches RLUSD at scale, tokenization gains traction, the Fed cuts rates, and supply stays locked up—all while regulators stay friendly, whales hold their positions, and the economy avoids recession. It’s a narrow path, but possible. How many of these factors actually align will decide whether XRP hits $5 in 2026 or consolidates below $3 while building for a later run.

The network’s builders have historically focused on technical accomplishments and an ideal of decentralization so pure, critics say, that they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger economic and political picture. But this year, amidst seismic regulatory developments for the crypto industry, Ethereum has stealthily made huge inroads in arenas it long was perceived to have neglected. From Wall Street board rooms to social media timelines, 2025 was the year Ethereum finally conquered centralized institutions. For nearly half a decade, Wall Street veteran Vivek Raman has attempted to onboard top traditional finance players onto Ethereum. “They all told me to politely leave their offices for four years,” Raman told Decrypt. The executive figured a paradigm shift might come this year, given crypto’s newfound political influence. But even he was blown away by what 2025 reaped for Ethereum at an institutional level. “This year was validation beyond what we would have expected,” Raman said. In January, Raman co-founded Etherealize, an organization dedicated to making Ethereum “the backbone of global finance”. Over the course of this year, he said, centralized institutions have followed three significant trends when it comes to crypto. For one, they all are now “urgently” attempting to expand their businesses onto blockchain networks. Two: They have near-universally embraced Ethereum’s distinctive multi-layer network model as the way to do so. And three—perhaps most crucially—this embrace of Ethereum has come about organically, he claimed. “People have just chosen Ethereum, not because there's a [business development] team, but because it's the right place to do business,” Raman said. The success stories are almost too many to count. Base, the Coinbase-incubated layer-2 network built on Ethereum, has become one of the year's buzziest success stories in Wall Street circles. When financial services mainstay Fidelity began tokenizing assets this spring, it went with Ethereum to get the job done. So did the global banking cooperative SWIFT. And after Robinhood went all-in on offering tokenized stocks this summer, the trading giant opted to create its own layer-2 network on Ethereum. Beyond that, there’s the rest of globe: Upbit in South Korea, Ant Group in China, IHC in Abu Dhabi, Amundi in Europe, and Bailie Gifford in the UK. When those financial institutions—some of the most important in the world—dove headfirst into tokenization projects this year, they all chose Ethereum (generally via layer-2 networks) as the place to do business. Efficiency, automation, reduced counterparty risk, increased access to capital, transparency in some cases, privacy in others—there are many incentives drawing big institutions to crypto. But old school, risk-averse firms tend to move in a pack, and those in finance appear to have collectively chosen Ethereum as the default place to build on-chain this year, following similar moves made in 2024 by market leaders like BlackRock. After years of standing on the sidelines, these firms now feel emboldened to commit to Ethereum chiefly because the crypto industry has been legitimized by the U.S. government, Danny Ryan, an Etherealize co-founder and former Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a legal framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the United States. The law had little to do with integrating complex crypto maneuvers into the traditional financial system (a separate, pending crypto market structure bill covers such issues). But the GENIUS Act blessed the general concept of crypto as permissible, or perhaps more accurately, not impermissible, Ryan said. And ever since, the crypto-cautious dam on Wall Street has burst, with or without market structure legislation. “It didn't say, ‘Hey, all the capital markets you know and love are legal to put on a blockchain,’" Ryan said of the GENIUS Act. “It just said, ‘Hey, you can do things legally on blockchains. It's legitimate.’” “After GENIUS, it's almost like the winds are at our back,” Raman said. It’s not just external actors who have come to see Ethereum differently in 2025. Internally, leaders of the Ethereum Foundation have also made huge shifts this year, in an effort to revamp the network’s global image. “There were a lot of unhappy people internally and externally,” James Smith, the Ethereum Foundation’s head of ecosystem, told Decrypt of the nonprofit’s previous woes. For years, even Ethereum’s advocates complained that the network’s foundation had become mired in an isolated, holier-than-thou “ivory tower” approach—one that turned off key centralized institutions and small-scale crypto founders alike. Smith’s job this year has been to completely reinvent how the Ethereum Foundation engages with the rest of the world. “We’ve become much more intentional about how we engage with institutions in 2025,” he said. “We now have teams whose job is to help serious builders and enterprises plug into Ethereum.” Take, for instance, a new initiative at the Foundation to host one-day conferences focused on appealing to big business. One upcoming event will explain staking to corporate firms in Zurich. Another, in New York, will showcase the benefits of Ethereum’s privacy features to enterprise players. While such outreach might sound like a no-brainer, Smith says these efforts represent a “180 [degree] sea change” in the Ethereum Foundation’s approach. “This is a really big moment for Ethereum,” he said, “which is why this is really needed.” One growing sector that has become increasingly central to Ethereum this year—and thus to the Ethereum Foundation—has been artificial intelligence. As the AI agent economy takes off, Ethereum's developers are betting that bots will eventually become the network’s core user base. This fall, the Foundation launched a full-time team dedicated to AI—which is rolling out collaborations with tech giants including Google. Such alliances might seem counterintuitive for a network that has long pitched itself as a democratic alternative to the hyper-centralized power structures of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. But Davide Crapis, the head of Ethereum’s AI team, doesn’t see the network’s growing popularity among tech and financial elites as a problem. On the contrary, he sees it as an inevitable outcome of the network’s rise to dominance. “The focus needs to be on building the best decentralized technology we can offer,” Crapis said. “When they see the value, they will come.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Are altcoins coming back? Why 'Bitcoin season' has staying power in 2026
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-altcoins-coming-back-why-bitcoin-season-has-staying-power-in-2026
Time Published: 2025-12-23T12:15:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto traders and several metrics suggest that an altcoin season is nowhere to be seen as institutions help Bitcoin strengthen its grip on the market. Cointelegraph in your social feed Most altcoins are currently displaying bearish patterns that suggest “altcoin season” is not coming, according to numerous analysts, as Bitcoin dominance begins to rise again. Key takeaways: The Supertrend indicator flashes “sell,” which previously led to a 66% drop in the altcoin total market cap. Rising BTC dominance and a low altcoin season index show no signs of reversal. The ongoing sell-off in altcoins is reflected by the correction in TOTAL2, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC), that began on Oct. 10. Data from TradingView shows that TOTAL2 has decreased by 32% to $1.19 trillion in December from its all-time high of $1.77 trillion reached on Oct. 10. This drop has seen TOTAL2 lose above key support levels, including the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) currently at $1.3 trillion, as shown in the chart below. Related: Crypto altseason unlikely in 2026 as ‘blue-chip survivors’ to win out: Analyst The SuperTrend indicator also flashed a bearish signal when it reversed from red to green and moved above the price in mid-November. This indicator overlays the chart while tracking TOTAL2’s trend, like the moving averages. It incorporates the average true range in its calculations, which helps traders identify market trends. Previous confirmations from these two indicators were followed by 85.5% and 66% drawdowns during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets, as shown in the chart below. Altcoins are still stuck in the downtrend as TOTAL2 consolidates within an ascending triangle. “Altcoin market cap is coiling into a brutal downtrend,” Merlijn The Trader wrote in an X post analysis. Support at $1.15 trillion is holding for now, but “if this triangle breaks, we could see a -30% flush” to $830 billion, the analyst wrote, adding that the “altseason is not coming” until the resistance at $1.68 trillion is broken. “Alt season will never occur again,” wrote CryptoDaddi in a recent post on X, adding that going forward, money will be concentrated into a select few altcoins. Bitcoin's (BTC) grip on the cryptocurrency market has tightened in 2025, leaving little room for altcoins to outperform. After pushing past 65% in June, Bitcoin dominance, a metric measuring Bitcoin’s market share relative to the overall crypto market, dropped to 57% in September. Since then, the metric has been on an upward trend, recording higher highs and higher lows, as shown in the chart below. At the time of publication, BTC dominance is at 59.27%, indicating that it is still Bitcoin season. This metric has not dropped below 50% since September 2023, which has previously marked the start of the altseason. This is a structural shift driven by institutional adoption that came after the approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions from traditional finance. Institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity prioritize Bitcoin for its adoption, relative stability and regulatory clarity, viewing altcoins as riskier and less liquid. It’s not just aggressive buying by Strategy either. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF attracted over $25 billion in inflows in 2025, reinforcing the preference corporate buyers have for BTC over altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is printing a higher low, and money is rotating back into BTC, not alts,” said CyrilXBT in an X post, adding: Meanwhile, key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it’s still nowhere in sight. According to Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index, only 21% of the top altcoins have outperformed BTC during the last three-month period, suggesting capitulation among altcoin holders. Additionally, the Crypto Market Breadth, a measure of market strength, reveals that only 8% of all altcoins are trading above their 50-day moving average, suggesting that the altcoin market is extremely weak. Similarly, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 18 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin season is when the percentage is above 75%. “CMC Altcoin Season Index is at a record low,” said altcoin trader Money Ape in an analysis on X, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has outperformed most other cryptocurrency sectors in recent months, indicating that capital and investment continue to favor Bitcoin.

Title: Paramount's new offer for Warner Bros 'not sufficient'
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1223/1550321-paramounts-new-offer-for-warner-bros-not-sufficient/
Time Published: 2025-12-23T11:36:10Z

Paramount Skydance's latest offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery still is not good enough for prominent shareholder Harris Oakmark, the investor has told Reuters. Warner Bros' fifth largest shareholder, owning 96 million shares or about 4% of shares as of the end of September, said it would hold out for more from the Ellison family-controlled Paramount. "The changes in Paramount's new offer were necessary, but not sufficient," Harris Oakmark portfolio manager and Director of US Research Alex Fitch said in an email to Reuters. "We see the two deals as a toss-up, and there is a cost to changing paths. If Paramount is serious about winning, they’re going to need to provide a greater incentive," he added. Paramount yesterday amended its $108.4 billion hostile bid for the storied Hollywood studio to bolster its financing. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David owns Paramount, is now personally guaranteeing $40.4 billion of the bid to secure Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max and controls the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Superman franchises. Questions about the financing, much of which was held in a revocable trust, had some Warner Bros investors unsure whether they would accept the offer. Paramount also increased the fee it will pay to $5.8 billion from $5 billion if regulators do not approve the deal, to match a competing offer from Netflix, although it did not raise its $30-a-share bid. Warner Bros investors now have until January 21, extended from January 8, to accept or reject the so-called tender offer. The board of Warner Bros unanimously recommended on Wednesday that shareholders reject Paramount's earlier bid in favor of Netflix's offer, saying the financing didn't provide a "full backstop." Even though Netflix's cash offer of $23.25 a share is lower, the board said its bid was superior because the financing was more secure and it includes $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock as well as whatever Warner Bros can get when it spins out Discovery Global as part of the deal. The bidding war speaks to the quality of Warner Bros assets, said Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of Chicago investment firm IHT Wealth Management, which owns 16,000 shares of Warner Bros, 6,500 shares of Netflix and 60,000 of Paramount. "It’s really rare to get an opportunity to add top shelf media assets to your portfolio," he said, adding that he'll likely follow the board's advice on the sale. "They know the business inside out and have a better grasp of the nuances associated with the deal than we do." Investor Thomas Poehling, who owns 484,000 shares of Warner Bros and 639,000 of Paramount, said he will likely take the revised offer if Netflix does not counter because Paramount has a better chance of winning approval from regulators. Ellison's guarantee "adds a lot of stability to that offer and that removes a lot of the financing uncertainty," he said. Gheriani and Poehling are not the only investors to hold shares in the rival movie studios. Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock are Warner Bros' three largest shareholders, controlling at least 22% of the company between them. All three are also among the top ten investors in Paramount and Netflix. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: 7 Rising Stars who took Wall Street by storm after starting their careers in sports, science, and engineering

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Most people imagine Wall Street careers beginning in familiar ways: internships at major banks, economics coursework, and early exposure to markets. But some of the young professionals on Business Insider's 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street list started out somewhere entirely different, long before entering finance. One hoped to be a professional football player. Another was a collegiate golf champion with a goal of playing on all seven continents. A third conducted anthropology fieldwork in Sierra Leone. And another began in a chemistry lab before deciding research wasn't the right fit. We're looking back at this year's cohort, focusing on those whose formative professional years were spent far from trading floors and deal teams. Today, this group has gone on to find success across a spectrum of industry niches from investment banking and private equity to hedge funds and quantitative investing. Below, we're showcasing seven Rising Stars who switched careers, and how those beginnings helped steer their professional climb at firms like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and more. Their backgrounds are organized alphabetically by their last name. Lamar Cardinez, Blue Owl Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy. He thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance. After earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams. Cardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Catherine Kress, BlackRock Kress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making. Kress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a "dream job." She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute. But she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the "culmination" of her career, offering "unparalleled exposure" to global policymakers and business leaders. Jack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase Levendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron. In that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions. Josef Menasche, Goldman Sachs Menasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries. Today, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' secondaries advisory group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions. Aman Mittal, Moelis Mittal began his career studying electronics and communications engineering in India before joining Bain & Company as an analyst in its technology, media, and telecom practice. He later moved into digital-infrastructure advisory work and, at Moelis, has worked on more than 15 data-center-related transactions totaling more than $25 billion in value. His recent mandates include Apollo's acquisition of Stream Data Centers. And he helped Prime Data Centers, another platform in the space, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake to the institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. Nikunj Jain, Bridgewater Jain studied machine learning, taught undergraduate math, interned at Apple in machine learning engineering, and worked for the Department of Defense before joining Bridgewater, where he's now head of Asia research. After graduating from UC Berkeley in two and a half years, he pursued quantitative finance after a friend suggested it. He said he found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked" — a description he's shaken off by running a 15- to 20-person team synthesizing regional activity into trading signals at the giant hedge fund. Jackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley Before joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she told Business Insider. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." So she made the pivot to Wall Street. After holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks. Golf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents. Jump to

Title: Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g907zekllo
Time Published: 2025-12-23T06:01:14Z

The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. "Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target," they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was "really, really important", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. "The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data," he said. Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. "I think the two Kevins are great," Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for "regime change". Warsh had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. "He thinks you have to lower interest rates," Trump told the Journal. "And so does everybody else that I've talked to." Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him "great", adding that "he's a man who's been there a long time". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as "the more sensible choice", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success. Norad got some help from President Donald Trump as it marked its 70th year tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.

Title: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks

BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has featured on the $13.5 trillion asset manager's homepage, representing one of three major investment themes as the market heads into 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock says its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was one of its three biggest investment themes in 2025, putting it alongside Treasury bills and the largest US tech stocks. The asset manager named its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) alongside its ETF tracking Treasury bills and another tied to the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla. IBIT has attracted more than $25 billion in net inflows this year, ranking sixth among all ETFs and trailing broad index funds, despite the fund delivering a negative return so far for 2025. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said on Monday that BlackRock's naming IBIT signals the firm isn’t fazed by Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30% fall from its high set in October. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed a similar sentiment on Friday, saying if the ETF “can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year.” The $25 billion in inflows adds to the roughly $37 billion that IBIT brought in over 2024, bringing its total inflows since launch to $62.5 billion, Farside Investors data shows. IBIT’s flow tally is more than five times that of its nearest competitor, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).

The product seeks to sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures, collecting premiums to generate yield. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has exceeded expectations too, attracting over $9.1 billion worth of inflows this year, bringing its total tally to nearly $12.7 billion. It also filed to register an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF in November to complement ETHA. BlackRock initially opted not to incorporate staking in ETHA. However, a more crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission has loosened its ETF standards, allowing asset managers to experiment with new product ideas. BlackRock hasn’t participated in the altcoin ETF craze that other asset managers have taken part in, which has so far seen the likes of Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) products launch in recent months.

Title: Canada's Prime Minister Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as the next ambassador to Washington

Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that financier Mark Wiseman will be Canada's next ambassador to the U.S. Wiseman will assume the role on February 15 and will be involved in negotiations regarding the review of their free trade agreement TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as the country's next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners. Wiseman will assume the role on Feb. 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the U.S. regarding the review of their free trade agreement. “Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions.” Wiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated the deal during his first term in office and included a clause to possibly renegotiate it in 2026. Wiseman, 55, ran the investment fund of the Canada Pension Plan and also managed equity funds at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. He is a friend of Carney, who ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. In 2016 Wiseman became the senior managing director and global head of active equities at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Wiseman was once touted as a possible successor to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though his tenure at the company was cut short in 2019 when he departed after he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. He has since chaired the Alberta Investment Management Corp. “Mark Wiseman is a business type with Wall Street connections whose profile is in sync with the current focus on trade and economic investment of both the Carney government and the Trump administration. Yet, Wiseman has no prior diplomatic experience," said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. In October, Trump cut off tariff negotiations with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an antitariff advertisement in the U.S. It followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, as are 85% of U.S. electricity imports. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG Published Dec 23, 2025, 07:40 AM Updated Dec 23, 2025, 07:36 PM LONDON – Sir James Dyson is reshaping how he manages Britain’s biggest fortune, streamlining his sprawling business empire across three continents after new leaders took the reins of his family holding company. Weybourne, the Dyson family’s investment firm, has transferred funds totalling at least £624 million (S$1.08 billion) from a major UK entity in 2025 to its Singapore holding company, reducing the British unit’s share capital to £1, according to an analysis of registry filings by Bloomberg. It has also finalised earlier plans to close two British firms overseeing property investments and transferred part of their share capital to another entity in Singapore, where Mr Dyson’s eponymous vacuum maker has its global headquarters. Meanwhile, Weybourne has posted job openings in recent weeks for a “new team” in Singapore to support a multi-asset investment portfolio and has scaled back its US footprint after spending almost US$200 million (S$257 million) on New York real estate. A representative for the 78-year-old – Britain’s richest person with a net worth of about US$16.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index – declined to comment. The changes are likely “part of a multi-year succession road map”, said Mr Martin Roll, a global family business strategist and senior adviser at McKinsey & Co. It is “long-term planning”. The moves signal that Weybourne’s new leadership is leaving its mark on Mr Dyson’s fortune, taking steps to reduce the complexity of a business empire that has rapidly expanded in recent years, after he extracted large sums from his namesake technology company to diversify his wealth. Mr Martin Bowen, a legal veteran from Dyson Group, became Weybourne’s chief executive in February following the retirement of former army officer James Bucknall, who held the role for more than a decade. Mr Martin Bowen Weybourne also promoted senior money manager Jane Simpson to chief investment officer for its financial assets in a London-based role in 2024, when former BlackRock executive Alastair Peters became chief financial officer (CFO) in a previously unreported move. Weybourne’s new team in Singapore will work with the CFO unit led by Mr Peters, who turns 43 in December and forms part of a younger set of executives at the family investment firm. Mr Bowen, a former chief legal officer at Dyson’s technology firm who is 57 in December, is a decade younger than the former CEO Mr Bucknall, highlighting how longstanding money managers of the super-rich need to hone succession plans for their own leadership as well as for their employers. At least a fifth of the world’s 500 richest people now have a family office, helping preserve fortunes totalling more than US$5 trillion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. “People forget that family offices are another family business,” said Ms Christina Wing, co-founder of Wingspan Legacy Partners, which advises billionaire dynasties. “They also need to change.” Like many family offices, Weybourne reflects its founder’s roots, bearing the name of a coastal village in the part of England where Mr Dyson grew up. The month after Mr Bowen became its CEO in February, the firm’s main British entity, Weybourne Limited, returned £24.2 million in share capital to its Singapore parent company, filings show. It withdrew a further £600 million in December, reversing a transaction between the entities four years ago that a Dyson representative previously told Bloomberg helped improve governance structures. Separately, under plans disclosed publicly in late 2024, a Weybourne property firm based in Britain closed in December after transferring ownership of its real estate investments to a Singapore entity in a £26.4 million transaction. Another property firm in Britain named after Mr Dyson’s Gloucestershire estate, Dodington Park, closed in 2025 after similarly transferring its real estate investments to the billionaire’s namesake farming business. That inflow for Dyson Farming achieved “operational efficiencies”, Weybourne Limited said in its 2024 accounts filed in October, underscoring the benefits of corporate housekeeping across the British billionaire’s empire. Mr Dyson is lining up a further diversification of his fortune, which remains mostly tied up in his technology company, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. In 2025, his vacuum maker committed to boosting its annual dividends to the billionaire’s Singapore-based Weybourne Holdings to £225 million, reversing a recent trend of declining payouts. It previously paid a £200 million dividend for 2024, its lowest total in at least seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While there has been a global boom over the past two decades in the number of family investment firms catering to the needs of the world’s ultra-rich, few are as large as Weybourne. Created in 2013, it now has more than 70 employees across teams in London and Singapore, where it set up an insurance unit three years ago to help protect Dyson’s financial affairs and has recently sought to hire staff. Weybourne last publicly disclosed net assets in the UK of £4.5 billion in 2019, when the technology firm Mr Dyson founded more than two decades ago said it was relocating its headquarters to Singapore. Its other recent job openings include a UK position on its human resources team, a rare feature among investment firms of the ultra-wealthy. “It keeps a lot in-house that peers outsource,” said Mr Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices. “Weybourne needs the bodies.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, has appointed financier and former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as Canada's ambassador to the US, ahead of major trade talks with the Trump administration. Wiseman, an experienced investment manager, takes on the task as Canada works to reset its strained relations with the US while preparing for a tense review of the current free trade deal. His appointment follows current ambassador Kirsten Hillman's announcement that she would be ending her tenure in Washington. Carney said Wiseman "brings immense experience, extensive contacts and deep commitment" to the post at a "crucial time of transformation" for Canada and the US. "As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions, while building opportunities for both Canada and the United States," the prime minister said in a statement on Monday. The new ambassador is set to take on the role in mid-February, Carney added. Wiseman, 55, reportedly a close friend of Carney's, is currently a senior advisor and chairman of Canada at Lazard, a financial services company, and a senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy firm. In March, Carney added him as a member of the prime minister's council on Canada-US relations, a group formed to navigate the currently turbulent bilateral relationship. The Yale alumni also previously worked in both New York and Paris as a lawyer with law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is one of the co-founders of the Century Initiative, a charitable organisation that has lobbied for increased immigration levels in Canada, with the goal reaching 100 million people in the country by 2100 to support economic growth. The role with Century Initiative stirred up criticism ahead of his appointment. Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has accused Wiseman of being "someone who proposed a policy that inflates the cost of living, takes away jobs and puts pressure on our health care system". "Why does the Prime Minister want to appoint him as ambassador to Washington?" Beyond domestic politics, Wiseman will face the currently thorny relationship between the US and Canada while in Washington. Trump halted trade talks with Canada in late October in anger over an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province of Ontario and aired in the US. Trump has imposed sector-specific tariffs on Canadian metals, lumber and automotives. He has also imposed a sweeping tariff rate of 35% on all goods, though most have been exempt under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) - known at the USMCA in the US - trade pact. A scheduled review of CUSMA is now underway, starting with public hearings and stakeholder consultations, after which Canada, the US and Mexico could agree to renew it, or let it expire. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency for parts of California, including Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego.

Terms of North American free trade deal set to be renegotiated in 2026 under shadow of US tariff policies. By News Agencies Share Save Canada has named former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as the new ambassador to the United States, with upcoming trade and tariff negotiations likely to dominate his tenure. In a statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Wiseman would help manage Canada’s relationship with the US, which has grown stormy under tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. “Mr Wiseman will be a key contributor to the government’s efforts to advance Canada-US priorities, including secure borders [and] a strengthened trade and investment relationship,” Carney said in a statement. Relations between the countries have somewhat settled after the US launched a trade war targeting Canadian goods, prompting anger at what was widely viewed as an act of economic hostility against a longtime ally. The Trump administration has targeted Canada with several rounds of tariffs, including a blanket 25 percent tariff for allegedly failing to stem migration and fentanyl flows from Canada. That came despite data showing only a tiny fraction of fentanyl smuggled into the US crosses the US-Canada border. The US subsequently imposed sweeping tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminium imports, all of which disproportionately affected Canada. In August, Trump and Carney, who was elected on a promise to take a tough stance in the face of US threats, reached agreements to roll back some of the measures. A more comprehensive deal has remained elusive. Trump has also stirred anger by repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st US state, which Carney has firmly rejected. Those tensions could re-emerge in the coming months as officials set out to renegotiate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, also known as the USMCA. Canadian officials are set to begin discussions with US counterparts in mid-January on the USMCA, which currently exempts many key products that would otherwise be tariffed under Trump’s policies. Canada is the top export destination for 36 US states, with nearly $2.7bn worth of goods and services crossing the border each day. Carney has hedged his expectations for the future of trade relations with the US, saying that Canada will defend its economic interests but that US policy is beyond its control.

Title: Trump Loses GOP Support on China Policy

Donald Trump is wrecking so much with his blend of impulsivity and personal graft and vanity that it is sometimes hard to distinguish the consequential from the incidental. Far more important than his plastering his name everywhere is Trump’s incoherent China policy, where he keeps raising and lowering tariffs to no strategic purpose while at the same time giving away crown jewels or finding a way to sell them. More from Robert Kuttner Earlier this month, there was widespread outrage in the defense community when Trump reversed policy and allowed Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, its second most advanced artificial intelligence chip. Seven Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a letter warning that “the President’s dangerous decision to give away crucial national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities.” The decision to allow the sale followed months of courtship and flattery of Trump by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Nvidia used a brand-new tech conference in D.C. to lavish praise on Trump, and Huang gave generously to Trump’s ballroom project and has claimed that Trump is ushering in a new Industrial Revolution (his words) with AI. The H200 decision came right after an Oval Office meeting between Huang and Trump. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In line with Trump’s habit of asking private companies to pay tribute, Nvidia will kick back 25 percent “revenue share” of the value of its China sales to the U.S. government. This doesn’t go directly into Trump’s pocket. But in the great favor bank, Trump will find ways to cash in this favor to Huang for his personal enrichment. Now, however, Congress has pushed back big-time. In the annual defense authorization bill that Trump has just signed into law, a broad bipartisan coalition inserted provisions codifying a 2023 Biden executive order requiring national-security screening of outbound U.S. capital investment in China. In past years, U.S. venture capital firms have supplied a lot of the funds for AI development in China. Funds managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have major investments in China’s marquee tech company, Alibaba. The authorization bill does not reverse the Nvidia chip approval, but it sends a shot across Trump’s bow and signals more willingness of Republicans to defect from automatic support for Trump. In supporting the new restrictions, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned, “Every dollar invested in China by a United States investor into a Chinese company is a dollar that’s going toward the potential production of weapons and technology that one day may be used to kill Americans.” Congress needs to go further and ban sweetheart deals like the Nvidia waiver. Meanwhile, Trump is pulling back on technologies where China increasingly dominates, such as EVs and renewable energy. His treatment of the Caribbean as an American lake and Ukraine as part of greater Russia is a virtual invitation for China to invade Taiwan. While Trump is obsessed with Venezuela as a national-security threat and imposes vanity tariffs on friendly nations like Canada that fall short of his standards of genuflection, militarily and commercially he is letting China clean America’s clock.

BlackRock named its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) one of the top three investment themes for 2025, a striking move given bitcoin’s BTC$87,806.39 slide this year. The firm placed IBIT alongside two more traditional offerings: the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT). Bitcoin has dropped more than 4% year-to-date, the first decline in three years, and IBIT has mirrored that performance. Even so, the ETF has seen strong investor interest. IBIT ranks sixth among all ETFs by 2025 inflows, pulling in over $25 billion since January. “It's easy to frame this as BlackRock simply promoting its highest-revenue product,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “But I see it more as the firm doubling down on its conviction that bitcoin belongs in diversified portfolios.” Geraci noted that BlackRock has other ETFs, like the gold-focused IAU, that are outperforming IBIT and charge higher fees. Yet the firm is spotlighting a product that underperformed in 2025, a rare move in an industry that typically pushes its top-performing funds. “If the objective were purely revenue generation, BlackRock has no shortage of ETFs with significantly higher fees that it could emphasize instead,” he said. “Asset managers aren’t typically in the business of spotlighting underperforming products, particularly when they have a deep bench of outperforming alternatives they could highlight.” The inclusion of IBIT as a top 2025 theme signals a long-term bet on the crypto asset by the world’s largest asset manager. For investors who still see crypto as speculative or fringe, BlackRock’s positioning of bitcoin alongside cash and stocks may shift that perception.

Title: Real Estate ETF Poised For Breakout As Treasury Yields Drop And Cap Rates Compress

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLRE) has spent 2025 in the penalty box and looks poised to close the year… exactly where it started. That underperformance may be setting up a contrarian opportunity that makes 2026 explosive. The fund tracks real estate investment trusts as the sector transitions from defensive survival mode to offensive expansion. The biggest macro factor for XLRE in 2026 is the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory. According to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)’s iShares outlook, the most likely path brings rates down as the Fed continues its monetary policy adjustments. That matters because real estate operates on spreads. When Treasury yields decline while REIT dividends hold steady or grow, real estate becomes more attractive on a relative basis. The mechanism is cap rate compression. As borrowing costs decline, property valuations rise because the same income stream gets divided by a lower discount rate. Industry data shows cap rates already declining in late 2025, with further drops expected in 2026 as financial pressures ease. This is the mathematical reality of how real estate gets priced. Investors should monitor the Federal Reserve’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections and monthly Treasury yield movements. When Treasury yields decline, that signals XLRE’s relative attractiveness is improving. XLRE’s micro story is its exposure to secular growth infrastructure. The fund holds positions in data center and cell tower REITs, including Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR). Equinix is among the top holdings showing positive earnings growth, while its peers saw earnings compress. Analysts project significant upside for Equinix and the most bullish outlook among major XLRE components. This matters because AI infrastructure spending isn’t slowing. Data centers and cell towers generate contractual income with built-in escalators, making them more predictable than traditional real estate. As interest rates decline, these high-quality assets should see valuation expansion first. Check XLRE’s monthly holdings updates on the State Street website to track shifts in data center exposure. Quarterly earnings from Equinix and Digital Realty, typically released in February, May, August, and November, provide early signals on demand trends. The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) offers similar real estate exposure with a slightly lower expense ratio and broader diversification across smaller REITs. It provides comparable income with less concentration risk in the top 10 holdings. For 2026, watch the Fed’s rate path and XLRE’s data center holdings. Those two factors will determine whether this year’s underperformance becomes next year’s breakout. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: 2026 Looks Like An Inflection Point For Schwab’s US REIT To Launch Higher | SCHH

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © VideoFlow / Shutterstock.com The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHH) has spent the last year treading water, down roughly 2% while investors waited for interest rates to cooperate. With the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.2% in mid-December and the Federal Reserve signaling a gradual path toward lower rates in 2026, SCHH sits at the inflection point where real estate transforms from defensive survival mode to offensive expansion. The single biggest macro force shaping SCHH’s 2026 trajectory is the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield. Real estate investment trusts compete directly with risk-free government bonds for income-seeking capital. When Treasuries yield 4% or more, a REIT paying 3.5% looks unattractive. But if rates drift toward the 3.0% to 3.5% range that BlackRock and other forecasters expect by late 2026, that same REIT dividend becomes compelling. Lower long-term rates trigger cap rate compression. Property values move inversely to interest rates because the discount rate used to value future cash flows declines. A warehouse generating steady rental income becomes worth more when buyers can finance acquisitions at 4% instead of 6%. For SCHH, which holds industrial REITs like Prologis (NYSE:PLD) at nearly 9% of the portfolio, this valuation lift flows directly through to net asset value. The commercial real estate maturity wall is equally critical. Roughly $162 billion in CRE loans mature in 2026, up 56% from 2025’s $104 billion. Much of this debt was originated at 3% to 4% rates and needs refinancing. If rates stay elevated near 6%, refinancing becomes punishing and dividends get cut. If rates fall toward 4%, the crisis becomes manageable. SCHH’s fate hinges on this refinancing environment because its holdings must either roll over debt or tap equity markets at reasonable costs. Beyond macro rates, SCHH’s micro story centers on sector allocation within its 165 holdings. The fund’s largest position, Welltower (NYSE:WELL) at 9.84%, has surged over 50% year-to-date, demonstrating that healthcare REITs can thrive even in tough rate environments due to demographic tailwinds. But data center REITs like Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR), representing 4.1% of SCHH, have fallen 14% this year as AI infrastructure euphoria faded and financing costs bit harder. This divergence matters because SCHH’s 2026 performance depends on which subsectors catch momentum. Infrastructure REITs including cell towers and data centers comprise roughly 18% of the portfolio. Industrial and logistics properties add another 15%. Residential REITs account for 12%. The Fidelity MSCI Real Estate Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FREL) offers a similar portfolio at an expense ratio of 0.084% versus SCHH’s 0.07%. FREL holds $1.1 billion in assets with nearly identical top holdings including Welltower, Prologis, and American Tower. The key difference is FREL includes real estate services companies like CBRE Group (NYSE:CBRE) at 3.26% and CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) at 1.98%, which aren’t REITs but benefit from real estate transaction volumes. If the rate environment improves and property sales accelerate in 2026, FREL captures that upside through its services exposure while SCHH remains pure-play property ownership. The most important signal for SCHH over the next 12 months is whether the 10-year Treasury yield breaks below 4% and stays there, combined with whether the fund’s industrial and healthcare REIT holdings maintain occupancy and rental growth despite the refinancing wave.

Title: Monthly Pay ETFs Go Mainstream And Retirees LOVE Them

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St I opened the conversation by admitting something most investors eventually confront. There are products in the market that sound intriguing, but you are not entirely sure how they work. Monthly pay ETFs fall squarely into that category for many people. Lee stepped in to explain why they have quietly become one of the most useful income tools available today. Lee started with the basics. Exchange traded funds trade intraday, unlike traditional open-end mutual funds that settle at the end of the day. What surprised many income investors over the past decade is that while most ETFs originally paid dividends quarterly, a growing group now pays monthly. For retirees, boomers, and older Gen X investors, that distinction matters far more than it sounds. Lee pointed to JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) Equity Premium Income ETF, symbol JEPI, as the most widely recognized example. With roughly $30 billion in assets, JEPI pays a monthly yield north of 8%. While it does experience some volatility during broader market drawdowns, Lee noted that income-focused investors continue to support it because consistent cash flow is the primary objective. We also discussed more specialized options. One that stood out was the Gabelli Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (NYSE: GGN). Managed by Mario Gabelli’s firm, it holds a mix of gold and energy stocks, effectively pairing two sectors that often perform well during inflationary or volatile environments. GGN pays a monthly dividend above 8%, making it attractive for investors who want sector exposure alongside income. Another higher-yield option Lee mentioned was BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II (NYSE: BSTZ), a technology-oriented income fund paying monthly distributions exceeding 11%. These types of funds are not designed for ultra-conservative investors, but for those willing to accept some volatility, the income potential can be compelling. Lee emphasized that monthly pay ETFs are particularly well suited for boomers and Gen X investors nearing retirement. They are not replacements for Treasury bonds or insured products, but they serve as powerful income complements. Even investors who do not currently need the income can reinvest monthly dividends, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. When prices dip, reinvested dividends buy more shares, enhancing long-term income potential. We agreed that monthly pay ETFs are one of the most practical innovations in income investing over the past decade. They combine liquidity, yield, and flexibility in a way traditional dividend stocks and mutual funds often cannot. Whether used to fund living expenses or to compound income over time, they give investors another way to turn portfolios into cash-flow engines. [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there’s something out that I don’t even know how it works, but you do. It’s monthly pay ETFs. Tell me about them, I’m not familiar. [00:00:13] Lee Jackson: Well, everybody is probably pretty familiar with the exchange traded fund now and the way they vary from the old opened end mutual fund, exchange traded funds, trade on the major exchanges and they’re, you can buy and sell ’em anytime during the day when you want, at any price. [00:00:31] It doesn’t matter. Whereas when you wanna sell your Vanguard, open-end mutual fund, you may have to call Vanguard and sell and you’ll get the end of the day price. Yeah. But, one of the things that we found out and I was intrigued by, ’cause I’ve written about dividend and dividend paying stocks at, 24/7 for almost 15 years, is that most of these ETFs paid like mutual funds. [00:00:55] They pay quarterly. But in the last 10, 8, 10 years, they started to have ETFs that paid monthly. And think of that if you’re a boomer, an older, gen X person getting, what Better to supplement your passive income. And remember, passive income is income. that the IRS views, it’s anything from your job. [00:01:19] So if you have stocks or bonds or real estate or things like that that generate income, that’s passive income. Well, some of the really good ones that we like, and one of the biggest ones is it’s got $30 billion in it, is run by JP Morgan and it’s the, symbol on it is JEPI. It pays about an eight 15% yield monthly. [00:01:43] Wow. Monthly and you know it ha has it gone up and down a little bit? Did it go down a little bit, when we had the draw down in late October and November? Yeah, but then it came right back. ’cause who doesn’t want an eight 40 or eight 50, whatever it is, dividend monthly with, I mean, is there risk? Sure, because it is, it’s not a treasury bond yielding 3.8%. [00:02:07] It’s yielding 8.3% or whatever it is. That’s a good one. Another one we like and this is especially interesting if it’s people that are wanting a sector play, is, the Gabelli Gamco trust, symbol. GGN. Yeah. All, it holds is gold stocks. And energy stocks, so that’s almost your perfect Paris trade in one. [00:02:33] You’ve got the red hot gold stocks, which Goldman Sachs thinks exceed 4,900 next year, and then it has all of the quality energy stocks, but it pays monthly. The dividend on GGN is in the eight plus percent range. It’s run by Mario Gabelli’s company. He’s been on wall team for 50 years. So that’s a good shot to take. [00:02:57] Another good one that we like it’s, the symbol is BSTZ and it’s sort of a income related technology play, but the, again, the dividends monthly, it’s about 11.2%. And again, these aren’t for people that are very, very, very conservative. All the JP Morgan one you could go with, it’s, that’s pretty good. Very conservative, really all, and they all use big, they write covered calls on their positions. The stocks go up, they get called away, they replace it with another stock or buy the stock again. But I think for boomers, gen X people that are steering towards retirement, these are the perfect adjuncts to social security, pension funds, IRA distributions, anything like that. every bill that you have to pay for the most part comes monthly. Your car payment or your mortgage payment doesn’t come every quarter, comes every single month. [00:04:01] And what better way to augment income with passive income? And these are good, good ideas and we constantly write about this. So if you keep checking on, 24/7 Wall Street, you’ll see our ideas, I mean, we have so many good writers covering this now, [00:04:18] we probably have 10 guys and gals that are covering the exchange traded fund, income stocks. So they’re a good way to generate money. And, again, if you don’t need the income, if you don’t need the income, you can reinvest your dividends. [00:04:33] Just go to your broker and say, I wanna reinvest these every month. So if, it goes up a little bit and you’re reinvesting, you won’t buy as much. But if it does go down, like the draw down we had in October and November, you’ll buy more shares. So either way, just remember it. It’s like the dream investment for boomers, the monthly pay etf.

‘Tis the season for “biggest story of the year” articles and, when it comes to crypto, the choice in 2025 was not hard. The obvious pick is Wall Street’s full-on embrace of crypto, which saw banks and big companies tripping over each other to show they are down with stablecoins and tokenized assets. But look a little closer and you’ll see 2025 featured another major, but more subtle, trend: the ongoing expansion of DeFi and decentralized technology. This has been reflected in the huge growth of DeFi platforms like Hyperliquid, and in Coinbase’s decision last week to add Jupiter, a leading aggregator for decentralized Solana trading, to its app. Such developments have helped decentralized exchanges nab a bigger share of overall crypto trading volume, with degens now accounting for a double digital share of the spot trading market. The CEO of Maple Finance, one of the leading players in the decentralized space, this week went so far as to claim “DeFi is dead”—implying that on-chain trading has become so big that it is poised to swallow conventional systems altogether. I wouldn’t go that far (at least not for a few years), but you get the point. The CEO’s remark also highlights how, in coming years, we are likely to face confusion over what exactly the term decentralized means. For longtime blockchain enthusiasts, the term implies using blockchain technology to build more democratic alternatives to powerful institutions—including big banks, but also the likes of Google and Facebook. But if this is the promise of crypto, what should we make of JPMorgan and BlackRock launching new on-chain money market funds available to those with $5 million or more to trade?It’s a win, of course, that blockchain technology has proved so good that the most respected names in traditional finance are using it. Still, it’s hard to get excited about giant corporations using blockchains to sling commercial paper when the original goal was to democratize large sections of society and the economy. The situation is reminiscent of the quip: “They promised us flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Coinbase offers stock trading: The company says its move into equities will let it be a bridge to the era of tokenization. Coinbase also launched prediction markets in a tie-up with Kalshi, intensifying its head-to-head competition with Robinhood. (Fortune) Here come the big banks: The country’s eight largest banks are putting tens of millions into a new non-profit that will “tell the banking industry’s story”—a clear response to crypto firms’ mass lobbying efforts, and one that could complicate the push for new blockchain legislation. (Axios) North Korea’s record haul: The Hermit Kingdom’s notorious military-backed hackers out did themselves in 2025, stealing a record $2 billion in crypto—the lion’s share of the estimated $3.4 billion stolen overall. (Fortune) PayPal’s hard path: The fintech giant’s CEO told Fortune his company is facing a “very classic innovator’s dilemma” as it doubles down on crypto and stablecoins to try to keep pace with competitors. (Fortune) Bitcoin OGs still selling: Longtime Bitcoin holders keep off-loading their positions, which helps explain ongoing pressure on prices. The move may not signal a loss of confidence, but rather a sign of the market maturing as one-time HODLers take advantage of new liquidity supplied by ETFs and institutional funds. (Bloomberg) Caroline Ellison is back in the news after the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund was released from federal prison. Her onetime boyfriend, meanwhile, still faces decades of hard time. The feds arrested a Brooklyn man for impersonating a Coinbase staffer in order to steal $16 million from around 100 traders. The suspect’s “lolimfeelingevil” alias probably won’t help at his sentencing hearing.

Share this article BlackRock sent 2,019 Bitcoin worth approximately $182 million and 29,928 Ethereum worth around $91 million to Coinbase Prime on Monday, according to blockchain data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. Markets tend to pay close attention to the firm’s on-chain movements, which frequently are followed by large flows later in the day or in subsequent sessions. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs saw over $240 million in net outflows last week, while its Ethereum funds shed roughly $558 million without a single day of positive flows, per Farside Investors. Crypto investment products lost $952 million in capital last week. The downturn ended a four-week streak of inflows, largely due to $555 million exiting Ethereum funds and $460 million from Bitcoin funds. After dipping below $85,000 late last week, Bitcoin rebounded past $90,000 ahead of today’s US market open. The recovery boosted sentiment across the board, lifting the total crypto market cap by 1.5% to $3.1 trillion in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?
