Client FOMO has forced Vanguard to rethink crypto ETF ban Client demand for crypto ETF access reportedly drove the shift, forcing Vanguard to adapt and open its brokerage platform to third-party products. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Balchunas, it will be positive for the sector. Vanguard, a $10 trillion asset manager, is reportedly planning to offer access to crypto ETFs after distancing itself from the industry since 2024. According to a former Fox Business reporter, Eleanor Terret, the firm is planning to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. The world’s largest mutual fund and second-biggest asset manager will enable access through its brokerage platform. Gerald Gallagher, General Counsel at Sei Labs, confirmed the Vanguard plans, citing a senior insider familiar with the issue. He added that the asset manager had “regrets” and wished they had done it “sooner.” Gallagher noted that the firm will not do original crypto ETF issuance but will offer access to third-party providers due to client demand. By contrast, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the pivot was expected. He previously predicted that the new Vanguard CEO, Salim Ramji, who spearheaded BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF, would accept crypto. He added that it was “smart of them” to end the Bitcoin ETF ban. “Smart of them imo. Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs hugely popular, and Salim (the CEO) was one of IBIT’s midwives, so he knows.” Source: X As of September, BlackRock crypto holdings were worth about $100 billion. Its Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), had over $85B worth of assets at current market prices. Overall, the world’s largest asset manager was earning about $250 million in revenue from its crypto section, surpassing its equity business line. Source: X Fidelity was the second-largest crypto ETF player, with about $25 billion in net crypto assets under management. That being said, the details on Vanguard crypto ETF plans will be known in the near future. But the impact will be positive for the market, added Balchunas. “Vanguard has 50 million investors. Obviously, many are not the bitcoin type, but that’s massive; they are the biggest fund company in the US by two times over.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Analyst Predicts Solana Staking ETFs To Be Approved For Trading Within Two Weeks — Is $300 SOL Next Stop?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/analyst-predicts-solana-staking-etfs-to-be-approved-for-trading-within-two-weeks-is-300-sol-next-stop/

Multiple applications for Solana (SOL) staking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are poised to secure the regulatory nod from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the coming weeks. In a recent post on the X social media platform, Nate Geraci, the president of NovaDius Wealth Management, pointed out that on Friday, asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale Investments, VanEck, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and Fidelity, all submitted revised S-1 registration statements for their spot SOL ETFs to the SEC to clarify details around their staking activity. Fidelity, which manages the second-largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by assets under management, will stake a portion of its SOL holdings to generate yield, according to its updated filing. According to Geraci, this flurry of SOL applications, which include a staking component, is likely to receive US approval by mid-October. “Guessing these are approved w/in next two weeks,” he stated. The ETF analyst further suggested that the inclusion of staking in the SOL filings “bodes well for spot ETH staking.” Notably, BlackRock, which is the undisputed leader of the U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has not yet submitted paperwork to list its own spot SOL fund. REX Shares and Osprey launched the first-ever Solana staking ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange in July after securing automatic approval under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SOL fund attracted $12 million worth of investments in its Wall Street debut and currently boasts assets under management of around $301 million, signaling considerable demand for Solana ETFs. Additionally, Hashdex recently added Solana, Cardano, and Ripple’s XRP to its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, alongside the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) it already held. The regulator also greenlighted a similar multi-crypto fund from Grayscale, giving investors exposure to several assets, including SOL. Solana was trading hands at around $201.61 as of press time, largely flat over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token’s price has fallen 31.2% since hitting its current all-time high of $293.31 in January, not long after the historic introduction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s SOL-based meme coin. With the US SEC approval almost certain, SOL’s path to the coveted $300 milestone heavily relies on capturing significant ETF inflows and maintaining steady accumulation from Solana treasury firms.

Title: Bitcoin Trails Equities, Metals, and USD in Q3. Here Is a Key Level to Watch for Next Move

BTC$111,736.57 just ended what is historically the largest cryptocurrency's third-worst week of the year with a greater-than-average drop of 5%. Week 38 effectively closes out the third quarter, which is up about 1%, as well as September, which has managed to hold flat. While the figures are consistent with the period's historical reputation as one of the weakest seasons of the year, a few catalysts might have contributed to the underperformance. On Friday, more than $17 billion in options expired, with the max pain price — the strike price at which option holders lose the most money and options writers profit the most — sitting at $110,000, which acted as a gravitational center for the spot price. A key technical factor remains the short-term holder cost basis at $110,775, which reflects the average on-chain acquisition price for coins that moved in the past six months. Bitcoin tested this level in August, and in bull markets, it typically moves toward this line multiple times. This year, it broke significantly below that level only once: during the tariff tantrum in April, when it dropped to as low as $74,500. Zooming out, it is important to assess whether bitcoin remains in an uptrend characterized by higher highs and higher lows to get an idea of whether the rally is sustainable. Analyst Caleb Franzen highlights that bitcoin has slipped below its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), with the 200-day EMA sitting at $106,186. The previous significant low was around $107,252 on Sept. 1, and for the broader trend to remain intact, bitcoin will need to hold above that level., The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter, well above the 3.3% estimate and the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2023. Initial jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 218,000, coming in below expectations and marking the lowest level since mid-July. While spending data came in line with the market's expectation. The US core PCE price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying inflation that excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% in August 2025 from the prior month. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries bounced off the 4% support, and is now trading near 4.2%. The dollar index (DXY) continues to hover around long-term support at 98. Meanwhile, metals are leading the action, with silver at around $45 approaching an all-time high at levels last seen in 1980 and 2011. U.S. equities, in the meantime, are just shy of their records. Bitcoin remains the outlier at more than 10% below its peak. Bitcoin treasury companies continue to face severe multiple-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) compression. Strategy (MSTR) is barely positive year-to-date. At one point, it dipped below $300, a negative return for 2025. The ratio between Strategy and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stands at 4.8, the lowest since October 2024, which shows just how much the largest bitcoin treasury company has underperformed bitcoin over the past 12 months. Strategy’s enterprise mNAV is currently 1.44 (as of Friday). Enterprise value here accounts for all basic shares outstanding, total notional debt and total notional value of perpetual preferred stock minus the company’s cash balance. The silver lining for MSTR is that three of the four perpetual preferred stocks, STRK, STRC and STRF, are all sporting positive lifetime returns as Executive Chairman Michael Saylor looks to buy more BTC through these vehicles. A growing issue for MSTR is the lack of volatility in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's Implied volatility — a measure of the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations — has dropped below 40, the lowest in years. This matters because Saylor has often framed MSTR as a volatility play on bitcoin. For comparison, MSTR’s implied volatility is at 68. Its annualized standard deviation of daily log returns over the past year was 89%, while over the last 30 days it has fallen to 49%. For equities, higher volatility often attracts speculators, generates trading opportunities and draws investor attention, so the decline is likely acting as a headwind. Meantime, the fifth-largest bitcoin treasury company, Metaplanet (3350), holds 25,555 BTC and still has roughly $500 million left to deploy from its international offering. Despite this, its share price continues to struggle at 517 yen ($3.45), more than 70% below its all-time high. Metaplanet’s mNAV has dropped to 1.12, down sharply from 8.44 in June. Its market capitalization now stands at $3.94 billion compared to a bitcoin NAV of $2.9 billion, with an average BTC acquisition cost of $106,065.

Title: Crypto’s Quiet Mainstreaming This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexlazarow/2025/09/27/cryptos-quiet-mainstreaming-this-year/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T17:21:00Z

ByAlex Lazarow, Senior Contributor. For years, the crypto headlines have vacillated between hype (coin X is breaking out!) and gloom (but limited real-world adoption is nil). Quietly, the industry has migrated from speculation, into becoming the real plumbing of global finance. In this piece, I wanted to highlight three key developments that are harbingers of change to come. BlackRock already has a tokenized U.S. treasury vehicle with over $1b in assets. This makes it the largest tokenized firm of its kind. But to me, that’s not the big news. Blackrock is reportedly looking to tokenize its ETFs. This would change how ETFs are traded. It would allow them to be traded 24/7 – and represent an explosion in relevant assets. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was blunt: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing.” Robinhood is making similar moves, launching both tokenized versions of stocks and ETFs over the summer. Interestingly, it includes those of private companies like OpenAI or SpaceX. The market for tokenized assets already grew 85% last year to $15 billion (excluding stablecoins). McKinsey estimates tokenized markets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The World Economic Forum projects tokenization could represent 10% of global GDP as soon as 2027. Tokenization is moving from fringe experimentation, into a likely mainstay of some of the world’s largest asset managers. Stablecoins represent more than $250 billion in value today. More than 500 million wallets now hold stablecoins, with emerging markets driving much of that growth. While in the past crypto wallets were for speculation, many use cases today are mainstay financial services across treasury, settlements, cross-border payments. For corporates, they enable instant settlement with transparency. For banks, they radically reduce counterparty risk. For investors, they provide stability in volatile markets. And for consumers in emerging markets, stablecoins offer a way to escape currency depreciation. In countries like Argentina, Nigeria, and Turkey, inflation and currency volatility erode savings. Apps like Dollar App are building on top of stablecoins to allow users to save and spend in US dollars. Fintechs And Central Banks Are Building Their Own Rails Making headlines of course are fintech players. For example, Stripe is incubating Tempo, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed for payments. Its design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Shopify, Revolut, Nubank, DoorDash, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Stripe has also spent over a billion dollars acquiring stablecoin infrastructure — including its $1.1 billion acquisition of Bridge (Fintech Futures). Circle, Visa, and others are experimenting with proprietary blockchains to reduce costs and accelerate settlement. More quietly, but likely far more transformative are central bank actions. One hundred and thirty-seven countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are now exploring central bank digital currencies. Seventy-two are in advanced development or pilot stages. In Nigeria, the eNaira doubled to 10 million active users in 2024. In India, the e-rupee in circulation grew 334% in a year, exceeding $120 million by Q1 2025. As governments adopt digital money, banks, fintechs and corporates will likely follow. Whereas much of this innovation was once the viewed as fantasy, it is increasingly becoming mainstream. The U.S. passed the Genius act. Europe passed the MiCA framework for digital assets. But it has happened slowly and now seemingly all at once.

Title: Are Whales and Institutional Players Still Bullish on Bitcoin? — Here’s What Market Data Says‬

Large investors and institutional players are quietly increasing their Bitcoin exposure, even as the broader market remains stagnant. New data from the Coinbase Premium Index reveals that the measure has remained positive since April, indicating that U.S. institutions and whale accounts on Coinbase Pro continue to purchase at a faster pace than retail traders elsewhere. The index, which tracks price differences between Coinbase and exchanges such as Binance, has long been seen as a barometer for institutional demand. The momentum is closely tied to the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Coinbase acts as both a custody and pricing partner for several of the funds, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, meaning ETF inflows are now directly reflected in this institutional premium. On-chain analyst Darkfost noted the trend on X, stressing that “whales and institutions are still accumulating BTC today.” He cautioned, however, that past cycles show how quickly sentiment can turn if euphoria builds unchecked. The Federal Reserve’s latest quarter-point rate cut appears to have sparked additional activity. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin open interest on Binance increased by 4.7% in the 24 hours following the decision, rising from $12.8 billion to $13.4 billion. Given Binance’s outsized share of global derivatives trading, analysts say the increase is a reliable signal of renewed appetite among high-volume traders. Many cryptocurrencies typically gain momentum during easing cycles since lower rates encourage risk-taking. The surge in open interest suggests that institutional traders are anticipating potential upside, complementing the steady accumulation already evident on Coinbase. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin commands a 57.1% share of the total cryptocurrency market, with an overall capitalization of $4.04 trillion at the time of writing. These figures are supported by a balanced market sentiment, even as whales expand their holdings. Whether that institutional support will be enough to push Bitcoin through resistance in the weeks ahead may depend less on short-term sentiment and more on how investors digest the Fed’s policy path.

Title: Regulators weigh billion-dollar utility takeovers as bills rise for consumers

Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. RELATED STORY | As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy" and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. About Scripps News

Title: How Ripple’s XRP Can Help Address The Global Debt Crisis, According To Black Swan Capitalist Founder

The founder of Black Swan Capitalist believes that XRP, which spent years fighting the US Securities and Exchange Commission in court, could play a pivotal role in solving the global debt crisis by restructuring the financial system. Black Swan Capitalist founder Versan Aljarrah took to the X social media platform to suggest that global debt cannot be repaid under current conditions and must first be restructured. The real solution, in his opinion, involves converting trillions into tokenized liquidity running on neutral assets such as Ripple-affiliated XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins. Global debt can't be paid back. It has to be restructured.The real play is converting trillions into tokenized liquidity running on neutral assets like XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins.Cycles reward those who prepare before the narrative, not after. pic.twitter.com/pEYIswQ9jd “Trillions in debt will be tokenized,” he asserted in a different post. “But only XRP can unlock the liquidity trapped inside.” Aljarrah’s remarks come as large swaths of institutions increasingly experiment with the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain rails in the new era of programmable finance. Tokenization of RWAs is the process of converting ownership or rights to physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger. This strategy leverages blockchain technology to convert tangible assets such as real estate, artwork, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens that can be conveniently bought, sold, and traded on-chain. These talks of XRP unlocking debt liquidity follow a report from the International Monetary Fund revealing that global debt currently stands at around $250 trillion (or 235% of GDP). An increase in public borrowing to nearly $100 trillion last year helped offset reductions in private sector debt. These figures underscore how tokenized liquidity could prove key in easing the overwhelming debt burden. Ripple is gaining traction in the burgeoning tokenization sector. DBS, Franklin Templeton, and Ripple have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on offering trading and lending solutions that leverage tokenized money market funds on the XRP Ledger blockchain and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Moreover, the $740.4 million RLUSD stablecoin was recently integrated into a new smart contract on Securitize’s platform as an off-ramp option for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized money-market funds.

Title: Best Altcoins to Buy After Vanguard’s Big Crypto ETF Shift

Time Published: 2025-09-27T10:27:28Z

Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund management company, has long stood firm on its old-fashioned anti-crypto stance. Back in January 2024, the company stated it would not offer cryptocurrency exposure to its clients, arguing that the assets were too volatile and incapable of generating sustainable long-term returns. This shift comes in response to strong client demand and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment around the crypto industry. Unlike BlackRock, which has launched its own crypto ETF, Vanguard has no immediate plans to roll out a fund of its own. Instead, its first step would be to allow clients access to third-party crypto ETFs. Read on as we uncover more about Vanguard’s future plans, as well as highlight the best altcoins to buy right now. Although Vanguard has openly criticized cryptocurrencies, it also happens to be the largest shareholder in Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR). Today, Strategy is hands down the largest corporate accumulator of Bitcoin, with 639,835 tokens in its kitty. Vanguard itself owns 20M shares in MicroStrategy, representing around 8% ownership. Adding to this, Vanguard appointed Salim Ramji as its CEO in July 2024. With 25 years of industry experience, Ramji was instrumental in launching BlackRock’s iBIT spot Bitcoin ETF while leading the firm’s global ETF business. His appointment was widely viewed as a signal that Vanguard might eventually pivot toward a more crypto-friendly stance. However, in August, the new CEO clarified that Vanguard had no immediate plans to launch any crypto ETFs. Still, while the company has shied away from direct crypto investment vehicles, there have always been subtle hints pointing in the opposite direction. With competitors like BlackRock leading the charge, Vanguard’s rigidity risks alienating pro-crypto investors. Perhaps that’s what has sparked its recent shift in mindset. With Vanguard finally stepping onto the crypto ship, there couldn’t be a better time to start building your own crypto portfolio. But simply stacking blue-chip digital assets won’t be enough; you’ll need to spot and invest in promising low-cap coins early. Here are our top 3 suggestions. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the first-ever Layer 2 solution for the Bitcoin blockchain designed to solve issues of Web3 compatibility, speed, and scalability. While Bitcoin is the face of the crypto industry, it still lags behind when it comes to innovation and adaptability. For example, Bitcoin can still only process around 7 transactions per second with a block time of 10 minutes. By contrast, Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin Hyper addresses this gap by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), aka the same technology that powers Solana’s high throughput. This integration allows developers to build dApps and execute smart contracts directly on Bitcoin. The SVM uses parallel execution, meaning it can process multiple transactions simultaneously as long as they’re not related. While these transactions occur off-chain, you won’t have to compromise Bitcoin’s renowned Layer 1 security. Supporting this is a non-custodial canonical bridge that locks up your Layer 1 Bitcoin and mints an equivalent amount of Web3-compatible Layer 2 tokens. This utility-driven approach has already helped the $HYPER presale raise $18.5M. At present, 1 $HYPER costs just $0.012985, and based on our $HYPER price prediction, the token could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025, representing a potential 2,364% return. Interested? Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s official website to learn more about this new cryptocurrency project. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers a new content creation and sharing platform aiming to disrupt the $85B industry with innovation and transparency. Imagine spending hours conceptualizing, planning, shooting, and editing a piece of content, only for the platform to take 70% of your revenue in the name of platform and management fees. Infuriating, right? That’s why many content creators are shifting to SUBBD, which charges only a fraction of creators’ earnings as fees. In return, it offers a full suite of AI tools – voice generators, text, image, and video creators – to help produce engaging content. This frees up more time for creators to interact directly with fans and build loyal communities. But it’s not just creators who benefit from SUBBD. Holders of the $SUBBD token can access premium content, subscribe to their favorite creators, request personalized videos, and even send tips as tokens of appreciation. The $SUBBD presale is live and has already pulled in over $1.2M, with each token available for just $0.05652. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD. According to our $SUBBD price prediction, it could surge to $0.301 by the end of 2025, delivering a staggering 432% return on investment. For more details, check out SUBBD Token’s official website. MemeCore ($M) is an innovative Layer-1 blockchain that aims to change how investors perceive meme coins today. Even the best meme coins are often seen merely as fun, speculative assets – entertainment-driven cryptocurrencies that thrive on virality and on-chain activity with little to no utility. MemeCore challenges this by introducing a unique Proof-of-Meme (PoM) mechanism, built on the belief that every on-chain activity strengthens the network. It records and rewards all forms of participation, whether it’s creating and sharing memes, staking, or trading tokens. $M serves as the platform’s native currency, powering all on-chain transactions, gas fees, and reward distributions. On the technical front, MemeCore ($M) gave a strong breakout on September 4 when it broke past its long-term resistance at $1. After hitting an all-time high of $2.96 on September 18, the token is now trading at $2.33 with strong support at $2.12. While the broader crypto market pauses for breath, MemeCore too is consolidating nicely between $3 and $2.12. A breakout above its previous high could propel the token to a new peak of $4 in the coming weeks. Want in? Buy $M on BingX or any of the other crypto exchanges.

Title: 8 Years In Hiding—Now $3 Billion In Ether Comes Alive

A major Ethereum holder that had been quiet for years suddenly moved roughly 200,000 ETH Friday, worth about $800 million at current prices. Based on reports from on-chain trackers, the investor controls a total of 736,316 ETH spread across eight wallets — holdings that are now valued nearly $3 billion. The activity caught attention because several of those addresses had been inactive for years, making this one of the more notable returns by an early-era holder. According to blockchain observers, the transferred coins were not sent to trading venues. Instead, the funds were directed into new addresses tied to staking services, including Ethereum’s Plasma infrastructure, where assets can earn yield while remaining locked. Two wallets that have been dormant for over 8 years just woke up and moved 200K $ETH($785M) to 2 new addresses. This Ethereum OG originally sourced their $ETH primarily from #Bitfinex, currently holds a total of 736,316 $ETH($2.89B) across 8 wallets. Wallets:… pic.twitter.com/wVFzXZcL0o — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 26, 2025 Emmett Gallic, an analyst who flagged the movement, described the action as “bullish.” The choice to stake rather than sell has been noted by market watchers as a possible signal of long-term confidence in Ethereum’s prospects. Reports have disclosed that much of the ETH came from Bitfinex and mining pools active around 2017. Some of the wallets had last moved funds about four years ago; others had been dormant for over eight years. At the time those coins were last active, their combined worth was about $30 million. That figure contrasts sharply with today’s value, which approaches $3 billion, highlighting how much the asset has changed hands in value even for those who stayed put. Ethereum’s price was under stress when the whale reappeared. Based on market data, ETH dipped to $3,829 today, a low not seen since August. Reports show institutional vehicles have been selling recently: ETFs recorded roughly $547 million in outflows over four consecutive days earlier this week. On Thursday, all ETFs logged net outflows except BlackRock, which posted neither inflows nor outflows that day. That said, BlackRock had sold close to $27 million worth of ETH the previous day. These moves appear to have helped push the price lower ahead of the whale’s action. Analysts have pointed out that a large transfer like this would normally stoke fears of a liquidation. In this case, the absence of exchange deposits seemed to calm some traders. Staking shifts coins off liquid markets and can reduce immediate sell pressure. Still, the broader sell-off from ETF products has been sizable and may keep acting as a drag on price until flows stabilize.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: $10 Trillion Asset Manager Vanguard Prepares To Offer Access To Crypto ETFs For The First Time

One of the world’s largest asset managers, Vanguard, is reportedly preparing to enter the digital asset space by offering access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time. This move comes after a period of skepticism from the firm, which manages approximately $10 trillion in assets. According to a Friday report from Crypto in America, a source familiar with Vanguard’s plans has disclosed that the company has begun laying the groundwork for this initiative due to increasing client demand for digital assets and a more favorable regulatory environment. While Vanguard is not planning to launch its own crypto products, as competitors like BlackRock have done, it is reportedly considering granting brokerage customers access to select third-party crypto ETFs. However, the timeline for this decision remains uncertain. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source remarked, highlighting the cautious yet adaptive strategy Vanguard is adopting in response to evolving market conditions. Vanguard’s plans come as under President Donald Trump’s administration, regulatory agencies have significantly shifted their approach toward crypto assets, led by the SEC’s drop of enforcement cases, new frameworks for the growth and adoption of crypto assets and related products. The SEC’s recent approval of a new generic listing standard is expected to expedite the approval process for crypto ETFs, alongside the greenlighting of index funds that include leading crypto assets, further contributing to renewed stances from asset managers like Vanguard. Vanguard’s CEO, Salim Ramji, who previously spent a decade at BlackRock overseeing the successful launch of its Bitcoin ETF, has been at the forefront of this strategy. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has attracted over $60 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024, amassing more than $80 billion in assets. Since taking the helm at Vanguard last year, Ramji’s leadership style has been closely watched, with many speculating whether he might emulate strategies from his former boss, Larry Fink. In January of last year, Vanguard had publicly stated that “Spot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,” dismissing the notion of offering crypto-related products. This decision led some users to threaten account closures due to dissatisfaction with Vanguard’s stance on digital assets. At the July Morningstar Investment Conference, Ramji reiterated that the asset management firm would not replicate competitors by launching its own crypto ETFs. However, he avoided directly addressing the possibility of offering access to third-party crypto ETFs. Yet, as the performance of crypto ETFs has significantly improved over the past year, the firm’s views appear to be evolving, in line with broader market trends and regulatory shifts that are fostering a new era for digital assets.

Title: Anti-Bitcoin Investment Giant Vanguard Reportedly Considering Crypto ETF Access For Customers In Dramatic U-Turn

Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), is reportedly reconsidering its stance on offering its clientele access to such investment vehicles. According to a Sept. 26 report from Crypto in America, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, Vanguard is now examining ways to satisfy customer demand for digital assets amid the evolving regulatory environment. Notably, Vanguard does not intend to introduce its own products. Instead, the famously anti-Bitcoin investment manager is exploring whether to give clients access to third-party crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform, even as its biggest competitor, BlackRock, launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF in history to achieve the $80 billion assets under management record. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source reportedly stated. Vanguard staunchly indicated that it wouldn’t offer its clients trading access to any of the dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that went live on US exchanges in January 2024, citing the crypto’s high volatility as bad for generating long-term returns. The company in July last year named Salim Ramji, the pro-crypto ex-BlackRock exec, to take the reins from his predecessor CEO Tim Buckley, leading to speculation of a reversal of the decision to shun BTC ETFs. However, Ramji poured water on the idea that he had any intentions for the asset management giant to change its approach to crypto funds. “Vanguard is looking to end Bitcoin ETF ban (aka bend the knee lol),” Bloomberg Senior’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed on X. “We heard chatter of this too. Smart of them imo. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are hugely popular and Salim was one of IBIT’s midwives so he knows.” <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Vanguard is looking to end bitcoin ETF ban (aka bend the knee lol). &quot;The dynamics have been changing&quot; Nice scoop by Eleanor. We heard chatter of this too. Smart of them imo.

Obv many are not the bitcoin type but that’s massive, they are biggest fund company in the US by two times over,” Balchunas added. Bitcoin fell below $109,000 yesterday, marking its weakest price in almost a month. The premier crypto has since reclaimed the $110,000 psychological threshold, but it remains to be seen whether the rebound is sustainable.

Title: AI's energy demand draws investment firms to local utilities

(Brooks Johnson/Star Tribune via AP) People leave the The BlackRock investment company in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York, Tuesday, March 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI. Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines. “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds. Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said. BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.” “We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said. In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co. Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone. However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share. Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power. Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies. Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes. “It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources. The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers. Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock. On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills. In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates. In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years. However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs. It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock. In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns. They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations. That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say. Big players on both sides The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them. Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock. On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills. In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates. In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040. Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years. However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs. Skepticism from regulators It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock. In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns. They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.” ___ Follow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Title: BlackRock Exec Pressed On XRP ETF: His Answer Raises More Questions
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-exec-xrp-etf-answer-more-questions/
Time Published: 2025-09-27T01:00:31Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, was pressed on the prospect of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund during an interview with Nate Geraci on the “Crypto Prime” podcast. While he offered no product reveal, he did spell out precisely how BlackRock is thinking about what could come next after its blockbuster Bitcoin and Ether launches. Geraci noted on air that he has “publicly predicted that BlackRock would file for a spot XRP ETF and a spot Solana ETF,” then asked how the firm evaluates “future product development around crypto-related ETFs.” Mitchnick declined to speak to any specific tickers but was explicit about the decision framework: “There’s a lot of factors that go into that decision-making process obviously, but the biggest driver ultimately is our clients… What is the level of investor demand? What is the logic and investment thesis for investors and for our clients around these potential products? What problem are we solving for them?” He added that BlackRock weighs “market cap, liquidity, [and] maturity,” along with “clarity of investment thesis and overall… portfolio considerations,” describing it as “a constant evaluation process,” not a single point in time. The exchange came amid a wide-ranging discussion of how quickly BlackRock’s crypto business has scaled and how starkly the firm differentiates Bitcoin from Ether in client portfolios. My conversation w/ BlackRock’s @robbiemitchnick… We discuss: -Massive success of IBIT & ETHA -Btc & eth in broader portfolio -Staking in spot eth ETFs -Generic listing standards -Crypto ETF development -Tokenization -Stablecoinshttps://t.co/54NgVDFpVJ via @CryptoPrimePod pic.twitter.com/N5H4EnI7Q7 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) September 25, 2025 Geraci highlighted the growth figures—“[IBIT] launched in early January 2024. It’s over $85 billion in assets… [ETHA] launched in July… around $16 billion”—and asked whether Ethereum’s trajectory matched expectations after Bitcoin’s record start. Mitchnick pushed back on early narratives that Ether ETFs were a “bust” only because they were “being compared against the extraordinary record-setting numbers” of Bitcoin, pointing out that ETHA became “the third fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion.” Mitchnick drew a bright line between the two assets from a portfolio-construction perspective. Bitcoin, he said, functions for many allocators as “this sort of digital gold type instrument,” a “global scarce decentralized non-sovereign asset” with distinct risk and return drivers. Ethereum is “a more nuanced, more technical discussion,” effectively “a bet around blockchain adoption and digital assets more broadly,” with competitive dynamics and questions about “value capture in the Ether token versus the activity level on the Ethereum blockchain.” As a result, Bitcoin has seen “much greater penetration” among institutional and wealth advisory channels, while Ether ownership remains “overwhelmingly” in the direct investor segment. On the gating factors that could unlock the next wave of demand, Mitchnick said it is “still early days” for both institutions and wealth platforms in the United States. Many large firms allow execution-only access, but “the vast majority of advisers… still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” He described “various stages of approving this” across the wirehouses, including one firm “starting to put it in model portfolios,” and noted that BlackRock’s own model-portfolio team “early in 2025… put IBIT allocations into one of our model portfolios.” For institutions, he argued that further episodes of Bitcoin “decoupling from equities in a… distressed market environment” would be “critical” in cementing its role as a diversifier. Asked about the SEC’s recent move to approve generic listing standards for commodity-based ETPs—the category that includes spot crypto ETFs—Mitchnick called it “a pragmatic step” that “streamlin[es] the process,” with clear, transparent standards that “support innovation.” Taken together, Mitchnick’s comments sketched the contours of BlackRock’s next steps without tipping its hand. On an XRP ETF, he didn’t confirm or deny anything—but he gave a clear readout of the bar any new product must clear: credible client demand, a defensible investment thesis, sufficient market depth and maturity, and a well-defined role in diversified portfolios. At press time, XRP traded at $2.71. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: BlackRock raises Bitcoin exposure by 38% in its $17.1 billion Global Allocation Fund

The diversified fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million as of July 31, up from 723,332 shares on Apr. 30. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund increased its holdings in the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) by 38.4% during the second quarter, according to a Sept. 26 SEC filing. As of July 31, the diversified fund held 1,000,808 IBIT shares valued at $66.4 million, up from 723,332 shares on Apr. 30. The addition of 277,476 shares represents the fund’s return to Bitcoin allocation after reducing exposure earlier this year. Year-over-year growth demonstrates accelerating Bitcoin adoption within BlackRock’s portfolio management. The fund held just 198,874 IBIT shares as of July 31, 2024, representing a 403% increase over the previous twelve months. IBIT represents 0.4% of the Global Allocation Fund’s $17.1 billion assets under management, a 62.5% increase from the 0.25% allocation recorded in the first quarter. The current weighting marks substantial growth from the 0.1% position held in October 2024. BlackRock recommended 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a “reasonable range” in its model portfolio on Feb. 28, positioning the Global Allocation Fund below its target range. The recent increases indicate movement toward this recommended exposure level through gradual and cautious accumulation. The Global Allocation Fund invests across US and international equities, debt securities, money market instruments, and other short-term assets. Portfolio composition varies periodically in response to market conditions and investment opportunities. BlackRock launched IBIT in January 2024 as part of the first wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of Sept. 25, the fund has the largest Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $61 billion in cumulative net flows. The Global Allocation Fund’s methodical approach to Bitcoin allocation demonstrates institutional investment strategies for crypto exposure. BlackRock continues building its position toward recommended portfolio weightings while managing volatility through gradual accumulation.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) hovering under $110,000 has traders debating whether support will hold or a drop below $100,000 is imminent. What Happened: Position trader Bob Loukas noted on X that Bitcoin is approaching its Weekly Cycle Low, five weeks after peaking. While $118,000 would confirm a new cycle, short-term control remains with the bears. Loukas highlighted that BTC failed to break its all-time highs in mid-August, signaling the weekly cycle peaked around Week 18. Despite this, he remains bullish on the late-stage 4-year cycle, citing altcoins holding up as BTC dominance drops—a classic late-cycle pattern. Trader Joe Consorti pointed out that Bitcoin endured $2.75 billion in long liquidations across just four days, two of the three largest events of 2025. CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten drew parallels to September 2024: Bitcoin trended higher, then fell 11% after losing the trend line, consolidated for two weeks, and broke higher in mid-October, without breaching the early September lows. Also Read: Bitcoin Tumbles To $111,000: Bear Market Beginnings Or Still A Bull Market Dip? Why It Matters: Prediction markets show traders now see a 61% chance of Bitcoin dipping below $100,000 before 2026, up from 41% last week. Similarly, the probability of BTC hitting $100,000 before $130,000 has jumped to 61% from 36% as of Sep. 19. These predictions come on the heels of a major options expiry today, with over $22.3 billion set to expire on Deribit. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said BlackRock has registered the iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, a covered call strategy designed to generate yield for Bitcoin holders. This product would complement its iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT, which has seen $60.7 billion in inflows since January 2024. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc.

Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc. Tricolor Auto Group, the nation’s seventh largest used car dealer (and 3rd biggest in Texas and California), just filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy – e.g. liquidation. Its target customer had been illegal aliens, and with President Trump deciding to start enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, there has suddenly been a major “market correction” in that market segment. Not only has the customer base largely evaporated, but so have loan repayments, which Tricolor also serviced. The “tri colors” that the name references are the colors of the Mexican flag – red, white, and green. While the sudden loss of customers and loan repayments was the catalyst that caused the final collapse of Tricolor, its failure has revealed so much more, including securities fraud, Wall Street ESG gimmickry, race-based federal programs, etc. Tricolor has securitized more than $2 billion of its very high risk auto loans over the past seven years. The most recent issuance was in June of this year, with JP Morgan Chase and other money center banks peddling more than $200 million of “social bonds” to credulous investors. These securities are certified as “social bonds” by the US Treasury’s CDFI (“Community Development Financial Institution” program because Tricolor focuses on selling its cars and financial services to underserved communities, specifically Spanish-speaking non-citizens. Tricolor’s CEO, Daniel Chu, was quoted by Barron’s in 2022 as stating, “No one else is providing meaningful dollar credit to an illegal immigrant.” As documented in this recent Barron’s article (“Tricolor Files for Bankruptcy, The Auto Lender Was Once an ESG Favorite,” “Financial institutions until recently touted their social bond purchases as part of their commitment to ESG—or environmental, social and governance—principles. BlackRock took a $90 million stake in Tricolor in 2021 as part of its Impact Opportunities Fund focusing on businesses and projects owned, led by, or serving members of minority groups.” Of course BlackRock was involved. You may recall that a major contributor to the financial crash of 2008 was Wall Street wizards packaging up a bunch of sub-prime mortgages, securitizing them, and then selling those “mortgage backed securities” to investors as something other than perfumed garbage. That is effectively what Tricolor has been doing with its auto loans, with the help of Wall Street. In a Tricolor press release from March of this year titled “Tricolor Closes $328 Million Securitization to Advance Financial Inclusion at Scale in Underserved Communities,” CEO Chu stated, ”By providing deserving people with access to reliable, affordable transportation, Tricolor, which operates across six states and ranks as the third largest used auto retailer in Texas and California, helps move them into the financial mainstream and reverse systemic financial inequities in America.” Like the other securities issuance I referenced, JP Morgan Chase also promoted these odious securities, along with Barclay’s and Fifth Third Bank. Per Car Dealership Guy, Tricolor’s bonds have collapsed to a value of 12 cents on the dollar, virtually wiping out the investors who bought those bonds. But as bad as this all sounds so far, it’s actually worse. There was massive fraud by Tricolor, which is causing losses to all parties who did business with it. The banks who were packaging Tricolor’s securities also had lines of credit extended to Tricolor. There was a recent regulatory filing by Fifth Third Bank revealing that it was booking a $200 million impairment (loss) for fraud involving one of its customers. In this filing, Fifth Third disclosed that there was “recently discovered alleged external fraudulent activity at a commercial borrower,” and that it “is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter.” Barron’s confirmed that this commercial borrower was Tricolor. JP Morgan Chase also has about $200 million in loans outstanding to Tricolor, so it too will almost certainly be booking a massive impairment charge for this unrecoverable debt. Some of the news reports about the Tricolor fraud state that collateral was “double pledged,” meaning that unbeknownst to the banks lending money to Tricolor, the collateral they thought was backing up their loans was also pledged to other banks. Tricolor was also the servicer of its “buy here – pay here” loan portfolio, remitting collected payments to the banks who securitized their loans. From my experience dealing with fraud in this arena, it is quite likely that there was some level of kiting / ponzi scheme at work, and a constant inflow of new debt was necessary to keep servicing old debt that was not supported by actual assets. Working in Tricolor’s favor to perpetuate the fraud was the aura of woke virtuosity that kept the money flowing in, which also helped shield Tricolor from appropriate due diligence by those same woke banks throwing money at it. Working against Tricolor was President Trump’s immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security issued this press release earlier this week: “Over 2 million Illegal Aliens Out of the United States in Less than 250 days.” This mass exodus of illegal aliens has obviously resulted in a collapse in Tricolor vehicle sales, but much of the existing customer base has now either been deported, or chose to self-deport. Their loans will obviously not be repaid. As for the cars being driven by illegal aliens who have left the country, Tricolor’s liquidators will see a huge loss on those vehicles that were surrendered. But the loss will be even worse on the cars that were simply abandoned to be stolen and stripped…or taken across the border. Blackrock, JP Morgan Chase, and all the other titans of Wall Street who bought into the hype about ESG investing deserve the loss they are going to take. But for American citizens seeking affordable used cars, there is some good news. Supply is about to improve in relation to demand. [buck.throckmorton at protonmail dot com] Comments 1 Sponge!

The most recent issuance was in June of this year, with JP Morgan Chase and other money center banks peddling more than $200 million of “social bonds” to credulous investors. These securities are certified as “social bonds” by the US Treasury’s CDFI (“Community Development Financial Institution)” program because Tricolor focuses on selling its cars and financial services to underserved communities, specifically Spanish-speaking non-citizens. ++++ There is so very much wrong with that, I don't even know where to begin.

Remember 2009? 2009 sucked in general, and sucked particularly for me. I had a lot of debt then, thanks to student loans. My income was okay, not great. But I had to have a car. The best deal on auto finance I could find was one of the big national banks, and the rate was a staggering 14.7%. Tight credit, lots of debt, short (but good) credit history all conspired to ensure that my car loan was *really* expensive. Was that a "financial inequity?"

Posted by: Dr. Claw at September 26, 2025 11:12 AM (jbnUc) 49 The banks who were packaging Tricolor’s securities also had lines of credit extended to Tricolor. There was a recent regulatory filing by Fifth Third Bank revealing that it was booking a $200 million impairment (loss) for fraud involving one of its customers. In this filing, Fifth Third disclosed that there was “recently discovered alleged external fraudulent activity at a commercial borrower,” and that it “is working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities in connection with this matter.” Barron’s confirmed that this commercial borrower was Tricolor. JP Morgan Chase also has about $200 million in loans outstanding to Tricolor, so it too will almost certainly be booking a massive impairment charge for this unrecoverable debt.

Posted by: Mister Scott (Formerly GWS) at September 26, 2025 11:13 AM (0N4FZ) 52 Tricolor was also the servicer of its “buy here – pay here” loan portfolio, remitting collected payments to the banks who securitized their loans. From my experience dealing with fraud in this arena, it is quite likely that there was some level of kiting / ponzi scheme at work, and a constant inflow of new debt was necessary to keep servicing old debt that was not supported by actual assets. ++++ Sounds a lot like 2002-2008. Not exactly, but close. Most collateral was not double-pledged in that period, but it was largely overvalued by underwriter(on purpose) to permit more leverage and major title problems that resulted in a lot of collateral being questionable when it came down. Thankfully, illegal alien used cars are a smaller market than real estate. Enjoy eating the losses, banks. Maybe one day you will learn. Posted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!) at September 26, 2025 11:13 AM (6bTRc) 53 I have to give proof of insurance when I've purchased vehicles. I'm sure that wasn't a requirement with Tricolor.

Their loans will obviously not be repaid. As for the cars being driven by illegal aliens who have left the country, Tricolor’s liquidators will see a huge loss on those vehicles that were surrendered. But the loss will be even worse on the cars that were simply abandoned to be stolen and stripped…or taken across the border. ++++ Overstating the value of collateral has been endemic for a long time. This is one of the reasons I would like to see a regulatory overhaul of finance institutions. The book should have to be marked to market every night and reserves adjusted accordingly. Being allowed to "mark to maturity" is how you get sudden collapses when everyone runs out of money, because "maturity" doesn't happen (default does, instead) and the collateral was shit and so the loss reserves run out instantly.

Posted by: Kratwurst at September 26, 2025 11:11 AM (83DvQ) ++++ They aren't. They're skilled financial products engineers. They create the synthesized product to spread risks around, then hand them off to skilled financial products salesmen. The salesmen then sell the products to fund managers and institutional investors who are looking for high-risk returns and understand the underlying risks (rare) or who are looking for an extra tenth of a point on other people's money. Skilled investing is rarely a thing. Skilled engineering and sales interfacing with other people's money usually is.

Posted by: Elric The Blade at September 26, 2025 11:32 AM (iFTx/) ++++ Right, what Tricolor was doing was much worse. At least in the traditional "buy here, pay here" model, the dealer carried the risk himself. This is more akin to the mortgage scam. Nicer cars (usually), financed to extremely poor credit lists. The dealer is the lender, but the dealer has no money. He has a warehouse credit facility at a major bank that he draws to issue the loan. He lends the money to the customer, who then hands it back to the dealer. It hits the credit line and enters the sales book as cash. The dealer now has a liability one side (the note), and capital on the other (the cash). Standard (and dangerous) vendor financing. But the dealer sells the note at a discount to an investment bank (often the one that holds the credit line), who then packages it up into risk-tiered securities and sells them on to investors somewhere else.

I loved how young student would challenge him on whatever crap they learned in philosophy class and he would quickly get their mind right. He went to Zambia to run a seminary to train men but due to health issues he returned. Godspeed Voddie, retired to be with the LORD at age 56.

Let that sink in for a moment — nearly three hundred federal agents, mingling among protesters, and we're just hearing about this now? But here's where it gets really infuriating. Just last December, the Department of Justice's own watchdog proudly announced there was "no evidence" of undercover FBI employees in the protest crowds. The Inspector General's report was crystal clear: no undercover agents at the Capitol on January 6. Period. End of story.

Posted by: Berserker-Dragonheads Division at September 26, 2025 12:08 PM (snZF9) 306 Chuck Martel the only direct evidence we have from the boss is very discouraging. The day he got his BBB passed, at the Iowa rally, he talked about exemptions (de facto temporary amnesty) for ag workers, you know, to help the poor farmers. Astonishing, really. Fortunately, apparently, the comment was met with silence from the crowd. Haven't checked lately, but recall that two months ago around 6 or 8 GOPe congressthings intro'd a bill for amnesty for ag and hospitality sector illegals. Stunning. And a good reminder of how bad things are. A massive, natural base of popular common sense support for reintro'ing rule of law in immigration surrounds a political class/business class that is utterly uninterested in legality, or social or economic consequences for citizens. Without Trump there'd be no hope at all. And with a Trump that is anything other than 100% all in, any hope based on analysis gets pretty thin. Three years from now, any Dem gets in the WH, it's as though Trump never existed, on this vital issue. There isn't much time, and there's barely any political margin of safety.

Posted by: mc at September 26, 2025 12:48 PM (TaHV5) 334 The illegal alien enema that Dr. Trump has prescribed is going to have a lot of economic knock-on effects. Supposedly, these aliens are paying taxes. Question is, are they? If they're off the books already, are employers keeping the withholdings themselves? And how much is spent to enforce gathering those taxes and fees? Especially locally, where corrupt mayors and governors play Sgt. Schultz - See nothin-k, know nothin-k. They have to for plausible deniability on who is here illegally. And there are the benefits sent illegally to non-US-citizens. Some by sloppy mistake, some by willful criminality - there's a recent article on how criminals in several countries made off with sbillions in health care funds, but stopped before trillions thanks to DOGE analysis. Most importantly: simple Supply and Demand. Demand drops because illegal alien demanders are being sent away. Not buying vehicles, housing, food. Hopefully that'll help with the inflation problem. Work Supply is also going to be a problem, which will mean price increases there. But the benefits will be to local workers, legal citizens. Ones less likely to remit money out of the country, out of the US economy.

The letter highlighted risks of deception, replication, and bioweapon instructions, though specifics were vague. Notably, figures such as Geoffrey Hinton and Gary Marcus signed despite differing views on AI. UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell provided concrete red lines in prior work, emphasizing safety-first design. Importance for marketers: Regulatory frameworks around AI could shape how brands deploy AI responsibly, with compliance influencing data usage, content generation, and advertising standards. Luma AI launches Ray3, a reasoning-capable video model. Luma AI introduced Ray3, the world's first reasoning video model, capable of multimodal reasoning and generating 16-bit HDR video in EXR format.

Pulse generates visual cards with tailored information such as event prep, health routines, and news, aiming to shift ChatGPT from reactive to proactive assistance. Privacy safeguards mirror standard ChatGPT policies, with feedback loops limited to individual users. Importance for marketers: Pulse highlights how personalization features could influence consumer engagement, shaping expectations for AI-driven marketing and raising data-use transparency issues. Musk's xAI sues OpenAI over alleged trade secret theft. Elon Musk's startup xAI has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it hired away employees to gain access to trade secrets tied to xAI's Grok chatbot and data center strategies.

Importance for marketers: The escalating legal battle underscores fierce competition in AI development, potentially affecting innovation cycles and the trustworthiness of AI providers in marketing applications.

Title: REX Shares and Osprey Debut The First-Ever US Ethereum ETF With Staking
URL: https://zycrypto.com/rex-shares-and-osprey-debut-the-first-ever-us-ethereum-etf-with-staking/
Time Published: 2025-09-26T12:48:20Z

Traditional investors in the United States will be able to gain direct exposure to a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), which has been introduced by financial institutions REX Shares and Osprey Funds. The REX-Osprey Ethereum staking ETF (ticker: ESK) debuted on US exchanges on Thursday, becoming the first regulated product offering spot ETH exposure while incorporating staking rewards. According to the September 25 press release, the fund “is the first U.S. fund to provide investors with cost-effective and convenient exposure to spot Ethereum via the 1940 Act ETF structure.” The investment vehicle also allows investors to participate in Ether’s proof-of-stake network by receiving monthly distributions without managing staking themselves. Staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to gain rewards by locking their tokens into the network, a process that previously required technical know-how and direct interaction with cryptocurrency protocols. By packaging staking into an ETF structure, REX Shares and Osprey seek to make that process accessible to a broader range of investors via traditional brokerage accounts. The existing U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs have accumulated roughly $25 billion in total assets under management since their launch early last year, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading the charge. ESK going live comes just weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delayed decisions on staking for Ethereum ETFs proposed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. Notably, unlike other staking ETH ETFs that still require approval from the SEC, REX-Osprey’s ETF is structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940 framework, which bypasses the standard 19b-4 filing process. REX-Osprey introduced its Solana Staking ETF (SSK) in early July, making it the first crypto staking-enabled ETF to be approved in America. The two companies are also responsible for launching the first ETFs tracking the prices of Ripple’s XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), which debuted last week, following the same Investment Company Act 1940 playbook. Last month, REX-Osprey submitted paperwork with the SEC for permission to list a BNB staking exchange-traded fund. The introduction of staking ETFs marks a new phase for the fast-growing crypto industry, combining income-generating features with exposure to digital assets, all within an SEC-regulated investment vehicle. Meanwhile, over 90 other ETF proposals featuring assets like XRP and Solana, structured under the Securities Act, are still awaiting the SEC’s regulatory approval — some with decisions looming in October.

Title: BlackRock doubles down on Bitcoin with new income-focused ETF

Designed to leverage Bitcoin's volatility, BlackRock's covered-call fund could disrupt the crypto ETF market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is extending its push into Bitcoin with a new fund designed to turn the asset’s volatility into investor yield. On Sept. 25, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that the firm had filed for a product called the iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, a covered-call fund structured under the ’33 Act. Unlike a traditional spot ETF that passively tracks Bitcoin’s price, the new product would layer an income strategy on top of BTC exposure. It plans to hold Bitcoin or related instruments while writing covered calls against those holdings to earn premiums. Those premiums would then be distributed to investors as income, allowing the fund to capture value from Bitcoin’s frequent price swings rather than simply mirror them. Meanwhile, Balchunas noted that this move could unsettle rival issuers already building income-based Bitcoin products, given BlackRock’s dominant position in the spot ETF market. The firm’s flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has grown into the largest crypto ETF globally, managing tens of billions in assets since its launch last year. Balchunas pointed out that the latest filing illustrates BlackRock’s strategic focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, rather than joining competitors in pursuing ETFs tied to smaller altcoins. Over the past months, several issuers, including Grayscale, have applied for products linked to assets like XRP and Solana. However, BlackRock appears content to double down on the proven market leaders. That strong conviction appears to be paying off as the firm’s early Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs generate over $260 million in annual revenue. Speaking on these numbers, Leon Waidman, the head of research at Onchain Foundation, said: “[BlackRock built] a quarter-billion-dollar business, almost overnight. For comparison, many fintech unicorns don’t make that in a decade. This isn’t experimentation anymore. The world’s largest asset manager has proven that crypto is a serious profit center.” However, the firm’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, argued that institutional participation in crypto ETFs remains in its early stages, suggesting more capital could flow in as regulated offerings mature. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: The #1 Waster of Healthcare Dollars and How to Stop It

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/26/2025 4:39:16 AM PDT by MtnClimber Washington steals HALF of healthcare spending! As Democrats threaten government shut-down over Medicaid cuts; as Americans are bracing for another increase in their healthcare costs; and as patients wait an average maximum of 132 days to see a primary care doctor, Americans can’t seem to wake up from the nightmare called U.S. healthcare. The rise in insurance premium costs is estimated at 7–10 percent next year. This is on top of already unaffordable family spending with the average American family expending $32,066 on healthcare in 2024 according to Milliman Medical Index. Faced with increasing pressure on their bottom lines, employers are passing these additional expenses on to employees with reduced benefits, narrower medical panels (which means longer wait times), plus higher deductibles and copays. Republicans plan cuts to Medicaid that Democrats and the complicit media say these cuts will “hurt families,” “increase uncompensated care,” “and lead to thousands of deaths.” Biden’s 2021–2023 lockdowns threw millions of people out of work. Unemployment made them ineligible for employer-supported health insurance. Biden then expanded eligibility, adding 17 million Americans to Medicaid rolls. More than 60 percent of these individuals have returned to work and become (again) eligible for employer-provided insurance. Cutting them from Medicaid rolls will actually increase funds available to pay for those who truly need Medicaid. NPR business analyst Maria Aspan is clear about whom she blames for elevated costs: “insurers, drug companies and your employer,” along with the Trump administration that has “government-sponsored alternatives” it won’t use, she says. Last year, the U.S. spent $4.8 trillion on its healthcare system. That amount is greater than the entire GDP ($4.7 trillion) of the third-most productive nation on earth, Germany.

Is the $32,066 on healthcare accurate based on what FReepers younger than age 65 are spending?

The rise in insurance premium costs is estimated at 7–10 percent next year. This is on top of already unaffordable family spending with the average American family expending $32,066 on healthcare in 2024 according to Milliman Medical Index. Faced with increasing pressure on their bottom lines, employers are passing these additional expenses on to employees with reduced benefits, narrower medical panels (which means longer wait times), plus higher deductibles and copays. Republicans plan cuts to Medicaid that Democrats and the complicit media say these cuts will “hurt families,” “increase uncompensated care,” “and lead to thousands of deaths.” Biden’s 2021–2023 lockdowns threw millions of people out of work. Unemployment made them ineligible for employer-supported health insurance. Biden then expanded eligibility, adding 17 million Americans to Medicaid rolls. More than 60 percent of these individuals have returned to work and become (again) eligible for employer-provided insurance. Cutting them from Medicaid rolls will actually increase funds available to pay for those who truly need Medicaid. NPR business analyst Maria Aspan is clear about whom she blames for elevated costs: “insurers, drug companies and your employer,” along with the Trump administration that has “government-sponsored alternatives” it won’t use, she says. Last year, the U.S. spent $4.8 trillion on its healthcare system. That amount is greater than the entire GDP ($4.7 trillion) of the third-most productive nation on earth, Germany.

Republicans plan cuts to Medicaid that Democrats and the complicit media say these cuts will “hurt families,” “increase uncompensated care,” “and lead to thousands of deaths.” Biden’s 2021–2023 lockdowns threw millions of people out of work. Unemployment made them ineligible for employer-supported health insurance. Biden then expanded eligibility, adding 17 million Americans to Medicaid rolls. More than 60 percent of these individuals have returned to work and become (again) eligible for employer-provided insurance. Cutting them from Medicaid rolls will actually increase funds available to pay for those who truly need Medicaid. NPR business analyst Maria Aspan is clear about whom she blames for elevated costs: “insurers, drug companies and your employer,” along with the Trump administration that has “government-sponsored alternatives” it won’t use, she says.

Waste, fraud, abuse and inefficient government bureaucrats, Health is not the actual point of this type of socialist program.

Is the $32,066 on healthcare accurate based on what FReepers younger than age 65 are spending? It seems high since those people under age 65 do not usually have that many medical problems. If every last public employee in this country was required to enroll in Obamacare for their Primary health Care at their Own Expense. It would be fixed overnight. My first doctor in the ‘60’s told me that when he started it was expected a doctor would spend some of his time working for free in a charity hospital. He ticked off the charity hospitals he’d worked at. Then, he said, the government forced the charity hospitals out of existence. As an outgrowth of that he pointed out my window to where the older doctors parked vs the new ones. The older doctors drove older cars like Mustangs and Cougars. The new doctors drove all foreign makes. He said medicine had gone in schools from a calling to what he derisively called “Pre money” instead of premed. They are talking about insurance premium costs, not occurred healthcare output. Yes, they are outrageous... More than a mortgage payment for a family with kids.

Further, the outlook is shaped by fundamental, macro and cyclical factors. It is noted that while recent earnings trends have been uneven across sectors, conditions are expected to begin stabilising in the coming months. The fund house, a 50:50 joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global asset management giant BlackRock, is positioning itself as a challenger brand in India’s crowded mutual fund industry, which already has more than 40 players. As part of its expansion, JioBlackRock has launched the Flexi Cap Fund, benchmarked against the NSE 500 index. The new fund -- JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund -- is powered by BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) approach. According to Kohli, a bulk of the portfolio will be invested in large-cap stocks because of the benchmark it is tracking. A key differentiator, according to the AMC, is the integration of BlackRock’s four-decade-old Systematic Active Equities platform, which blends big data, analytics, and human oversight to enhance portfolio construction. “The Flexi Cap Fund is our first active equity offering that leverages BlackRock’s proprietary Systematic Active Equity approach. This reflects our commitment to offering investors a dynamic, differentiated and potentially low-cost investment solution,” he said. According to him, backed by SAE, the fund aims to deliver long-term value through a disciplined investment process within a controlled risk framework across market cycles. The new fund is being offered at a total expense ratio of 0.50 per cent, among the lowest in its category. The new fund offer (NFO) is open until October 7.

Title: Ethereum price at crossroads, tests key support at $3,800 as analysts point at possible rebound

Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture as price tests support near $3,800 after a sharp pullback from recent highs. Analysts are now weighing the technical damage against on-chain signals that point in different directions. Recently, the price of ETH slipped below $4,000 and is now trading around the mid-$3,800s. The 24-hour range shows intraday swings between $3,833.75 and $4,051.26, while analysts single out the $3,800–$3,850 band as the immediate line of defence and $3,500–$3,400 as deeper liquidity zones if sellers push further. Notably, the Ethereum price has fallen beneath the clustered 20, 50 and 100-EMAs, which currently sit roughly between $4,083 and $4,238 and now act as resistance. Momentum indicators have also weakened, with the four‑hour RSI sitting near 29, indicating oversold conditions that often precede short relief rallies. On-chain flow metrics show notable exchange inflows, with a recent spike of about $66.7 million moved onto spot venues. That movement coincided with ETH dropping below $4,000, and it signals that some holders are routing coins to exchanges to sell. Large wallets holding more than 100,000 ETH have trimmed positions sharply, a development many analysts interpret as increased selling by the largest holders. At the same time, mid‑sized entities — addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH — are accumulating and taking a more prominent role in on‑chain ownership dynamics as highlighted by Joao Wedson. This transfer of supply from the very largest wallets toward a concentrated set of mid‑sized “sharks” has nudged the Gini coefficient higher after months of decline, underscoring renewed ownership concentration among wealthier addresses. The number of Ethereum whales is dropping sharply – and the sharks are now in the game! It’s the sharks (10k–100k ETH holders) who have been accumulating and taking a larger share of the market. Meanwhile, the Gini coefficient has stopped falling and is starting to rise again,… pic.twitter.com/Lk2E6saulJ — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) September 24, 2025 While these movements are seen as dynamic by some, it is also viewed as a double‑edged sword by others since it reduces one class of outsized selling but increase concentration risk. The Ethereum price correction has triggered heavy market liquidations, with roughly $409 million in Ethereum long positions liquidated. Funding rates on ETH futures have also flashed negative recently, according to Coinglass data, adding to the momentum behind short‑term selling. Institutional flows, especially on the Ethereum ETFs front, also paint a mixed picture, with some funds recording large inflows while others see significant outflows. Notably, over the recent week, more than $560 million reportedly moved into ETH‑linked funds, with BlackRock‑led products among the largest recipients, even as REX‑Osprey launched the first US staking Ether ETF. Views among market commentators diverge sharply, and long‑term bulls like Ted Pillows argue that ETH could ultimately trend well above $10,000 this cycle, though he anticipates a short‑term revisit to the $3,600–$3,800 area. $ETH is going above $10,000 this cycle. But before that, a correction will happen, and right now, it's happening. I think ETH could drop towards the $3,600-$3,800 level before a reversal and a new ATH. pic.twitter.com/Yy87rjHVAB — Ted (@TedPillows) September 23, 2025 Most importantly, reclaiming the $4,083–$4,330 zone would ease bearish pressure and could open a path back to $5,000. Conversely, a failure to hold critical supports would expose lower bands at $3,162 and $2,874, while the 200‑day EMA sits as a structural defence near $3,350.

Title: BlackRock exec says crypto ETF institutional adoption still early, XRP and SOL ETFs unconfirmed

Robbie Mitchnick stated that institutional penetration lags significantly behind retail adoption, despite the success of products such as IBIT and ETHA. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s global head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, believes the institutional adoption of crypto exchange-traded funds is still in its early stages. During a Sept. 25 interview with the Crypto Prime podcast, Mitchnick stated that institutional penetration lags significantly behind retail adoption, despite the success of products such as BlackRock’s Bitcoin (IBIT) and Ethereum (ETHA) ETFs. He added: “The vast majority of advisors in the US today still do not have the ability to make decisions on this on behalf of their clients.” Mitchnick said that most wealth management firms approved crypto ETFs for execution-only transactions, requiring clients to initiate purchases themselves rather than advisors making portfolio allocation decisions. Only a few leading-edge firms have crossed this threshold, with BlackRock’s model portfolio teams adding IBIT allocations for the first time in early 2025. Mitchnick also discussed the framework applied by BlackRock to decide on the launch of new crypto ETFs. Client demand is the primary driver, with the asset manager assessing the level of demand, the logic of the investment, and the problems the product solves. The next step is evaluating liquidity and maturity, culminating in BlackRock having clarity on its investment thesis and overall product and portfolio considerations. When questioned about potential ETFs tracking Solana and XRP, Mitchnick completely deflected and wouldn’t comment on the matter. Ethereum ETF demand faces constraints due to the inability to offer staking rewards, which typically provide annual yields of 3% to 4%. Mitchnick said that it had some impact on demand for these products. The staking integration involves complex tax and liquidity considerations within the grantor trust structure used by crypto ETPs. Staked Ethereum requires an unbonding period before it becomes freely tradable, which conflicts with ETF liquidity requirements. As a result, Mitchnick said that Bitcoin attracts broader institutional interest due to clearer positioning as “digital gold,” acting as a portfolio diversifier similar to traditional gold allocations. Meanwhile, Ethereum requires more nuanced discussions as a technology bet on blockchain adoption, resembling tech equities or venture capital investments. BlackRock sees limited tokenization opportunities beyond money market funds, where the technology creates clear utility by enabling 24/7 liquidity while maintaining full yield access. Mitchnick noted: “A lot of projects in the early years have gone wayward because they merely relied on that high-level value prop.” Lastly, he said that the firm remains bullish on stablecoins expanding beyond their current use in crypto trading to include cross-border payments and financial market settlement.

Irish Life Investment Managers hires BlackRock executive to run TirNua Capital Partners It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will support Ireland’s energy transition. Stock image: Getty A major new fund to invest in ­Ireland’s energy transition infrastructure is being launched by Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), the Irish Independent has learned. It has established a new unit to manage the fund, called TirNua Capital Partners. The group, part of Canada’s Great-West Lifeco, has hired David O’Brien as chief executive of TirNua Capital Partners. He was previously managing director and co-head of the Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, a unit of US investment giant BlackRock. Irish Life Investment Managers declined to comment. As of the end of 2024, Irish Life Investment Managers had more than €131bn of assets under management. It is the largest life and pensions group and fund manager in Ireland. In 2023, BlackRock achieved the first close of its Evergreen investment infrastructure fund, securing almost $1bn (€856m) in commitments from its founding partners. The open-ended equity fund focuses on investments in European and North American infrastructure connected to energy transition and energy security. It has cornerstone commitments from European Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo and Inarcassa, Italy’s national pension fund for engineers and architects. Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will also focus on investing in infrastructure assets that will support Ireland’s energy transition. Ireland has a target of seeing 80pc of its energy needs provided from renewable sources by 2030. The Government also hopes to have at least 5GW of offshore generating capacity installed by then. By 2050, it hopes to have 37GW of offshore renewable energy capacity installed. However, the 80pc target is unlikely to be met. Industry executives point to a slow planning process, what they claim are inefficient energy capacity auctions, and the system of judicial reviews as hindering the pace of development. The target for the deployment of offshore energy capacity is also unlikely to be met. While at BlackRock, Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments. As co-head of BlackRock Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, he led the fund’s development, fundraising and investment activities. Before joining BlackRock in 2011, he was director of corporate finance at Irish firm NTR, where he worked for six years.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed today for a Bitcoin premium income ETF in Delaware. The proposed fund represents a new investment product designed to generate income through Bitcoin-related premiums. The filing extends BlackRock’s crypto expansion beyond its spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which reached $90 billion in assets under management by September 2025. The firm captured 60% of the US Bitcoin ETF market share with IBIT. BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs generated $260 million in annual revenue less than two years after launch. The asset manager has been adding Bitcoin exposure to its in-house funds, with model portfolios allocating 1%-2% to crypto assets. The premium income structure targets income-focused investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with yield generation, differentiating it from BlackRock’s existing spot Bitcoin product that tracks the cryptocurrency’s price movements directly.

Title: ‘I was hoping for Paul Mescal,’ tourist says after meeting Jim Gavin on campaign trail

Jim Gavin chatted to Canadian couple Maja Crawley and Colin Landrie during a short Dart journey between Blackrock and Dalkey in South Dublin on Thursday. The pair seemed somewhat bemused to have come upon the Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate’s large entourage during their journey. An Irish Rail staff member kept a close eye to make sure there was no canvassing on board as this is a no-no for the transport company. Team Gavin told him they were only on board to “get from A to B” and the candidate was on safe ground talking to the Canadian pair who do not have a vote in the election. Dún Laoghaire TD Cormac Devlin told the tourists that Taoiseach Micheál Martin was in Canada to meet their prime minister Mark Carney. So did the couple from Winnipeg, Manitoba, expect to encounter a presidential election candidate on their trip to Ireland? “I was hoping for Paul Mescal or Dermot Kennedy,” Ms Crawley said. Mr Gavin does not have the same kind of star power as the actor or the singer-songwriter, but who does in fairness? The former Dublin GAA manager, a newcomer to politics, does enjoy some fame due to his multiple All-Ireland winning efforts and there was the odd ‘Up the Dubs’ as he canvassed in the South Dublin suburbs. He met footballers Paul Mannion and Con O’Callaghan in Dún Laoghaire. The pair later featured in a campaign video backing him. But what is Mr Gavin telling voters regarding his plans for the presidency? Voters Anne O’Leary and Rimiko Ogata got the pitch in a Blackrock cafe. They got a technical explanation of the powers of the presidency, such as scrutinising Bills and appointing taoisigh and ministers after elections. He also said the office had “the power to highlight things” like disadvantage and “those who mightn’t have a voice” and to “shine a light on people who provide services”. This would be a “big part” of his presidency, he told them. Ms O’Leary asked for an example and Mr Gavin mentioned the kind of places he visited while canvassing in Navan, Co Meath, the previous day including a childcare centre. “It’s about highlighting the really good things in the country,” he said. Speaking afterwards, Ms O’Leary and Ms Ogata said they had not been Fianna Fáil supporters in the past, but would consider voting for Mr Gavin. Ms O’Leary said that with Mr Martin as leader she was more open to the party. Ms Ogata agreed. Mr Gavin, of course, is the person the Taoiseach backed to be Fianna Fáil’s candidate. He held off Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher in the internal parliamentary party vote to select a candidate, but by a thinner margin than many expected. One of Mr Kelleher’s supporters in that contest, Dublin MEP Barry Andrews, was on the canvass with Mr Gavin. Is he ruing the fact that it is Mr Gavin rather than Mr Kelleher pounding the pavements on the campaign trail? “It’s ancient history,” Mr Andrews said. “We had a great contest and are delighted that Jim is our candidate. “We’re very lucky. His record of service is really unbelievable. I came across him in humanitarian work when I was in [aid agency] Goal and he was in the Air Corps. “In the next four weeks he’ll grow as a candidate and get to know the people.” More importantly, does he believe Mr Gavin can stay ahead of the Fine Gael candidate, Heather Humphreys, when it comes to first preference votes? “I think so, yeah,” Mr Andrews said. A widely held view among commentators is that whichever Coalition party candidate is ahead – Mr Gavin or Ms Humphreys – will benefit from transfers from the other, propelling them to the presidency over left-wing Independent Catherine Connolly, who is backed by Opposition parties. Mr Andrews said “the concentration on first preference will be the main thing here” and “that’s why he’s working as hard as he is”. “He’s an amazingly energetic candidate,” he said. “People are really responding to him well on the road.” In Blackrock, Eugene Kenny, from “a Fianna Fáil house”, said he would vote for Mr Gavin as “he seems to be the best of the three at the moment”. He described him as a “middle-of-the-road kind of guy” who is “able to speak pretty well”. Another voter in the village, Jane McGauran, told Mr Gavin how Ms Connolly was particularly vocal on the horror of the war in Gaza. Dr McGauran is a volunteer with the Children Not Numbers charity and is a member of Irish Healthcare Workers for Palestine. She is in contact with families in Gaza who have “very sick children” including some with injuries from explosives. She asked if Mr Gavin would speak out about the war and advocate for injured children to come to Ireland. He told her what was happening in Gaza was “genocide” and said he would “speak out against that”. “The fighting needs to stop, the hostages need to be handed back by Hamas and we need to get aid into Gaza and to get those women and children and people out,” he said. “So I will champion that.” She later said she was impressed with Mr Gavin’s answer. “I hope he follows through.” Would she vote for him? “I’ll read his manifesto and I’ll have a think about it. I haven’t decided,” said the doctor, who is also considering voting for Ms Connolly. In these early days of the campaign, Dr McGauran was not alone during the canvass in being in the “thinking about it” category when it comes to Mr Gavin.

Title: Is XRP Finally Coming To BlackRock? Ripple Drops Bombshell Announcement

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple has unveiled a partnership that places its RLUSD stablecoin at the center of tokenized finance involving BlackRock and VanEck. The announcement, which was shared on the company’s official X account, connects Ripple directly to tokenized versions of institutional funds and sets the stage for deeper integration between the XRP Ledger and some of the largest names in asset management. Ripple confirmed that it is working with Securitize,the world’s largest tokenization platform, to bring in real-time liquidity for institutional assets provided by BlackRock and VanEck. Through this arrangement, holders of BlackRock’s $BUIDL and VanEck’s $VBILL can instantly convert their fund shares into RLUSD, allowing them to retain access to on-chain yield. With the partnership, BUIDL and VBILL holders will now be able to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD 24/7. Acording to the announcement, Securitize is also expanding integration with the XRP Ledger. Considering Securitize is one of the largest tokenization platform, this move increases the XRP ecosystem’s exposure to tokenized assets and strengthens Ripple’s push to imporove its on-chain financial infrastructure. “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple. “ Speculation around Ripple’s relationship with BlackRock has been building for months, and many in the industry have linked Ripple’s cross-border settlement technology to the asset manager’s vision for tokenization. The company is now working to tokenize $2 trillion worth of assets on the blockchain. BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), in March 2024, doing so through Securitize’s infrastructure. Securitize serves as the platform that tokenizes BlackRock’s fund, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership of the underlying real-world assets. The implications are significant. Ripple has managed to secure a foothold in the conversation by tying RLUSD to tokenized funds. Ripple’s RLUSD is now linked not only to BlackRock’s BUIDL but also to VanEck’s VBILL fund. This creates a direct link between Ripple’s stablecoin ecosystem and products from two of the world’s biggest asset managers. The partnership can be viewed as an important step that could eventually pave the way for XRP itself to be tied into BlackRock’s tokenization efforts. This partnership also speaks to Ripple’s strategy of expanding the utility of RLUSD. Since its launch, the stablecoin has steadily grown in adoption, reaching a market capitalization of about $742 million. The collaboration with Securitize, and through it with BlackRock and VanEck, also improves XRPL’s presence in the real-world asset (RWA) tonization sector.
