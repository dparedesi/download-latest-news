The transition of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. from Democrat to independent to (gasp!) Republican was a popcorn-grabbing sideshow of the 2024 election season — until it became the main event. The defection of Bobby Kennedy to Team Trump was a seismic shift in an already bizarre presidential election, but it also formed a more perfect union — between MAGA and MAHA (Make America Healthy Again). And if President-Elect Donald Trump fails to deliver on his MAHA commitments, MAGA will collapse in the broken bargain. MAHA was not merely a clever pivot of campaign messaging; it was a melding of policy platforms necessary to reclaim Americans’ creed of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” MAGA is not about returning the nation to the 1950s; it is about restoring the Rule of Law, fiscal integrity, regulated borders, citizen security, and trust in the government. It is about reclaiming free speech and worship; equality of all, regardless of race or identity alphabet; and accountability for government agencies that lied about the Steele Dossier, Hunter Biden’s laptop, and the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 “interventions.” MAGA is about re-establishing basic constitutional liberties for all Americans. No MAGA, no MAHA. What good is liberty without health? The merging of the Kennedy platform with Trump’s offered Americans a dual vision — not just for economic growth and safer streets, but safer meals and a shift toward reducing illness, especially for children. Kennedy is correct about the health crisis unfolding in America. Who could possibly oppose MAHA? Democrats, for one. If Donald Trump advised taking daily vitamins, Democrats would likely dump their Geritol and Flintstones chewables into their toilets. However, another group is even more opposed to the MAHA plan: industrial agriculture and food processing interests. Politico reported on the battle over Trump’s choice for USDA that “some in the agriculture industry and on Capitol Hill ... [are] relieved the president-elect did not tap someone more openly aligned with Kennedy and his critiques of the current agriculture system.” The battle for USDA chief represents the battle for the soul of the nation’s future: [Kennedy has] openly promised to go to war with large agriculture interests he argues are at the root of Americans’ twin obesity and chronic health crises. But those fights lie within USDA, which oversees a $430 billion–plus yearly budget and 100,000 employees, touching nearly every part of the country’s $1.5 trillion food and agriculture industry. Not HHS. Farm state lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also been skeptical that Trump would actually allow Kennedy to follow through on his promises to upend the food system and go to war against big corporate agriculture interests, including those that are protected by rural Republicans. Several candidates for Cabinet posts even tried to lean on the strong ties to the corporate agriculture sector within Trump’s inner circle. A war on conventional agriculture is not in the cards even for Kennedy — the nation cannot transition away from its industrial food dependency as easily as Bobby did from toxic Democrats. However, if the industrial stranglehold on Americans’ food production and processing is not broken, the nation’s children, along with its water, soils, and food supplies, will continue to decline. There are trillions of dollars of federal subsidies involved in food production. The industrial “stakeholders” (not consumer “steakholders” or local farmers) are ultimately the beneficiaries of all those tax dollars. They will not allow Bobby to take away their cash cow without a fight. If Donald Trump does not deliver on promises to improve Americans’ health and food supplies, he will do more than merely break a political pledge — he will fall on the battlefield with banner in hand before even being sworn in. There is no life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness without healthy, local food supplies. Control the food, control the people — and their guns, worship times, political views, and ability to live. It is a tactic older than siege warfare. Stalin and Mao were mere dabblers compared to what the globalist cabal of the U.N., WHO, and WEF have in store for the global human population. Syngenta, Bayer, and BlackRock all sit as “partners” at the WEF table, crafting totalitarian plans to subjugate all food production under an industrial system that creates absolute dependency. Humans must eat plants and eliminate cows — but is that to save the world or to solidify corporate profits and globalist domination? These same companies, and many others, sit also in the corridors of the federal government, determined to retain their regulatory capture not just of the EPA and FDA, but of the pivotal USDA. Democrats claim they oppose corporate profiteers, but they have flung open the nation’s bureaucratic doors to corporate control — how about those PFAS being generated by renewables manufacturing? Forever chemicals for the little children, anyone? There is no persuasiveness for conservatives targeting renewables polluters if Big Ag is left in charge of food supplies. Control the food, control the people. Make the food healthier and more secure, and win We the People over for 2026 and 2028. Abandon food production to globalist profiteers, and all is lost. No MAHA, no MAGA. MAHA and MAGA go together. Free speech for cancer patients and obese children is not a life of liberty and pursuing happiness, but an irreversible dystopian doom. Kennedy has committed his entire being to thwart industrial domination of food. If Donald Trump does not heed Bobby’s warnings, the promises of MAGA will ring hollow as Americans’ health and life expectancies continue to plummet. Conservatives will lose all credibility with the electorate they promised to rescue from food enslavement, and they will sicken themselves and their children in the political process.

Title: ‘Every torch on the shore, every light at sea, represented someone who cared’ for teacher Máire Ní Fhatharta

Recovery of body gave family and friends space to grieve the loss of sea swimmer Máire Ní Fhátharta was described as 'kind' and 'dedicated' in tributes from family and her employer Volunteers at Silverstrand in Galway during the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta. Picture by Andy Newman. Máire Ní Fhatharta and her partner Dan King, who took a leading role in the search for her body Máire Ní Fhatharta, who died after going for a swim nearly three weeks ago Thick fog enveloped the northern shores of Galway Bay on the morning of November 12, and it never really lifted for the next 10 days. True, there were days of bright sunshine and falls of snow that transformed the Burren, along with icy winds that stung the skin. But over the second week of the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta, there was no talk of elections in Galway West — only a growing sense of apprehension as Storm Bert approached. The 32-year-old teacher would have known the bay’s vagaries, growing up close to its shores at Doire Locháin Thoir between na Forbacha and An Spidéal. Like musician Johnny Duhan, she was a morning sea swimmer. Silverstrand, a popular spot west of Salthill’s Blackrock, with a commanding view of Black Head, became busier for winter dippers during the Covid-19 pandemic. On that fateful morning nearly three weeks ago, the sea was calm and still below dense and freezing fog. For anyone there early, low tide at 7.42am required a walk out from the shoreline. Disorientation and hypothermia could have set in within minutes. The initial alarm was for Mr Duhan, who had not returned home. It was only when Ms Ní Fhatharta did not arrive at work that a second search ensued in the early afternoon, led by the Irish Coast Guard’s Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Valentia, Co Kerry, and Galway gardaí. By then, the 74-year-old songwriter’s body had been recovered on the incoming tide. However, the lingering fog precluded a helicopter search for the young woman. Galway Bay inshore lifeboat was launched and was quickly joined by kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders, inshore fishing and sea angling vessels, sailing club members and others with access to rigid inflatable boats (RIBs). Volunteers at Silverstrand in Galway during the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta. Picture by Andy Newman. Down at Silverstrand, gardaí set up a command structure where volunteers were encouraged to register. The Civil Defence joined in, as did Coast Guard units from Costelloe Bay, Cleggan and Killaloe, and drone searches were initiated by Cleggan and Doolin Coast Guard. Meanwhile, a WhatsApp group had been set up by friends and family, named “Bring Máire Home”, where volunteers were given regular updates on the location and time of shore team searches extending from Oranmore to An Cheathrú Rua. Family, including Ms Ní Fhatharta’s sisters, Fionnuala and Maighréad, moved into a camper van parked at Silverstrand, where friends joined them to help provide support. Onshore searches were co-ordinated from there by Ms Ní Fhatharta’s brother Tomas and brother-in-law Jack. Many who have had direct experience of the bay’s hazards were first to offer help, including Deirdre and Johnny Glynn. In August 2020, their daughter Ellen and her cousin Sara Feeney were rescued after over 15 hours at sea when their paddleboards were swept out from Na Forbacha beach by a northerly wind. She was the kindest, funniest, most special person I’ve ever known and probably will ever know ​As the Glynns and others discovered during their own long night of darkness, Galway Bay may be named Loch Lurgan, but it is a vast territory of over 300 square kilometres. The paddleboarders were rescued by Patrick and Morgan Oliver, but many families have not been so fortunate. During the early days of the search for Ms Ní Fhatharta, the body of a 45-year old woman from Cork, whose car had been found in Liscannor, Co Clare, was recovered from the water off the Aran island of Inis Oírr. Ms Ní Fhatharta had a lot to live for. She had taught in Scoil Iognaid and Gaeilscoil de hÍde, and had just started a new job in August as an Irish language planning officer with Fóram Cois Fharraige in An Spidéal. Her sisters painted a portrait of her in an interview with RTÉ Radio News at One. “Everyone who met her fell instantly in love with her, she was just something else,” Maighréad said. “She was the kindest, funniest, most special person I’ve ever known and probably will ever know. She was the best sister and friend, and partner to Dan, and we’re all very lucky to have known her.” Máire Ní Fhatharta and her partner Dan King, who took a leading role in the search for her body Describing her as a woman with a “wealth of skills”, Fóram Cois Fharraige said: “It was clear from that first day that she was a dedicated, serious, energetic woman, with a particular commitment to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.” The shape of each day was framed by the checking of tide tables and the weather as family and work routines were amended or suspended. At night, and under a full moon during the first week, the beams of hundreds of torches became a regular feature on the many parts of the long, rocky, indented shoreline, stretching 45km from Oranmore to Indreabhán alone. Young friends and family, some of whom flew long distances to help, were assigned zones and team leaders. There were regular reminders that safety was paramount, but there were several minor incidents in challenging weather. Ms Ní Fhatharta’s partner, Dan King, knew how to co-ordinate the community element of the search at sea. An experienced sailor, he was previously a member of the Galway RNLI inshore lifeboat crew. He has windsurfed and stand-up paddleboarded at a high level for most of his life. In a cutting north-easterly wind, six layers of clothing could not keep the cold out in RIBs Search tracks were uploaded daily by boats and diving teams from Galway and Athlone and as far away as Mallow and Monaghan. There were also updates of the Marine Institute’s “Adrift” tool, which uses tidal, weather and river-flow data to provide a realistic simulation of missing persons at sea. By Sunday, November 17, the weather was more challenging, and by early that second week the forecast was for ice and snow. In a cutting north-easterly wind, six layers of clothing could not keep the cold out in RIBs. For kayakers and jet-skiers, it was a particularly arduous endurance test. “Our WhatsApp group for the on-land search was capped at 2,000 people and we frequently exceeded this cap,” said Mr King. “On water, we had over 60 vessels, 300 people per day ranging from commercial fishing vessels — from the Aran islands, Rossaveal and Clogherhead, Co Louth — to the Coast Guard, RNLI, Civil Defence, along with private boats, sub-aqua clubs, stand-up paddle boards, kayaks and swimmers.” Máire Ní Fhatharta, who died after going for a swim nearly three weeks ago In another cruel twist, there was a power cut in the early hours of Thursday, November 21, across much of south Connemara. The ESB network infrastructure had been badly damaged by snow. With the weekend storm approaching, word was that the state rescue agencies would have to stand down at some point. Those with experience of searches knew days seven to 10 would be key. ​That Thursday evening on WhatsApp, Mr King gave a rallying call to all the volunteers: “Let’s hope tomorrow is the day.” Across the city and county, quiet tears were shed And so it was. At around 4pm on Friday, November 22, just hours before Storm Bert, there was a sighting by the Rescue 115 helicopter near Silverstrand. A kayaker was asked to investigate. Ms Ní Fhatharta’s body was located, not far from where she had left for her swim. Across the city and county, quiet tears were shed. One volunteer who had been on many searches tried to articulate the feeling. “It’s the power of the collective at a time of wider bleak world events beyond our control, and it was so palpable,” they said. “Every torch on the shore, every light at sea, that represented someone who cares.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Why Is Chevron Corporation (CVX) Among the Best American Energy Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other American energy stocks. The energy industry includes stocks that are involved in the production or supply of energy. Companies engaged in oil and gas drilling, refining, and discovering and developing oil or gas reserves are all part of the energy sector or industry. The energy industry also comprises integrated power utility companies that use renewable energy and coal. Energy companies continue to suffer challenges as oil supply exceeds demand. Oil prices have been below $70/barrel since early September. According to U.S. Bank Asset Management's senior investment strategy director, Rob Haworth: "The oil market is one that remains well supplied but isn’t well demanded." Although the U.S. economy is strong, other major oil users like China and Germany are experiencing economic challenges. As a result, global demand is lagging.” Nonetheless, a number of energy companies have made encouraging achievements in 2024, and investors have reaped financial rewards as the energy sector of the broader market has grown by 12.74% since the start of the year. Based on exceptional results in 2021 and 2022, it has increased by 19.89% in just three years and by 10.61% growth over the previous five years. However, according to RSM’s Energy Outlook 2024 report, the North American energy sector will confront significant potential problems due to a global move toward renewable energy sources, aging infrastructure, and rising electricity consumption. Infrastructure limitations continue to be a major obstacle. Scalability concerns have been brought to light by record U.S. oil and natural gas output as well as a boom in renewable energy, affecting projects like solar farms in California and drilling in Texas. These challenges show how urgently infrastructure modernization investments are needed. As per the aforementioned report, North America's demand for electricity has increased to levels not seen in many years. Emerging technologies like green hydrogen, the use of electric vehicles, and growing data centers are important drivers. The use of machine learning and other analytical AI technology is growing among energy companies. This change alters the energy sector and aligns with tax incentives and the company's environmental, social, and governance goals. Most importantly, integrating clean energy is essential as companies adjust to meet rising demand sustainably. According to BloombergNEF, $303 billion was spent on U.S. renewable energy in 2023, a 22% increase from the year before, showing the continued pace of the energy transformation. Globally, $1.77 trillion was invested, signifying a strong push toward decarbonization. Even though renewable energy requires more cash, companies of all sizes—from startups to established oil and gas companies—are shifting their focus to renewables as the case for clean energy grows. This change sets up the energy industry for a significant and sustainable future. We sifted through holdings of Energy ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 American Energy stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. We have used the stock's market cap as of November 21, 2024, as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) An aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 63 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a global energy business that engages in exploration, production, and refining. It produces 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes 1.8 million barrels of liquids and 7.7 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, making it the second-largest oil company in the United States. Production occurs throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, and North America. It can refine 1.8 million barrels of oil per day at its refineries in the US and Asia. At the end of 2023, proven reserves were 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which included 30.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 6.0 billion barrels of liquids. CVX has surged by over 8% since the start of 2024, coming through as one of the best American stocks to buy. Despite a decline from the previous year, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s third-quarter adjusted earnings were above market forecasts. The Permian Basin's record output propelled the company's 7% YoY growth in net oil-equivalent production. The company also started production on significant Gulf of Mexico projects in the United States. It announced a $6.5 billion Canadian asset sale and repurchased $4.7 billion worth of shares during the quarter. By the end of 2026, the company intends to cut structural expenses by $2-3 billion. On November 4, 2024, RBC Capital raised Chevron Corporation's (NYSE:CVX) price target to $175 from $170, maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. Although there is still uncertainty surrounding the Hess (HES) deal, the company's remarks regarding peak Permian capex in 2024 should bode well for free cash flow into 2025 and beyond, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Its Q3 results included a strong operational performance that culminated in an earnings and cash flow beat relative to market expectations. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns 118,610,534 shares worth $17.47 billion as of Q3. Overall CVX ranks 5th on our list of the best American energy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Election 2024 live updates: Ministers fighting for seats; tallies show Gerry Hutch in contention; tight battle to decide biggest party

The first day of counting is drawing to a close with the number of seats filled surpassing 30 - those include the larger party leaders Simon Harris, Mary Lou McDonald and Micheál Martin. Counting is continuing in six constituencies. Both Harris and Martin have expressed their optimism that they will be part of any government formed in the coming weeks, although they look set to fall short of an majority. Meanwhile, the performance of Gerry Hutch has been the big talking point of the day. Could he be elected? Our writers give an update on the Dublin Central situation. [ Election 2024 key race alerts: We analyse the count contests that matter mostOpens in new window ] You can follow all of our counts in amazing detail, with really excellent tables, stats and graphic on The Irish Times Results Hub. As of now, 35 seats out of 174 have been filled. The final percentages will depend on the last few first counts to be held but it’s interesting to see that the order of the three larger parties from last night’s exit poll have been reversed. Fianna Fáil is the lead party with 21.5 per cent of support. Fine Gael has 20.7 per cent support. And Sinn Féin has 18.7 per cent. Labour and the Social Democrats are very close, both at about 4.7 per cent. The Greens managed to get 3 per cent of the vote but that might not translate into any seats. I did a run through all 43 constituencies to make a seat projection. As of now, my projections for seats are: Fianna Fáil: 49 Fine Gael: 40 Sinn Féin 38: Independents: 19 Social Democrats: 10 Labour: 8 Independent Alliance: 5 People Before Profit: 3 Aontú: 1 Green Party 1. There is a big health warning with that as the last seats will be very keenly contested, and I suspect Fianna Fáil’s total may slip a little on critical seats on the final counts. For example, I’ve projected three seats for the party in Carlow-Kilkenny but that might not materialise. Likewise, I have only assigned one to it in Mayo but it may end up getting two. Cork North West will be very close. So will Dublin Mid West where Fianna Fáil might lose out to combined transfers of centre-left parties and candidates. What looks a possibility at this stage is that Fianna Fáil will be the biggest party with Fine Gael marginally ahead of Sinn Féin. If these projections are correct Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will be close to a majority, but will probably seek a third party to give the Government stability. Thank you for staying with us during the course of the evening and night. We will be back early in the morning! Stephen Maguire reports: Pearse Doherty’s huge surplus has swept his running mate Padraic Mac Lochhlainn to the second seat in the five-seat Donegal. The Inishowen TD did not need too many of the 6,000 spare votes as he was close to the quota himself after Count 1. Vivienne Clarke reports: The Offaly count is concluded with Fianna Fail’s Tony McCormack and Fine Gael’s John Clendennen, both seasoned councillors, taking the final two seats, narrowly defeating Sinn Féin’s Aoife Masterson. In the seventh count, Mr Clendennen, with 8,627, had only 116 votes to spare over Ms Masterson who had 8,501. Tony McCormack was a little ahead at 9,151. David Forsythe writes: The leader of Independent Alliance Michael Collins has been elected in the three-seat Cork South West. The three outgoing TDs - the other two are Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns and Fianna Fáil Christopher O’Sullivan - are expected to be re-elected. Mr Collins total of 12,295 votes exceeded the quota of 11,824. Mr Collins said: “I’d like to pay tribute to my canvas team and the people of Cork South West who put their faith in me again.” He said he expected Independent Ireland to return to the Dáil with “two or three” extra TDs. He added: “Where Independent Ireland was on the paper we were strong and it looks at this present time that we could take between five and eight seats. If a party that had three TDs can return with six I’d be very pleased with that.” Could Gerry Hutch be elected? Well-known criminal remains in contention for Dáil seat in Dublin Central https://t.co/nPAWHfUEpm via @IrishTimes Stephen Farrell reports: Peter Burke of Fine Gael is elected after completion of long awaited first count. Counting adjourned until tomorrow morning. You can see the full results here. Burke won 17.56 per cent, getting 10,884 votes. Fianna Fáil’s Longford TD Joe Flaherty looks like he is in trouble, with Fine Gael set to gain a second seat through Michael Carrigy. Arthur Beesley reports: Fine Gael’s Frank Feighan topped the poll in the first Sligo-Leitrim count with 8,890 first-preference votes, leaving the incumbent TD 2,401 votes short of the quota. The result of the first count was declared by deputy returning officer Paraic O’Grady shortly after midnight, more than 15 hours after boxes were opened at 9am on Saturday. Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin came second with 7,764 votes, followed by Michael Clarke of Independent Ireland on 5,979 votes and Eamon Scanlon of Fianna Fáil with 5,913 votes. Kenny’s running mate Chris MacManus is on 5,173 votes. Scanlon running mates Edel McSharry is on 4,466 votes and Paddy O’Rourke is on 4,066 votes. Independent TD Marian Harkin is on 4,347 votes. Mr O’Grady adjourned the count until 9am on Sunday after eliminating Independent Diarmuid MacConville, Independent Ireland’s Caroline Corcoran and Party for Animal Welfare candidate Molly Candon. Cian O’Connell reports that Independent TD Seán Canney is the first to be elected in Galway East. Stephen Maguire reports: Pearse Doherty has amassed the highest number of first preferences in the State with almost 19,000 votes, over 6,000 above the quote in five-seat Donegal. As the second count gets underway, his surplus of 6,127 now being distributed. His running mate Pádraig Mac Lochlainn has an outside chance of getting in on Doherty’s surplus but it could be a long night at the Aura Leisure Centre in Letterkenny. Sinn Féin will take two seats with Fianna Fáil looking poised to take two with the final seat looking like a battle between Independents Thomas Pringle and Charles Ward. David Raleigh reports that veteran Fianna Fáil TD Willie O’Dea has been elected on the sixth count. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlavin and Kieran O’Donnell look set to be elected in later counts with a battle between five candidates for the last seat. Elisa O’Donovan of the Social Democrats looks like she has the slight advantage here. On the back of topping the poll in Limerick City, FF veteran Willie O’Dea says he is currently writing his memoirs to be published after he retires from political life - but first, tonight, after waiting on six counts to be reach the quota in this four-seater, he is going to the pub with his supporters to celebrate. Fianna Fáil candidates have finished in the top three positions in five-seat Carlow-Kilkenny, with a chance of getting all three elected. John McGuinness topped the poll, followed by Jennifer Murnane O’Connor and Peter ‘Chap’ Cleere. Sinn Féin’s two candidates have done exceptionally well despite neither being an elected representative. Fine Gael’s Catherine Callaghan is the front-runner of her party’s three candidates. Green Party Minister Malcolm Noonan with 4.18 per cent of the vote is not going to hold onto his seat on those figures. Latest results from Carlow-Kilkenny here. John Fallon reports: The first count has been finally announced in Galway West. Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell has done exceptionally well and has topped the pool with 8,164 votes, a little under 2,000 votes short of the quota of 10.047. The big surprise has been the poor showing of celebrity candidate Gráinne Seoighe who has won 2,929 votes (about 6 per cent) and will not be in the running for a seat. Her Fianna Fáil running mate, John Connolly, is in second position with 7,197 votes and looks like he will take a seat. Independents Catherine Connolly and Noel Grealish also look like they have polled strongly. Hildegarde Naughton looks the stronger of the two Fine Gael candidates.

Malachy Steenson has be eliminated. Gary Gannon is at 6,363 votes, Paschal Donohoe at 5,730, Gerard Hutch is at 3,733, Marie Sherlock is at 2,917, Mary Fitzpatrick is at 2,553 and Nease Hourigan is at 2,315. Counting adjourned for the night for Dublin Central and will resume at 10am. Hutch is currently almost 800 votes ahead of Sherlock and Steenson’s transfers will widen that gap. The only pathway for Sherlock is for transfers from Neasa Hourigan and Mary Fitzpatrick to tilt heavily in her direction. A thousand votes plus is still a big gap to make up in Dublin Central, especially with Gannon and Donohoe still in the race, and attracting transfers. Jack White reports: Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell received the majority of Neale Richmond’s transfers following the second count for Dublin Rathdown, though no candidates have been elected. Independent candidates Kevin Daly and Conor Murphy, and the National Party’s Garrett McCafferty have all been eliminated. Their votes are now being distributed among the 11 remaining candidates. Ms O’Connell remains in the lead with 6,573 votes, having received 198 of Mr Richmond’s 292 transfers. She is followed by Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan (5,943) who received 30 transfers, independent councillor Michael Fleming (4,394) who received 14 transfers and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney (4,281) who received four transfers. Green Party minister Catherine Martin is in fifth place with 4,161 votes after receiving 15 transfers. Dublin-Rathdown results here. Emmet Malone writes: It is all over in Dún Laoghaire where Richard Boyd-Barrett and Cormac Devlin have both exceeded the quota after Shane O’Brien’s votes were distributed, and Barry Ward, who was 2,480 votes ahead of Hugo Mills of the Social Democrats, was deemed to be elected without reaching the quota. They all join Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, who had become the first candidate elected to the new Dáil, about six hours ago.

Mr O’Callaghan secured 399 transfers with Fine Gael’s Emma Blain receiving 351, the second highest number. Labour leader Ivana Bacik secured 310 transfers from Ms O’Connell while Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan received 291. Green Party candidate Hazel Chu was the next highest recipient with 171 transfers. Mr O’Callaghan is now just 59 votes behind Ms Bacik who is in second place with Mr Geoghegan still on course to be first elected to the four-seat constituency.

Representing Tipperary North, he topped the poll - making his seventh consecutive General Election win. Asked if he will be talking to whoever forms the next government, and he replied: “Absolutely.” Mr Lowry, who met with outgoing Taoiseach Simon Harris before the election, added: “I’ve always been positive in my approach to politics.” He smiled as he dodged questions about what he talked about and what he hoped he could gain by supporting any government Mr Harris would be a part of or even lead. “I’m not in the business of saying,” he said. “Being successful in supporting a government is to know when to say nothing. “All I can say is that I have worked with Bertie Ahern, Brian Cowen, Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar and with Simon Harris. “It’s a case of, how shall I put it, knowing when to ask and you have to know when to ask.” On his Dail win, he added: “I am only as good as the supporters who made me.” Conor Gallagher reports: Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey has become the third and final TD elected in Meath West. She will join returning along with Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke, who topped the poll, and Aontú leader and returning TD, Peadar Tóibín, into the 34th Dáil following the completion of counting late on Saturday night. Ms Dempsey, the daughter of former Fianna Fáil minister Noel Dempsey, narrowly beat Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray in a fierce battle for transfers and surpluses. She received 17 per cent of first preference votes compared to Ms Murray’s 16 per cent. The contours of the race were obvious from the early afternoon when tallies showed Mr Tóibín and Mr Guirke all but certain to take a seat and either Ms Dempsey or Ms Murray in contention for the third. Former Fine Gael turned independent councillor Noel French, who received 11 per cent of first perferences was quickly out of the running while the remaining seven candidates hardly featured at all. Six of them polled at 1.5 per cent or less. Mr Guirke was the first candidate returned, repeating his poll-topping perforamce of 2020, albeit with a significantly reduced vote. His supporters hoisted him on their shoulders alongside a Tricolour and sang Oró, Sé Do Bheatha ‘Bhaile in celebration. “Absolutely delighted. After losing a big area of west Meath where I got 40 per cent of the poll, to come in here and top the poll,” Mr Guirke said.

Amazing work by the count staff here pic.twitter.com/iOSWyeSzJc Barry Roche reports: From Barry Roche, Cork Tanaiste and Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin has romped home on the first count in Cork South Central with over 4,000 votes to spare in his ninth election since he first won a Dáil seat in 1989. Martin polled 14,742 in 2002 when he polled 26.69 of the vote and he was just 226 votes short of that total when he came in on this occasion 14,526 confirming his status as the most popular Fianna Fail leader in Cork since Jack Lynch Martin’s huge surplus of 4075 looks like propelling running mate Seamus McGrath – brother of former Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath if not over then close to quota with McGrath polling a highly credible 7794 to take second spot. After Martin’s surplus was distributed after the first count, McGrath was at 9,940, only 500 votes short of the quota. Sinn Fein’s Donnachadh O Laoghaire looks poised to hold his seat with 6,947 while Fine Gael are set to hold Simon Coveney’s seat most likely through Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Jerry Buttimer who leads his running mate Shane O’Callaghan by 4407 to 3364. Aside from Martin’s storming home on the first count, the story of Cork South Central is that of Social Democrat Padraig Rice, a native of Camp in West Kerry, who looks to win the Soc Dems’ first seat in Cork city after he polled an impressive 5368. Former Lord Mayor of Cork, Independent Mick Finn is still in with a slim chance of the last seat after he polled 3,582 – ahead of Labour’s Laura Harmon and Sinn Fein’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid, Anna Daly of Aontu, Úna McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens.

Keep up to date with @IrishTimes live election blog pic.twitter.com/ydkyf1MDll Kevin O’Sullivan writes: On the election outcome, Sadhbh O’ Neill, who stood for Labour in Waterford, expressed dismay that climate change did not feature strongly in the debates and hustings. “It feels like the election took place inside a bubble of denial and delay. No matter who ends up forming a government, it is vital that Ireland acts to develop plans to help us prepare for weather extremes. “Candidates and parties should have been interrogated on how they plan to both adapt to and mitigate climate change in Ireland. “Even non-controversial areas of decarbonisation like bringing our public transport up to European norms were not addressed in any meaningful way by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. “That makes me very fearful of how these parties will tackle more challenging topics like data centres, high electricity costs and sustainable land use, because if the next government doesn’t act we’re all in big, big trouble.” Ms O’Neill is a noted environmental activist and was formerly a member of the Green Party. Arthur Beesley writes from Sligo: With the Sligo-Leitrim first count still awaited 13 hours after boxes were opened, Independent TD Marian Harkin has acknowledged she faces a struggle to retain her seat. Ms Harkin’s secured in region of 7.6 per cent of the first-preference vote, according to the tally, down from 11.5 per cent in the 2020 election. “We had hoped for better because we got such a positive response,” she said just before 10pm at the Sligo count centre. “What I’m hoping is that that positive response will translate into twos and threes. As I said earlier, there’s a pathway. It’s narrow and it’s slippy.” She faces a battle against Chris MacManus of Sinn Féin and Michael Clarke of Independent Ireland for the fourth and final seat. Tallies suggest the first three seats are likely to go to Fine Gael’s Frank Feighan, Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin and Eamon Scanlon of Fianna Fáil. Fiachra Gallagher reports that the Kildare North count has been suspended until 9am tomorrow. They are yet to get a first count. Emmet Malone writes: Sinn Fein’s Shane O’Brien has been eliminated in Dún Laoghaire after receiving just 100 of Ossian Smyth’s transfers and being overtaken by Hugo Mills of the Social Democrats who got 2,003. O’Brien’s departure from the race should be very good news for Richard Boyd-Barrett who got about 80 per cent of his transfers when he went out four years ago, enough to push the People Before Profit candidate well over the quota on that occasion. Fifty per cent would be more than enough to get Boyd Barrett over the line this time but if he somehow doesn’t make it, it’s hugely unlikely Hugo Mills will overtake him. The gap is 1,023. The count centre is filling up, meanwhile, with the other remaining candidates and their supporters as the process approaches its end. Barry Ward of Fine Gael has been receiving a lot of congratulations from well wishers including MEP Regina Doherty. Barry Andrews has also around the place showing support for Cormac Devlin. Both men also look set to be elected within the next hour. Neil Michael writes: Mattie McGrath had topped the poll in South Tipperary with 10,014 votes after the first count. But as it was just shy of the 10,270 quota, it now goes to a second count before his win can be confirmed. Five candidates were eliminated and their votes distributed. A last minute but unspecified issue has held up the first count of the Tipperary North constituency, where Michael Lowry has topped the poll. In Tipperary South, Michael Murphy (Fine Gael) looks poised to take the second seat with a three-way battle for the third seat between outgoing Sinn Féin TD Martin Browne, Fianna Fáil’s Imelda Goldsboro, and Independent Séamus Healy. Carl O’Brien writes: Taoiseach Simon Harris has been elected on the first count in Wicklow while Fianna Fáil TD and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is facing a battle to retain his seat. Mr Harris topped the poll with 16,869 votes, exceeding the 11,415 quota by more than 5,000 votes. Bray-based Sinn Féin TD John Brady is in second place (8,450 votes), followed by Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore (7,699). Both deputies look set to retain their seats. A tight race is unfolding for the final spot in the four-seat constituency between Stephen Donnelly (3,553), Independent candidate and former Fine Gael councillor Shay Cullen (3,232) and Fine Gael’s Edward Timmins (3,050). Mr Harris’s transfers look set to play a key role in deciding where the final seat goes. While a strong transfer rate to the Taoiseach’s Fine Gael running mate in west Wicklow is expected, tallies indicate significant numbers will also go to Donnelly who is based in the Taoiseach’s hometown of Greystones. Newtownmountkennedy-based Shay Cullen decided to stand as an independent after missing out on a place on the Fine Gael ticket. Independent Bray-based candidate Cllr Joe Behan is further behind in the contest (2,909) followed by sitting Green Party TD Steven Matthews (2,366) who looks set to lose his seat. Marie O’Halloran writes: Former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell has been eliminated after the fourth count in Dublin Bay South. Ms O’Connell ran as an independent and garnered a total of 1,956 votes. Poll topper James Geoghegan is on course to be elected first. He has 6,171 but he is still 1,800 votes short of the quota of 7,957.

Sarah Burns reports: The first count has come in for the ‘People’s Republic of Dublin South Central’. Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh has topped the poll with 4,497 first preferences, followed by Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh with 3,988 votes, Sinn Féin’s Máire Devine with 3,854 votes, the Social Democrats Jen Cummins with 3,347 votes, People Before Profit’s Hazel de Nortúin with 3,331 votes, Sinn Féin’s Daithí Doolan with 3,290 votes and Fine Gael’s Mary Seery Kearney with 3,056 votes. Independent Ireland candidate Michael Fitzmaurice has been elected on the first count, topping the poll. It looks like Claire Kerrane (Sinn Féin) and Martin Daly (Fianna Fáil) will fill the other two seats here. Fitzmaurice disclosed in an interview a short while ago that Daly was his family GP. It also means that two of the three TDS in the constituency will be from Co Galway, albeit both of them in parishes within a stone’s throw of Roscommon. Sarah Burns reports: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been elected on the third count in Dublin Central. Following the transfer of Sinn Féin’s Janice Boylan transfers, Gerard Hutch is at 3,295 votes, Labour’s Marie Sherlock at 2,521 votes, Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick at 2,446 votes. Jack White writes: Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond has been elected while the Green Party minister Catherine Martin was placed sixth following the first count for Dublin Rathdown. Mr Richmond received 10,044 votes against a quota of 9,752. He was followed by Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell (6,375), Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan (5,913), independent councillor Michael Fleming (4,380) and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney (4,277). The Green Party’s Catherine Martin came sixth in the four-seat constituency following the first count, receiving 4,146 first preference votes. She was narrowly behind Social Democrats’ candidate Sinéad Gibney. It was a significant fall from her 8,958 first preference votes in 2020, the highest number received that year. Mr Richmond’s surplus of 292 will be transferred tonight. Dublin Rathdown saw a turnout of 60.60 per cent, a slight reduction from 63.65 per cent in 2020. Following his election, Mr Richmond said he and councillor Maeve O’Connell were given a “very clear task” by Taoiseach Simon Harris to retain two seats for the party. “It looks like we will, but personally, obviously I’m chuffed, and hopefully we’ll see a lot more Fine Gael seats elected over the coming hours and days,” he said, anticipating the party to return more TDs than in 2020. “We ran as a really united ticket that delivered two seats for Fine Gael in Dublin Rathdown once again, even though many people said we couldn’t do it,” he said, adding that he expects Ms O’Connell to be elected on Sunday morning. Jack Horgan-Jones reports: Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has arrived to the RDS, delivering a stinging verdict on Sinn Féin while saying his party is “in the early days” of a very positive result. “Until a few days ago I heard many predictions of a very difficult election for Fine Gael, and that’s not going to happen,” he said. Asked about the performance of gangland figure Gerry Hutch, who has a definite pathway to a seat in Dublin Central as well, Mr Donohoe said that it was important to note the vast majority of people in Dublin Central had not voted for him. “We will have to reflect in due course regarding why he performed like he did, but the big picture today is one of the centre holding.” “At a time when incumbent governments all over Europe are struggling to get re-elected, the two larger parties within this government and in particular Fine Gael, are going to deliver a very strong performance.” Regarding Sinn Féin’s performance, he said it was “now very evident they are the weakest opposition party in Europe” Despite a cost of living crisis and the lingering effects of Covid, he said any gains for Sinn Féin would be minimal, accusing the party of being unable to answer basic questions on the campaign trail. “Their share of vote and any electoral gains they make will be amongs the weakest of any opposition party in Europe.” Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond has been elected following first count in Dublin Rathdown Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond has been elected following the first count for Dublin Rathdown, receiving 10,044 votes against a quota of 9,752 pic.twitter.com/GbxcMZHrGm Cian O’Connell writes: the second count is finished in Galway East. The big story from Galway East is that the 25 year-old chairman of Galway County Council has topped the poll, seemingly at the expense of outgoing Fianna Fáil TD Anne Rabbitte, who received just 4,056 first preference votes, over 6,000 short of the quota. It will come as a blow to the party. Ms Rabbitte is the current Minister of State for Disabilities and has held a high profile since first being elected to the Dáil in 2016. Treatment of workers in the care sector became a major issue during the election campaign after footage emerged of outgoing Taoiseach Simon Harris’ interaction with disability worker Charlotte Fallon in Cork. Concerns raised by Ms Fallon led to widespread criticism of the government’s handling of the care sector. If Ms Rabbitte is to lose her seat in Galway East, it will raise further questions on the issue. The minister will be hoping for a turnaround through transfers, but she faces a very difficult battle. Read the detailed breakdown on the Galway East Counts here. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been elected in Dublin Central on the third count. Carl O’Brien reports: Taoiseach Simon Harris said he is “very confident” that Fine Gael will have a “very significant role” to play in Government formation talks. Speaking at the count centre in his Wicklow constituency, he said that while it was difficult to say who will be the biggest party in the next Dáil, he was “cautiously optimistic and excited about the weeks ahead.” He said the Fine Gael parliamentary party which he will lead will be “massively different” with new TDs who will bring “new ideas and new perspective to Leinster House”. Mr Harris said it was clear the party “will gain seats” and “top the poll in at least 10 constituencies” and add second seats across a number of constituencies. “I think the people of Ireland have now spoken. We now have to work out exactly what they have said. That is going to take a little bit of time ... “We need to be patient in relation to that. Of course, my party will act responsibly in the days ahead,” he said. “I am really grateful to the Irish people for the mandate they have given me and my party.” In relation to Sinn Féin, he said there has been “so sign of a Sinn Féin surge” and claimed the party’s vote was likely to be down on the last election. “The two larger parties are likely to receive significant support from the electorate. So, definitely politics in Ireland has gotten much more fragmented,” he said. In relation to the performance of Gerard Hutch in the election, Mr Harris said the “people are sovereign” but said he believed he “wasn’t nailed on yet”. With 11 TDS already elected to the Dáil, our political editor Pat Leahy has projected that the two outgoing Coalition partners will have more than 80 seats and will be close to having the numbers to form a Government, albeit needing support. Here is Pat’s take: Projections for the vote share of the three biggest parties suggest that Fianna Fáil will win the largest share of votes, with 21.9 per cent of first preferences, with Fine Gael in second on 20.5 per cent and Sinn Féin in third place on 19.1 per cent. Those figures are subject to revision when first counts are all in but party analysts do not expect them to change substantially. Extrapolating seat numbers from those vote chare figures is notoriously tricky. But Fianna Fáil has some things working in its favour – including lots of incumbent candidates and strong transfers from Fine Gael. Most seat projections for the party put them somewhere in the mid-40s, with some suggesting nearer to 50, though party insiders play down the most optimistic scenarios. Fine Gael believes that it will be in the low 40s, anticipating favourable results in s amll number of place that would bring it over the 40 mark. If both these estimates are right, it will mean that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil between them will be in the mid-80s – not all that far away from the magic number of 88 which constitutes a majority in the next Dáil. But enough to need the support of either another party or a bunch of independents to form a Government with a workable majority. Johnny Guirke was elected on the third count in Meath West, having topped the poll. Supporters in the hall Trim GAA Club hoisted him on their shoulders alongside a Tricolour and sang Oró, Sé Do Bheatha Abhaile in celebration. “Absolutely delighted. After losing a big area of west Meath where I got 40 per cent of the poll, to come in here and top the poll,” Mr Guirke said. “I’m delighted for the Sinn Féin team, I’m delighted for the party and I’m delighted for myself and my family.” Mr Guirke said he intends to prioritise local issues in the 34th Dáil, including the building of the proposed Navan rail line. “I work hard on the ground. I’m not one of these that looks for media attention. My strengths are on the ground and the people have honoured that today.” On his party’s performance nationwide, he said: “If you said a couple of weeks ago we are where we are today, we’d have taken the hand off you. I think we’re flying across the country.” The counting is continuing with Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín looking likely to be returned next on the back of the transfers independent councillor Noel French, who has been eliminated. That leaves Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey (17 per cent) and Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray (16 per cent) in a fierce battle for the final seat. Just 275 votes separate the women.

Labour’s Ged Nash is polling third with 7,594 votes. However, no candidate has reached the quota in Louth in the first count, which requires 10,623 votes to be elected. Others following closely behind include Fianna Fáil’s Erin McGreehan at 5,772 votes, and Fine Gael candidate Paula Butterly with 5,646 votes. But John McGahon, who has been involved in controversy over a 2018 assault, now looks unlikely to win a seat for Fine Gael with just 4,021 first preference votes. One candidate, independent David Carroll, was eliminated, with his 40 votes to be redistributed. Taoiseach Simon Harris has just said that it’s unlikely that McGahon will be elected and Paula Butterly is his party’s best chance of winning a seat in Louth, based on the first count returns. Sorcha Pollak writes: Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly have both been elected to the Dublin West constituency. Mr Chambers secured 9,446 first preference votes, far exceeding the quota of 7,373. Mr Donnelly also exceed the quota on the first count, securing 7,731 votes. The total poll for Dublin West was 44,593 out of an electorate of 78,034, while 357 spoiled votes were registered. The total valid poll was 44,236.

Ms Currie is expected to benefit substantially from Mr Chambers’ transfers. PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is sitting in fourth place, with 3,552 first preference votes, while Green Party Leader Roderic O’Gorman is holding on to fifth place with 2,909.

He is followed by his running mate, Mark Ward TD, who garnered 5,323 first preferences and who will pick up a substantial number of Ó Broin’s almost 2,000 transfers. Emer Higgins (Fine Gael) is coming in third on 4,798 votes, followed closely by Fianna Fáil’s Shane Moynihan on 4,746. Sitting TD Gino Kenny, People Before Profit, with 2,608 votes is trailing behind Fine Gael’s Vicky Casserly (3,723), Independent Paul Gogarty (3,646) and the Social Democrats’ Eoin Ó Broin (2,907).

She said: “I am very pleased with how I have done.” However, Senator Garvey conceded that the gap between herself and Sinn Féin candidate, Donna McGettigan was too big to make up. She said: “I will do well on transfers but I don’t think I will do well enough. I cannot see myself passing her out.” Jennifer Bray sent us this post on X Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik says hers is a party of “deep roots and green shoots” - says “we are serious about delivering change.” She says govt formation talks will start next weeks and she will first speak to the left @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/lkXfAHlp3w From Barry Roche, in Cork: Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has romped home on the first count in Cork South Central with over 4,000 votes to spare in what is his second ever vote since he first won a Dáil seat in 1989. Martin polled 14,742 in 2002 when he polled 26.69 of the vote and he was just 226 votes short of that total when he came in on this occasion 14,526 confirming his status as the most popular Fianna Fáil leader in Cork since Jack Lynch. Martin’s huge surplus of 4,075 looks like propelling running mate Seamus McGrath – brother of former Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath, if not over then close to quota with McGrath polling a highly credible 7794 to take second spot. Sinn Féin’s Donnachadh Ó Laoghaire looks poised to hold his seat with 6,947 while Fine Gael are set to hold Simon Coveney’s seat most likely through Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Jerry Buttimer who leads his running mate Shane O’Callaghan by 4407 to 3364. Aside from Martin’s storming home on the first count, the story of Cork South Central is that of Social Democrat Padraig Rice, a native of Camp in West Kerry, who looks to win the Soc Dems’ first seat in Cork City after he polled an impressive 5368. Former Lord Mayor of Cork, Independent Mick Finn is still in with a slim chance of the last seat after he polled 3,582 – ahead of Labour’s Laura Harmon and Sinn Féin’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid, Anna Daly of Aontú, Una McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens. Returning Officer, Martin Harvey and his staff have begun the second count where they re-examine all Martin’s 14,526 papers to enable them to allocate his 4075 surplus to the remaining 21 candidates on a proportionate basis. Emmet Malone writes: Barry Ward has picked up about 60 per cent of Jennifer Carroll MacNeill’s 551 surplus in dun Laoghaire and is just under 2,500 off joining his running mate in the next Dáil. Carroll MacNeill said she was pleased to see her running mate, Barry Ward, in a strong position to take a second seat for the party in a constituency where it is generally regarded as having let one slip through its fingers last time around. “Two weeks ago we had a poll that showed me in a very, very, very, very strong position in the constituency. So we worked within our Fine Gael community to try to balance out that vote,” Ward finishing third on the first count, initially 2,797 off the quota, she said, had shown the strategy had worked. Elsewhere, she said the party was in contention for two seats in a number of constituencies and could be in for a better day than the exit poll might have suggested but, she said, “I think the best analysis I’ve seen is, ‘there’s a long way to go’.” Regarding her own election, said she was “really thrilled” to be elected again for the constituency and “really proud to be one of the small number of women who will be elected on first counts across the country”. Fianna Fáil’s Cormac Devlin picked up 116 second preference from Carroll MacNeill, the only other candidate to gain in any way significantly. Ossian Smyth picked up 23 transfers and still looks to have a huge fight on his hands to avoid being the constituency’s big loser this time around. Michael O’Doherty (Independent) and Cathy Lynch (The Irish People) are now being eliminated on 344 and 650 votes respectively. We have a comprehensive results hub on The Irish Times website including tables from each constituency. Sarah Burns reports: The first count completed in Dublin Central, and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has topped the poll with 6,389 votes. However, McDonald has just fallen short of the quota and did not get elected on the first count. The other dramatic development has been the showing of Gerard Hutch who is currently lying in fourth place, some 600 votes ahead of Marie Sherlock of Labour. She was followed by Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe with 5,493 votes, the Social Democrat’s Gary Gannon (4,353 votes), Independent Gerard Hutch (3,098 votes), Labour’s Marie Sherlock (2,465 votes), Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick got 2,344 vote and the Green Party’s Neasa Hourigan (1,952 votes). Independent Malachy Steenson received 1,602 first preferences, followed by People Before Profit’s Eoghan Ó Ceannabháin at 1,471, Independent Clare Daly with 1,317 and Sinn Féin’s Janice Boylan with 1,257. Vivienne Clarke is in our count centre in Offaly. Independent TD Carol Nolan has topped the poll in Offaly with 8,282 votes, a little over 1,000 short of the quota of 9,347. Fianna Fáil’s Tony McCormack (6,349) and Fine Gael’s John Clendennen (6,580) look favourites to take the remaining two seats, even though Aoife Masterson of Sinn Féin is also in contention with 6,211 votes. Full Offaly results here. Ellen O’Riordan writes: With 8,820 first preference votes, first time candidate Brian Brennan, a hotelier, has topped the poll as Fine Gael’s sole candidate in this new, three-seat constituency. Senator Malcolm Byrne – one of two Fianna Fáil candidates here – is a close second with 8,311 votes. In third is Sinn Féin councillor and Gaelscoil teacher Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin on 7,719. Fianna Fáil’s second candidate, Pat Kennedy, comes in a bit behind in fourth, with 5,478 votes. The 648 votes of Independent Ireland candidate Frances Lawlor and 168 votes of independent Lise-Marie Nolan will now be distributed, as they have been eliminated. Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan has topped the poll in Dublin Bay South with 6,060 votes in the first count, almost 2,000 short of the quota of 7,957. Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik is second on 5,684 with Jim O’Callaghan of Fianna Fáil in third with 5,536. Chris Andres of Sinn Féin lies fourth with 4,875 with Fine Gael’s second candidate Emma Blain amassing 4,102 votes. The Green Party seat looks at risk as Hazel Chu has 3,250 votes, which will make it difficult for her to retain the seat. The new Social Democrats candidate Eoin Hayes is ahead of her at 3,615 votes. Kate O’Connell, who stood as an independent, received 1,772 votes. The new three-seat constituency will have a new TD. Veteran Fine Gael councillor Willie Aird is to be elected at this first attempt at the Dáil with 9,269 votes. He was first elected as a councillor in 1979. Sitting Fianna Fáil TD Sean Fleming will be comfortably elected and is sitting at 8,123 votes. Brian Stanley, who left Sinn Féin in controversial circumstances, amassed 6,782 votes with a buffer of almost 2,000 votes over the Sinn Féin candidate, Maria McCormack, who garnered 4,914 votes. Darragh O’Brien of Fianna Fáil has topped the poll in Dublin Fingal East with 8,906 votes in the first count, some 500 votes short of the quota. There is a gap of over 3,000 votes between him and the next three candidates: Anne Graves of Sinn Féin, Duncan Smith of Labour and Alan Farrell of Fine Gael. All three are grouped between 5,379 and 5,450. The last two seats will therefrom be determined on transfers, and sitting TD Alan Farrell will find himself in a real battle to hold on to to his seat ahead of Sinn Féin. Sorcha Pollak writes: Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers, who is on track to top the poll in the Dublin West constituency, says he expects his party to “exceed 40 seats” in the general election. Speaking ahead of the first official count, the outgoing Minister for Finance and Fianna Fáil director of elections said it was “clear” his party would exceed the exit poll. “We’re in strong position for gains in many parts of the country, and obviously we have to wait the final counts and the general counting over the next 24 hours,” he said. Fianna Fáil is “in a strong position” and there is “real optimism in the party about possible gains”. Asked whether he would like to be reappointed as Minister for Finance in the next Dáil, Mr Chambers said the conversation was “not about positions” but “about the substance of policies”. “I’m happy to play whatever role I’m asked to say if we form a Government,” he said. Our colleague Jack White recorded Catherine Martin as she arrived at the count centre. She says that she is “very disappointed” with the party’s performance and says her sense it is the old story of the smaller party in Government suffering. She said the party has really delivered this time. She maintained that Roderic O’Gorman and Ossian Smyth remained in contention for the last seats in “very tight” contests. She also said she was still in a battle in Dublin Rathdown. Speaking to reporters at the Dublin Rathdown count in the last few minutes, Catherine Martin said it has been “a very disappointing day for the Green Party.” pic.twitter.com/mc4sAevKtG From David Raleigh: The Fine Gael Minister for Higher Education has been elected on the first count in Limerick county. He won 11,563 votes, some 200 votes above the quota of 11,385. It is likely that the two other seats in the three-seater will be filled by the incumbents, Niall Collins of Fianna Fáil (9,284) and Richard O’Donoghue of Independent Alliance (10,540). The next nearest candidate is Joanne Collins from Sinn Féin on 6,006. Jennifer Bray writes: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her “first port of call” when the votes are counted will be to reach out to parties on the left. Speaking in the RDS, McDonald said she felt her party had performed “very well” in the 2024 general election. “The first thing I want to say is to acknowledge every single person right across this state who came out to vote for Sinn Féin. You have given us, again, a powerful and strong mandate and we understand the trust you have placed in us to make life better for you and we are determined to do just that. This has been an incredible performance by all of our candidates. “Over a short number of weeks we have achieved a result that many people a few weeks ago would have thought was impossible, so thank you, thank you to everyone who voted for us. I said in the course of the campaign that I believed another five years of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is bad news for our society, our communities, for families who are struggling, for our housing crisis and nobody should forget the record homeless number we saw on election day itself. “We are now at a really important decision point for Irish society and politics, and we need change. We intend, when the votes are counted, and when we know the lie of the land, that we will be talking to people about Government.” McDonald said she felt her party had done “very very well.” “We have now confirmed that we have broken the political mould in this state. Two party politics is gone, it has been consigned to the dust bin of history. The question now arises for us, what do we do with that?” “The counts are still under way. We know we are in play in a number of constituencies: five, six, maybe seven. Other parties of the left similarly have secured a mandate. My first port of call will be with those parties.” Jade Wilson writes: Louth is now 100 per cent tallied. Topping the poll is incumbent Ruairí Ó Murchú (SF) at 13.52 per cent, followed by local councillor Joanna Byrne (SF): 13.03 per cent. Then Labour’s Ged Nash, who is at 12.02 per cent followed by Erin McGreehan (FF): 8.97 per cent, Paula Butterly (FG) at 8.83 per cent, and ‘local celebrity’ candidate, Alison Comyn (FF) at 7.78 per cent. On these figures it looks unlikely that John McGahon, on 6.21 per cent, will become a TD. Incumbent Sligo-Leitrim Fine Gael TD Frank Feighan believes his party will form the next Government with Fianna Fáil but left the door open for them to coalesce with any of Labour, the Social Democrats or Independents. After scraping into the Dáil on the 15th Sligo-Leitrim count in 2020, Mr Feighan expects swifter election this time out. The final tally put him leading the pack at 15.8 per cent, although the formal result of the first count is still some hours away. “It’s a great honour to be elected TD for Sligo-Leitrim-south Donegal,” Mr Feighan said at the count centre. “It’s too early to comment but it looks like it may be a good election for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the numbers will dictate what Government,” he said. “I think the two main parties are there. After that I don’t know will it be Labour or Soc Dems or Independents. That will be a matter for people higher up in my party.” Incumbent Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny is well-placed to return to the Dáil, as is former Fianna Fáil TD Eamon Scanlon. “I’ll be hopeful that if things fall right for me that I will be able to hang in,” Mr Scanlon said. “I think we’re holding up,” he said of Fianna Fáil’s performance. Independent Ireland candidate Michael Clarke is in contention for the fourth and final seat. But Sinn Féin believes a strong showing in Sligo for Chris MacManus gives it a chance of winning a second seat. Conor Gallagher writes: The first count in Meath West has been completed with no candidates reaching the quota and six being eliminated. Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke remains in poll position with 8,604 first preference votes followed closely by Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín on 7,563. Both men look all but certain to retain their seats in the three-seat constituency. Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey (6,535) and Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray (6,164) are in a battle for the final seat. Former Fine Gael turned independent councillor Noel French in fifth on 3,969, followed by Ronan Moore of the Social Democrats on 2,542. Half the field were eliminated on the first count and their second preferences will now be distributed. They include Seamus McMenamin (Green Party), Ben Gilroy (Liberty Republic) and Sandy Gallagher (Labour). Just under 58 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot. There were 230 spoiled votes. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill has been elected on the first count in Dún Laoghaire with 11,685 votes. She narrowly exceeded the quota of 11.134. Cormac Devlin of Fianna Fáil is in second place (8,831 votes) with Fine Gael’s second candidate Barry Ward lying third with 8,337. People Before Profit’s leader Richard Boyd-Barrett has 6,795 votes and looks poised to take one of the four seats. As of now the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth with 4,297 votes looks like he will lose his seat unless he gathers transfers strongly from other candidates and stays ahead of other candidates of the centre-left. That looks unlikely. A gain for Fine Gael looks likeliest here. Martin Wall writes: Arriving at the Fingal East count he indicated he would like to continue in the housing portfolio. “This is the start of really significant chapter of Fianna Fáil in Dublin In Dublin in particular we are doing well. We will retain what we have and possible gain another three or four additional seat.” “We worked very hard over the last four and a half years to make our country better.” “If fortunate to be part of next Government, I will serve in whatever capacity I am asked to serve in.” “We are making progress in housing. We have a lot more work to do in housing and I would love to be part of that. But that is above my station.” Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald has arrived in the RDS to some pretty loud cheers and a wild scramble. What it’s like being in a scrum for Mary Lou McDonald.. @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/hmbqjhvBBS It is looking like a good day for the Soc Dems. Deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan indicates that his party is open to talking to arch rivals Labour about government formation pic.twitter.com/O3Akx44j6T Sinn Féin’s Johnny Guirke has topped the poll in Meath West with 8,604 votes, less than 1,000 short of the quota of 9,427. The second placed candidate is Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín who has 7,563. Fianna Fáil Aisling Dempsey is at 6,535 votes ahead of Linda Murray from Fine Gael who is at 6,164 votes. There will be a battle for the third seat between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with the transfers of Independent Noel French, who got nearly 4,000 votes, and Ronan Moore of the Social Democrats who received 2,542 votes. Carl O’Brien writes: The Social Democrats want to go into Government if the party can secure commitments on key policy areas, the party’s childcare spokesperson Jennifer Whitmore TD said. The party, which hopes to secure at least 10 seats – up from six in the last election – may have a crucial role to play in Government formation talks. “We have been really clear from the get-go: we want to go into Government, but we’re not going to go in just to make up the numbers,” Ms Whitmore said. “If we go in, it is to make real change and achieve real change.” The party has “five non-negotiables” which it would bring into any Government formation talks. They include 50,000 affordable homes; a public childcare system; the roll-out of Sláintecare; a minister for disabilities; delivering on climate change commitments. “We want to make sure we can deliver,” she said. Ms Whitmore looks set to be reelected with a larger personal vote in Wicklow and is set to take third seat in the four-seat Wicklow constituency, according to tallies. What a battle it’s turning out to be. And a slow one. By this time four years ago, the first constituency in the State, Galway East, had already declared its first count – done at about 3.30pm. We are an hour later than that and still no sign of a first count. We are also getting indications from the tallies that the order of the first three parties may be reversed from last night’s exist polls with indications that Fianna Fáil will finish first, Fine Gael second and Sinn Féin third. That said, they were close last night and they are still very close. I was talking to Pat Leahy last night just after our exit poll was published and he said his sense was the Fianna Fáil vote was perhaps a little understated – and he was right. It’s an intriguing battle. All of the parties will lose a few seats but all will make gains with Fianna Fáil poised to be the biggest party in terms of seats, but not too far ahead of Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. The other big stories. Despite getting close to 4 per cent the Greens could end up losing all their 12 seats, almost a worse calamity than 2011. The Social Democrats has done really well and Labour also look like they will make some gains. And then there is the story that will become a headline not just here but abroad ... the possible election of Gerard Hutch to Dáil Éireann. First count from Fingal West coming in now. No one elected but SF’s Louise O’Reilly topped the poll with 6,965 votes – 565 short of the quota of 7,530. Three candidates including Ben Gilroy have been eliminated and their votes will be distributed now. Labour’s Robert O’Donoghue has 5,044, Fine Gael’s Grace Boland 4,583 and Fianna Fáil’s Lorraine Lee-Clifford 4,417. The Carlow/Kilkenny constituency’s final tally indicates that Fianna Fáil’s John McGuiness is likely to top the poll with just more than 9,000 first preference votes and 14 per cent of the vote. Suzanne Pender reports that McGuinness is followed by his Fianna Fáil running mates Jennifer Murnane O’Connor on 7,541 or 11.8 per cent and Peter “Chap” Cleere 6,660 or 10.4 per cent. Fine Gael’s Catherine Callaghan is next, according to tallies, at 6,223 or 9.7 per cent, followed by Sinn Féin’s Áine Gladney Knox at 6,008 or 9.4 per cent of the vote. The tallies indicate that Fine Gael candidates Michael Doyle is at 4,648 or 7.2 per cent while David Fitzgerald is at 4,359 or 6.8 per cent The Green Party’s Malcolm Noonan looks in real danger of loosing his seat with 2,664 or 4.2 per cent while Sinn Féin, with a second candidate Natasha Newsome Drennan on 5,037 or 7.9 per cent, looks likely to hold the seat vacated by MEP Kathleen Funchion. Tallies appear to show that FF will win two seats but are in with a strong chance of securing a third, FG should hold the seat vacated by John Paul Phelan, while Sinn Féin look set to retain its seat. However, with very little separating the top nine candidates, the transfers of the remaining 11 candidates on the ballot paper will determine a lot. You may have noticed that our seat count currently stands at one, with Fianna Fáil allocated that solitary seat. You haven’t missed any first count completions and no TDs have been elected yet. The one in question is Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl who was automatically elected. We are already running behind the timings of the 2020 general election. Last time out the first seat was filled just after 3pm with Galway East doing the honours. It is now 4:20pm with no TDs elected yet. Tallies indicate that Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty will romp home in Donegal with 19,213 first votes with a quota of 12,959. With 99 per cent of Sligo-Leitrim boxes tallied, TDs Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin and Frank Feighan of Fine Gael are well placed for re-election. Former Fianna Fáil TD Eamon Scanlon has good prospects of returning to the Dáil, writes Arthur Beesley. Independent TD Marian Harkin has not polled well, leaving Independent Ireland candidate Michael Clarke well positioned. However, a strong showing in Sligo town for Chris MacManus of Sinn Féin means he may be in contention for a second party seat as left-wing candidates are eliminated. The 99 per cent tally shows Feighan at 15.8 per cent, although he lacks a running mate for Fine Gael transfers. Kenny is at 13.6 per cent, with Mr MacManus at 9.1 per cent. Mr Scanlon has 10.4 per cent, followed by running mates Edel McSharry at 7.8 per cent and Paddy O’Rourke at 7.2 per cent. Ms Harkin’s vote has dropped to 7.6 per cent, according to this tally, down from 11.5 per cent in the 2020 election. Mr Clarke is at 10.5 per cent. Sinn Féin is potentially on target to secure three seats in the five-seater Cavan-Monaghan constituency for the first time in the party’s history, writes Seanin Graham. The final tally of first preference votes put Sinn Féin poll topper Matt Carthy in first place with 13.55 per cent (9371 votes) followed by party colleague, councillor Cathy Bennett, at 10.03 per cent (6936 votes). Bennett, a theatre manager in Monaghan town, fist-pumped a supporter when tally results appeared on a screen at Cavan Leisure Centre. Fine Fáil’s Brendan Smith – and former incumbent – is in third place with 9.58 per cent (6628) followed closely by Sinn Féin’s Pauline Tully at 9.36 per cent (6478). Fifth place is Fianna Fáil Senator and former Garda Robbie Gallagher. Sinn Féin took a political gamble fielding an unprecedented three candidates in this border constituency and much now depends on transfers. Last time around, Tully was elected on the second count following transfers from her running mate, Carthy. The shock departure of Fine Gael Minister Heather Humphreys – who held a seat since 2011 – has the party pinning its hopes on her protégé, Monaghan councillor and undertaker, David Maxwell. However, Maxwell came sixth, at 8.86 per cent (6129 votes). Good news for our man in Waterford Kevin O’Sullivan as the First count is racing ahead. Based on 54,014 (estimated) total votes the quota expected to be circa 10,742 with 58 per cent turnout. The completed tally has David Cullinane (SF) at 11,835 1st prefs (22.4 per cent) and he is set to be elected on the first count; second and third seats look safe for Senator John Cummins (FG) at 10,203 (19.3 per cent); Mary Butler (FF) at 9,894 (18.7 per cent). The last seat looks like a dogfight between Conor McGuinness (SF) at 5,727 (10.8 per cent) and Matt Shanahan (Ind) at 5,218 (9.9 per cent) but don’t rule out Mary Roche (Soc Dems) at 2,631 (5 per cent). While last seat is probably between McGuinness and Shanahan, Roche is expected to be transfer-friendly among parties of left including Marc O Cathaisagh of the Greens - with 1,635 1st prefs (3.1 per cent). It may not be enough to challenge for last seat and if eliminated her votes are expected to benefit Shanahan. The complete tally for the four seat Clare constituency has Senator Timmy Dooley (FF) comfortably topping the poll in Clare. According to Gordon Deegan, the tally of the 180 boxes has the east Clare senator set to return to the Dail after missing out in 2020 on 11,041 tallied first preferences - or 18.29 per cent of the vote - which will leave him around 900 votes shy of the expected quota of around 12,000 votes. Outgoing deputy, Cathal Crowe (FF) is expected to return to the Dail with 13.69 per cent of the vote in a seat gain for Fianna Fail with 8,264 tallied votes in a strong showing for FF. First time General Election candidate, Cllr Joe Cooney (FG) will secure a seat for Fine Gael while Donna McGettigan (SF) is favourite to secure the fourth seat on 12.44 per cent of the vote. A member of Clare Co Council, Cllr McGettigan lies 2,281 tallied votes ahead of nearest competitor, Leonora Carey (FG) who has 5,228 tallied first preferences. Outgoing Independent TD, Violet Anne Wynne has polled only 286 tallied votes and looks likely to be eliminated after the first count. The former Sinn Fein candidate was the story of the 2020 General Election in Clare when she topped the poll taking 15.11 per cent of the first preference vote. The final tally shows FF with 38 per cent of first preferences with FG having 25 per cent followed by SF on 12 per cent. The first count in Galway West is expected “around tea-time’” and when is tea time in Galway West? Well, John Fallon has been told by one experienced member of the counting staff that itmeans “sometime between five and half-seven”. We’re glad we could clear that up. With tallies now complete in Longford-Westmeath there has been a lot of movement at the top of the leaderboard, writes Stephen Farrell. Peter Burke (FG) has moved into first position, followed by Robert Troy (FF) in second and Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran (Ind) in third. Slipping down to fourth position is Micheál Carrigy (FG), with Sorca Clarke (SF) holding fifth position. Also moving down the rankings is sitting TD, Joe Flaherty (FF) who is almost 1800 first preference votes adrift of Clarke and is certainly in a battle to retain his seat. According to the tallies Burke is on 17.7 per cent of the vote with 10,798 votes, followed by Troy on 8,031 votes (13.2 per cent) and Moran who is on 7,992 votes (13.1 per cent). Carrigy, who was flying high in pole position earlier on, has achieved 6,866 votes (11.3 per cent) and is only 27 votes ahead of Clarke. Apathy amongst people in the urban areas has been an issue. “No matter what the results today there will be a strong Green Party in Ireland,” Eamon Ryan has said this afternoon. “We have deep roots in the community and it’s a very distinct political philosophy and I think there is still space for that in Irish politics, for sure.” Mr Ryan said he did not believe his decision to retire, and the timing of his announcement in June this year, had affected the party’s showing. “Unfortunately – and this is just one of those days – we didn’t get the number of votes,” he said. “We’ll look back and see what are the lessons, and what can we learn and what can we do differently. It’s just one of those days when we didn’t have a good day.” Final tally figures show Fine Gael farmer Willie Aird from Portlaoise set to top the poll in Laois, with over 9,000 first preferences, says Carmel Hayes. Sitting TDS Seán Fleming (FF) and Brian Stanley (Ind) look set to take the remaining posts in the three-seat constituency, with Fleming tallying at 7,923 and Stanley at 6,514. While down on his poll-topping performance for Sinn Féin in 2020, Stanley is well placed to retain the seat as an Independent following his controversial departure from the party in October. Sinn Féin’s new candidate Maria McCormack is doing well on 4,712, according to the final tallies but will require huge transfers to have any hope of outrunning her former party colleague. Is this Michael Healy Rae having his say on social media? https://t.co/RMjrQbivGa pic.twitter.com/0COeAEm0Pj Barry Roche has an update from Cork where returning officer Martin Harvey is predicting they will have a first count in Cork North Central at around 6pm. Looking at the tallies, it doesn’t seem likely anyone is going to be elected on the first count in the five seater. Doing a quick tot on the tallies, some 57,055 people voted in Cork North Central – and doing the math, that should mean a quota around 9,509 – which means even the front runners, Padraig O’Sullivan (FF) and Tommy Gould (SF) on 7,470 and 7,129 are each over 2,000 votes shy. It could be a long night in Cork North Central and Cork South Central is likely to be even longer as Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin is set to comfortably clear the quota, meaning count staff will have to recount his estimated 14,000 plus first preference to distribute his surplus proportionately. It is neck and neck in Cork East with three candidates on 12 per cent according to the final tally, reports Liz Dunphy. First time candidate Mark Stanton will be one of the first elected in Cork East for Fine Gael. The 32-year-old from Midleton looks likely to take the seat from his father, long serving TD and former Minister of State David Stanton who has stepped down. Fianna Fáil’s James O’Connor, who was the youngest TD in the 33rd Dáil, and Sinn Fein’s Pat Buckley, who topped the poll in the last general election, are both also on 12 per cent. Fianna Fail councillor Deridre O’Brien and Fine Gael councillor Noel McCarthy are on 11 per cent. But Social Democrats – and former Green Party councillor - Liam Quaide is also still in the running for a seat, depending on transfers, as is Independent and former Fianna Fáil councillor William O’Leary who are both on 10 per cent. Independent Mary Linehan Foley, former Fianna Fail councillor and county mayor, is on 8% Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are both on 23% of the vote; ‘Others’ which are essentially independents, are on 27%; Sinn Féin is on 13%; and the Social Democrats are on 10%. The Green Party is on 3%. In the four seat constituency, two of the incumbents are not challenging for their seats. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers is safely on track to secure the Dublin West’s first seat and be elected by 4pm today, writes Sorcha Pollak. It’s expected most of his transfers, numbering around 3,000 votes, will be divided between his running mate Lorna Nolan and Fine Gael’s Emer Currie. Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly is due to clinch the constituency’s second seat on first preferences, while Ms Currie is expected to be elected to the third seat on the second count. Her transfers are forecast to go to the Green Party’s Roderic Gorman who is fighting to secure the 5th seat in the constituency. PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger remains comfortably in fourth place, while Labour’s John Walsh and Aontú's Ellen Troy’s are currently sitting in joint sixth place. It is looking like a good day for the Soc Dems. Deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan indicates that his party is open to talking to arch rivals Labour about government formation pic.twitter.com/O3Akx44j6T Green Party Minister of State Joe O’Brien has acknowledged that he will not be returning to the next Dail, writes Martin Wall. Speaking at the Fingal West count centre in north Dublin the junior minister at Department of Rural and Community Development and at the Department of Social Protection said: “Clearly I have lost my seat anyway. " He said the key issue was the re-drawing of the constituency . The previous five-seat Dublin Fingal has now been broken into two three-seat constituencies, Fingal East and Fingal West. “I lost over half of my base and then the tide was out. The combination of those things was going to make it difficult.” Mr O’Brien said he hoped the Green Party was not wiped out completely. “We are under pressure everywhere but I hope we hold on to a few seats so that the things we got done in the last four and a half years do not slip away in the next Dail.” “We knew going in four or five years ago that there was a strong chance that a bunch of us would lose out seats, which made us extra foused on getting things done. We knew that risk. We had hoped our level of achievement would push that back. Maybe it will. We have to see how things pan out.” Paul Donnelly has said his party should be open to “talking to whomever” when it comes to Government formation, reports Sorcha Pollak The Sinn Féin TD, who topped the poll in 2020 and is on track to secure the second seat in Dublin West, said the constituency’s third, fourth and fifth seats would “go down to a couple of 100 votes”. Once the party has a clearer idea of how many seats it has nationally, then the talks can begin, he said. “I think people should be open to talking to whomever, because it’s about the people. And the people speak in the in the general elections, they give their voice, and it’s up to us to make sure that that voice is heard.” Mr Donnelly said it had been a “tough campaign” but that canvassers had succeeded in convincing people “that there is a different way, and that we can change the way that we run this country, and we can change it in terms of housing, in terms of health and education.” “Across the state, there are opportunities for Sinn Féin, those towards fourth, fifth seats, which we didn’t take the last time. We ran a very important campaign in terms of giving people choice.” In Louth, a 5-seater, it is looking like at least 2 Sinn Féin, 1 Labour so far. Other 2 still too close to call. First count a way off yet in the constituency with the longest ballot in the country (24 candidates). The Social Democrats are set to top the poll in Dublin Bay North based on the tally estimate of 15 per cent of the vote for their housing spokesman Cian O’Callaghan, writes Marie O’Halloran. Sinn Féin TD Denise Mitchell is in a comfortable second place with 14 per cent, down from her whopping 29.8 per cent in 2020 but with a running mate this time around, the party is on 20 per cent. Fianna Fáil’s Tom Brabazon is on 10 per cent of the tally and 18 per cent in total for the party’s two candidates. Fine Gael’s Naoise Ó Muirí is in fourth place on 9 per cent followed jointly by Fianna Fáil’s Deirdre Heney and Fine Gael’s Aoibhinn Tormey, both on 8 per cent. Independent Barry Heneghan and Sinn Féin’s Micheál MacDonncha are both on 6 per cent, while Labour’s Shane Folan and Aontú's James Morris both have 4 per cent of the tally. Green Party candidate David Healy, People Before Profit’s Bernard Mulvany and Independent John Lyons are all on 3 per cent. Early predictions suggest seats for Cian O’Callaghan (SocDem), Denise Mitchell (Sinn Féin), Tom Brabazon (FF) and Naoise Ó Muirí (FG) with a battle for the fifth seat, mainly between Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Independent Barry Heneghan. It looks like a very difficult mountain to climb for Labour’s Shane Folan to keep the seat held by the party’s new MEP Aodhán Ó Riordáin and for Independent John Lyons without phenomenal transfers. Tough day for the outgoing TD. Former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan on a poor election for his party: “It’s been a hard day for us but we’re resilient and we will come back”. pic.twitter.com/wvDXy0ljNi Barry Roche has the latest from Cork. With over 80 per cent of votes in Cork South Central tallied, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin is on course to be elected on the first count with almost 25 per cent of first preference with running mate Seamus McGrath on 8.8 per cent and Sinn Fein’s Donnachadh O’Laoighaire on 11.5 per cent set to follow him home. The final two seats look to be between Padraig Rice of the Social Democrats on 9 per cent and Jerry Buttimer of Fine Gael with Independent Mick Finn on 6.5 per cent and Fine Gael’s Shane O’Callaghan on 6.4 per cent also in with a shout and Labour’s Laura Harmon on 5 per cent still in with a slim chance. Much will depend on Martin’s surplus and where it goes especially in terms of how much goes to the lower placed runners such as Fianna Fail’s Margaret Kenneally, Una McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens which will affect the sequence of their elimination. Their elimination along with that of Sinn Fein’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid and Anna Daley of Aontu will in turn be critical – is there a chance that all five women might transfer in numbers to the likely last remaining woman in the race, Laura Harmon of Labour ? Time will tell. Diarmuid Ferriter’s surgical evisceration of much of our political class is well worth a read. First triumphant video of the day... it won’t be the last. Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly, who is on track to secure the constituency’s second seat, arrives at the Dublin West count centre. Mr Donnelly received 17% of the first preference votes and is set to exceed the quota on the first count. #GeneralElection2024 pic.twitter.com/YshjN6jBiE Now you know. My best piece of Monk trivial is I used to serve him when I worked in a chipper in the inner city. His order was a regular burger with extra onions (€2.60) Senator Martin Conway (FG) says “it is clear now” that first time Fine Gael general election candidate, Cllr Joe Cooney (FG) will secure a seat for Fine Gael in the four seat Clare constituency, reports Gordon Deegan Speaking at the count centre at Treacy’s West County Hotel in Ennis, Senator Conway said that Cllr Cooney’s election campaign “catured the imagination in Clare”. The north Clare based Senator Conway made his general election prediction as the latest tallies give Cllr Cooney 13 per cent of the vote, lying in second overall place in the tallied vote in Clare. In a strong showing for Government party candidates, they have secured 70 per cent of first preference votes in the tally with three FF candidates securing 37 per cent - more than double the 19.5 per cent share of the vote that the party is predicted to receive nationally by the General Election 2024 Exit Poll. Senator Timmy Dooley (FF) remains out front with 20.5 per cent of the vote and will regain the seat he lost in 2020. Sitting TD, Cathal Crowe’s (FF) tallied percentage vote has increased as the tally has continued with now 10.5 per cent of the vote. Sinn Fein candidate, Cllr Donna McGettigan has a strong shout of securing one of the final seats in Clare with the tally showing that the Shannon woman has 10.9 per cent of the vote. Senator Conway said that party colleague Leonora Carey will be in the shake up for the final seat and the sister of retired TD, Joe Carey (FG) has 8.5 per cent of the vote. Michael Lowry is still the clear favourite to top the poll in Tipperary North with 27.3 per cent of the tallies so far, followed by Alan Kelly who has 15.1per cent, according to Neil Michael. The Labour TD had shown a poor start in early tallies, but he has since overtaken Fianna Fail’s Ryan Meara, who is in third place with 13 per cent. In Tipperary South, Mattie McGrath is still topping the poll, with 25 per cent of tallies, followed by Fine Gael’s Michael Murphy, who has 20.8 per cent. While veteran Seamus Healy had a clear chance at a third place earlier in the day, he has since been overtaken by Fianna Fail’s Imelda Goldsboro, who has 13.4 per cent. of tallies, compared to his 11.6 per cent.. Closely behind Mr Healy is Sinn Fein’s outgoing TD Martin Browne, who has 11.4 per cent.. With all boxes tallied in Dublin Bay South it looks increasingly difficult for the Greens to hold former party leader Eamon Ryan’s seat, writes Marie O’Halloran. On the figures Cllr Hazel Chu is in seventh place on 8.3 per cent in the four-seat constituency. Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan looks set to top the poll on 15.3 per cent with his party colleague Emma Blain in fifth on 10.4 per cent. Labour leader Ivana Bacik is in a comfortable second place on 14.4 per cent with Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan on 13.8 per cent and Sinn Féin’s Chris Andrews on 12.1 per cent. Social Democrats Cllr Eoin Hayes has 9.1 per cent of the vote ahead, 0.8 per cent ahead of Ms Chu. Independent and former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell is on 4.4per cent, dashing her dream of returning as a TD for the constituency. With the health warning that it is the tally, not the full count or any transfers included, it looks like Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin will return TDs to Dublni Bay South. The final tally is in for Galway East reports Cian O’Connell and looking nailed on for seats are Albert Dolan (FF) on 19 per cent and Seán Canney (IND) on 18.4 per cent, though neither look set to be elected on the first count, with a quota of around 10,400 votes required. The battle for the two remaining seats in the constituency is difficult to call. Louis O’Hara (SF) is on 13.7 per cent but may struggle for transfers down the line. Anne Rabbitte (FF) has not polled as well as expected on 7.5 per cent but could recover through transfers after her fellow party member’s impressive, poll-topping performance. Pete Roche (FG) on 9.8 per cent is also in the race, polling ahead of FG’s two other candidates Clodagh Higgins on 6.4 per cent and Niamh Madden on 5 per cent. So too is independent Declan Geraghty, who is currently on 9.5 per cent. Labour may well be on course to win a seat in Cork North Central with Mallow based Cllr Eoghan Kenny on 5,63 per cent and breathing down the neck of outgoing PBPS TD Mick Barry who is on 6 per cent with all 160 boxes tallied, reports Barry Roche. Kenny’s running mate, Cllr John Maher from Mayfield is on 4.54 per cent and could leapfrog Kenny but the combined vote of 10.17 per cent means that Labour must favoured to take a seat at the expense of Barry who may benefit whose two candidates will have almost 6 per cent of votes to distribute. Otherwise sitting TDs, Padraig O’Sullivan of Fianna Fail, Tommy Gould of Sinn Fein and Colm Burke of Fine Gael on our course to hold their seat along with Independent Ireland’s Ken O’Flynn who is on 9.82 per cent of first preferences. With just over half of boxes in the Longford Westmeath constituency counted so far the Fianna Fáil vote is down over 10 per cent on the vote the party received in 2020, reports Stephen Farrell. Four years ago Fianna Fáil received almost ten thousand votes but so far have only garnered 3,451 votes. While this has been reflected in the vote that both Fianna Fáil candidates, Westmeath based Robert Troy and Longford based Joe Flaherty, have received, there are also areas where both candidates have polled well. With 55 per cent of votes counted Senator Micheál Carrigy (FG) is in first position with 15.2 per cent of the vote, followed by his party running mate and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke who is on 14.7 per cent. In third place is Independent candidate Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran on 12.3 per cent, while sitting TD Joe Flaherty is in fourth on 11.1 per cent and Sorca Clarke (SF), also a sitting TD, is in fifth position on 10.7 per cent. Indications so far are that turnout in the constituency has been disappointing, at 50.2 per cent, with a higher turnout in Westmeath. The Longford town area turnout has registered at just 41 per cent so far, while Ballymahon is registering just over 60 per cent. A third of the way through the tallies in Kerry, Michael Healy-Rae is a clear leader in the five seater single constituency, writes Anne Lucy. He has over 23 per cent of the first preference vote, just under a quarter, according to the tally of first preference votes. After him candidates are bunched - Sinn Féin justice spokesman Pa Daly is at 14 per cent; Education Minister Norma Foley (FF) at just under 13 per cent; and Danny Healy-Rae (Ind) is at 12.2 per cent. The real interest here is on an emerging battle between Fine Gael candidate, former footballer Billy O’Shea and Fianna Fáil councillor Michael Cahill - both are on par at 10.8 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively and are likely to fight for the last seat. The third Fianna Fáíl candidate Linda Gordon-Keller is at just 2.7 per cent. Labour’s Mike Kennedy - the party once held two seats in Kerry, most notable was Dick Spring - is at 2.7 per cent; former Fianna Fail TD and now with Independent Ireland Thomas McEllistrim is at 1.2 per cent and Green candidate Cleo Murphy is at 2.6 per cent, a drop of support for her on her second time out. We have some news in from Donegal courtesy of Stephen Maguire. The Fine Gael vote in Donegal has dropped considerably. Tallying is only halfway through but candidates John McNulty and Nikki Bradley are not tallying well enough to be even considered. Barring a miracle, Donegal will be without a Fine Gael TD for the first time since 1937. The tallies for Dublin South West are in and it is not surprise that veteran Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe is topping the poll, says Ronan McGreevy. He is on 14.8 per cent of the first preference vote, but his vote is half what it was in 2020 when he topped the poll with a 29.72 per cent share and a massive 20,077 first preferences. Dublin South West was one of the constituencies where Sinn Féin could have got a second seat had Crowe a running mate. This time he has one in South Dublin County Councillor Niamh Whelan. She has polled 6 per cent of first preference. Combined though the two Sinn Féin candidates are on 21 per cent of the vote, still well down on 2020. Fine Gael’s Colm Brophy on 12.7 per cent and Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart on 12.4 per cent are expected to be re-elected. The last two seats are between five candidates, Labour’s Cllr Ciaran Ahern on 8.7 per cent, outgoing People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy, who is on 7.6 per cent of the first preferences – an improvement from last time out, Fianna Fáil councillor Teresa Costello who is polling very well at 7.1 per cent, Cllr Sarah Barnes, the daughter of former Fine Gael minister Monica Barnes, who is on 6.6 per cent of the first preference vote and also in the mix is the Social Democrats Ross O’Mullane on 5.8 per cent. The big story in the Dublin South West constituency is the collapse in support for Green Party TD Noel Francis Duffy. He has just 2.9 per cent of the first preference vote. In 2020 he achieved 7.34 per cent. He came to prominence in the election campaign when it was revealed that he objected to a housing development in his constituency of 330 homes because they overlooked his kitchen. He claimed that he was not objecting to the development completely, just the bits that contravened the local development plan. Crowe (SF) - 14.8% Brophy (FG) - 12.7% Lahart (FF) - 12.4% Ahern (LAB) - 8.7% Murphy (PBP-S) - 7.6% Costello (FF) - 7.1% Barnes (FG) - 6.5% Whelan (SF) - 6.0% O’Mullane (SD) - 5.8% Edge (IND) - 5.4% Ní Chónaráin (AON) - 3.8% Holohan (IND) - 3.6% Duffy (GP) - 2.9% Mac Oireachtaigh (NP) - 2.1% Hade (IND) - 0.2% O’Keeffe(IND) - 0.2% Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman says he only expects his party to secure between 2-3 seats in the 2024 general election, down from the 12 TDs currently in Gov. “It's clear the Green Party has not had a good day", he told media at Dublin West count centre. Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman has said “it is clear that the Green Party have not had a good day”. Speaking at lunchtime he acknowledged that it is clear a number of his party colleagues will lose their Dáil seats. “Undoubtedly, it is a disappointing result for our party today,” he told reporters. He said it is “hard for a smaller party in Government” and that has “long been the tradition in Ireland”. Social Democrats outgoing TD Gary Gannon, who is looking good for the third seat in Dublin Central, has said the vote for Gerry Hutch is a reflection of how poorly working class communities have been treated for many years. Speaking on RTE Radio he said that “when people are in a dark place they’ll search for very strange options and that’s what happened here. That’s a plague on all of our houses, it’s a reflection of politics as a whole. “For those of us who actually went into the communities and did the work there’s a little bit of a vindication but I think we’ve all got a job to do. Gannon pointed to the “huge level of media” Gerry Hutch received which he said was “disproportionate”. “He had access to one of the most popular podcasts in the country over the course of three episodes, that makes a huge difference.” With 100 per cent of boxes tallied in Dublin North West, Dessie Ellis looks certain to again top the poll with 17 per cent of the 1st preference vote, writes Olivia Kelly. Unlike last time out he is potentially on track to bring in a running mate with former Dublin city councillor Cathleen Carney Boud on 14 per cent. If two seats go to Sinn Féin in this three-seater, that seems to leave the scrap for the last seat between Fianna Fáil’s sitting TD Paul McAuliffe and newcomer Social Democrats Rory Hearn both, also, on 14 per cent of the first preferences. Former Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who lost his seat here in 2020 is behind on 12 per cent. Conor Reddy of People Before Profit/Solidarity who almost got a seat last time out taking the lion’s share of Ellis’s transfers is on 9 per cent, and is likely to suffer from the appearance of Carney Boud on the ballot paper. Independent Gavin Pepper is on 6 per cent, followed by Aontu’s Edward MacManus and Independent Stephen Redmond both on 4 per cent. Former Green Party Lord Mayor Caroline Conroy is on 3 per cent, with Centre Party Ian Croft and Independent Diarmuid Mac Dubhghlais both on 1 per cent. Early tallies in Cavan-Monaghan has Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy nailed on with 20 per cent of the vote. writes Seanin Graham. Almost half of the 260 boxes have been opened and in second place is Fianna Fáil’s Niamh Smyth followed by Fine Gael’s David Maxwell, Aontú's Sarah O’Reilly and Fianna Fáil’s Robbie Gallager. One Sinn Féin source said he is confident that the party’s Pauline Tully will retain a second seat for the party – and possibly gain a third in the republican border county constituency. “We’re going to fasten down two – and it’s too early to dismiss the chance of a third seat,” he said. Last month’s shock departure of Fine Gael minister Heather Humphreys – who held a seat since 2011 - led Sinn Féin to field a late candidate, councillor Cathy Bennett, a theatre manager in Monaghan town. Ossian Smyth is among the senior Green Party figures looking to be in real trouble after all of the boxes were opened in Dún Laoghaire and the tallies completed, reports Emmet Malone. Smyth, a Minister of State in the current government, is reckoned to on just 7.5 per cent, roughly half the first preference vote of Barry Ward who some had seen as potentially a rival for the constituency’s fourth seat. Ward is on 14.9 per cent and should benefit from Jennifer Carroll MacNeill’s projected first count surplus of about 1,000 votes. Another one who was regarded as possibly being destined for the fourth seat dogfight was Cormac Devlin of Fianna Fáil but he has polled well, with the tallies putting him on 15.8 per cent, high enough to ease the party’s concerns about where he might get transfers. As it is, party sources believe he is picking up a healthy number of Fine Gael second preferences in some areas and there would be an expected boost when Aontú Mairéad Tóibín is eliminated. Richie Boyd Barrett is on 12.3 per cent but would be expected to do well from Sinn Féin transfers in the event Shane O’Neill is eliminated but Smyth’s route back from the brink is unclear. He looks to have stayed ahead of Social Democrat, Hugo Mills, but only just and he needs an awful lot of transfers from him and Labour’s Martha Fanning to have a chance of surviving. Cork South West may prove to be a bastion of political stability with all three incumbents looking very likely to retain their seats, according to current tallies with 66 per cent of boxes now open in Mallow GAA grounds, reports Liz Dunphy. Independent Ireland leader Micheal Collins is currently in the lead with 25 per cent of the vote followed by Social Democrat leader Holly Cairns, who gave birth to a baby girl on polling day yesterday. Ms Cairns is in second place to take a seat according to current tallies on 20.1 per cent of the vote. Fianna Fail’s TD Christopher O’Sullivan is coming in to take the third and last seat with 19.2 per cent of the vote according to current tallies. But Fine Gael, between its two candidates Senator Tim Lombard on 9 per cent of the vote and Noel O’Donovan on 12.9 per cent of the vote are currently the county’s leading party with 22 per cent of the total vote, sounding some caution for Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Cairns as these candidates will most likely transfer votes in later rounds to each other. With all boxes now opened and tallied in Dublin Rathdown, Green Party minister Catherine Martin could be in danger of losing her seat, according to Jack White. Fine Gael, meanwhile, look set to retain their two seats, despite Josepha Madigan’s retirement from politics. Minister of State Neale Richmond leads the tally results with 20 per cent, followed by Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell (13 per cent). Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan ended at 12 per cent in the cross-party tally, while independent councillor Michael Fleming and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney find themselves at 9 per cent. Although minimally behind Ms Gibney, the Green Party’s Catherine Martin faces losing her seat at 8 per cent. Sinn Féin’s Shaun Tracey ended at 7 per cent, while former Fine Gael minister and now-independent candidate Alan Shatter ended at 4 per cent, according to the tally results, which noted a turnout of 59 per cent. It appears that Green Party TD Francis Noel Duffy will lose his seat in Dublin South West, writes Ronan McGreevy. The husband of Government minister Catherine Martin has just 2.8 per cent of the vote in the constituency with 82 per cent of the tallies done. He came to prominence in the election campaign when it emerged that he objected to 330 homes in his own constituency which he claimed was overlooking his home. He claimed the development overlooked his kitchen. This is a pretty sobering tweet for the Green Party. If, as looks possible, Greens lose all their Dáil seats, it’s a salutary warning to Labour and Social Dems who will come under fierce pressure to go into government with FF and FG. The Greens did a lot better in this last government than they did previously but to no avail #GE24 All boxes are open in Dublin West and Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly are set to secure the first two seats, reports Sorcha Pollak. With 100 per cent of boxes tallied, Mr Chambers had secured 22 per cent of first preference votes (9,396 votes) followed by Mr Donnelly with 17 per cent of votes (7,631). The estimated quota for the constituency based on the opening of all boxes is 7,281. In a solid third place is Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie who is on track to secure the third vote in the constituency, with 15 per cent of first preference votes (6,663). PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger remains on eight per cent while Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman is holding onto a marginal lead of seven per cent to secure the fifth seat in this constituency. Labour’s John Walsh and Aontú's Ellen Troy’s are holding a joint six per cent of first preference votes. About 57.1 per cent of Dublin West registered voters cast a ballot in this general election, closely mirror national turnout of 56.35 per cent. “It’s really scary at this stage, just watching the boxes being opened,” Cork North West Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan on the tally at Mallow GAA #GE24 ⁦@irishexaminer⁩ pic.twitter.com/CjMI8k3Di3 Ireland First leader Derek Blighe, who is running in Cork North Central, expects Independent Ireland’s Ken O’Flynn to be the main beneficiary when he is eliminated from the poll after polling, according to tallies, approximately 4 per cent of first preferences “I’m happy with how I’m doing so far – I canvassed all over, I did Mallow, I did the northside of the city, Glanmire, Watergrasshill, Glenville, Carrignavar, Whitechurch – I’m only just in but I got a decent amount of support in Mallow and a decent amount of support on the Northside. “The way it’s looking at the moment, I’m not going to make it – I would imagine a lot of votes will go to Ken O’Flynn, some might go to Sinn Fein – after that, I don’t know,” Blighe told The Irish Times at the Nemo Rangers Count Centre in Cork. Pat Leahy has a moment in time assessment of the state of play. In the four-seat Cork East constituency with 25 per cent of the boxes open Fianna Fáil’s Deirdre O’Brien is the early front runner on 13.6 per. cent followed closely by Sinn Féin’s Pat Buckley and independent Mary Linehan Foley both on 11 per cent, writes David Forsythe. Also in the mix are Noel McCarthy (FG) and James O’Connor (FF) both on 10 per cent of the vote. Independent Willie O’Leary, Social Democrats Liam Quaide and Mark Stanton of Fine Gael are all on 9 per cent. With more than a third of boxes open at the Waterford Count, it is clear five candidates are in a battle for four seats, with Sinn Fein led by David Cullinane topping the poll by a decisive margin – and Green Party outgoing TD Marc O Cathasigh unlikely to retain his seat, reports Kevin O’Sullivan. The tallies indicate that if Sinn Fein transfers strongly with Cullinane, based in Waterford City having a big surplus, Cllr Conor McGuinness based in Dungarvan could take a second seat for the party. He is also polling strongly in western parts of the constituency. By mid-morning, Cullinane has 28 per cent of the vote with Sinn Fein at 36 per cent, while outgoing Fianna Fail TD Mary Butler had 17 per cent of the vote and is likely to be re-elected. With 18 per cent of the vote, Senator John Cummins is expected to win back a Fine Gael seat lost in 2020. Its expected outgoing independent TD Matt Shanahan (10.7 per cent) will be in a battle with McGuinness for the final seat. Labour’s Sadhbh O’Neill was at 2.8 per cent and Mary Roche of the Social Democrats at 6 per cent. The sorting of votes is now well underway in Mallow GAA ground where ballots from the three Cork county constituencies are being counted, writes Liz Dunphy Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan said that initial tallies show “a lot of uncertainty” regarding the retention of his seat. “It’s all up in the air. It’s really scary at this stage, just watching those boxes being opened,” he said. “I’ve seen a few snapshots and it’s really tight at this stage.” “Everything” for him is riding on winning a seat, he said. The three constituencies being counted in Mallow are the four seat constituency of Cork East and the three seat constituencies of Cork North West and Cork South West. As expected, with roughly two thirds of boxes tallied in Galway East, outgoing independent TD Seán Canney looks set to comfortably retain his seat having so far accumulated 25 per cent of first preference votes. writes Cian O’Connell. Minister of State Anne Rabbitte (7 per cent) is facing a battle, with fellow Fianna Fáil candidate Albert Dolan (15 per cent) in a strong position. Mr Dolan looks likely to take the second of four seats in the constituency. Fine Gael’s Pete Roche (10 per cent) is currently outperforming his party’s other candidates Niamh Madden (5.5 per cent) and Clodagh Higgins (5.7 per cent). It is still early days, but Mr Roche should benefit from transfers down the line to claim a seat. Sinn Féin’s Louis O’Hara (13 per cent), who narrowly missed out on a shock win in 2020, has started positively. A strong showing in Tuam augurs well for the Athenry native, though he may struggle to compete with rival candidates on transfers. Votes from Athenry are among those yet to be counted, where Mr O’Hara will be hoping for another boost. We have some updated tallies in. First up is Martin Wall. The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Alan Farrell is in a battle to retain his seat in the new constituency of Fingal East. Tally figures suggest that Farrell is slightly behind Ann Graves of Sinn Féin. With all boxes open in Fingal East, tally figures suggested that Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is set to top and poll. Tally figures indicate that O’Brien has received about 23 per cent of the first preference votes. According to the tally figures Farrell is running about 65 votes behind Graves who narrowly lost out on a seat in the local elections earlier this year. Just slightly ahead is out-going TD Duncan Smith of the Labour Party. Tally figures suggest that Graves is on 14.6 per cent, Smith on 14.5 per cent and Farrell on 14.4 per cent. Mick Wallace, who entered the race late on, looks to be out of the running in Wexford. KILDARE SOUTH It's very early doors, but former Sinn Féin TD Patricia Ryan looks to be in serious trouble. With 18pc of boxes tallied, Ryan is polling at less that 1pc. Ryan resigned from Sinn Féin in October 2024.#ge24 @irishtimes Outgoing Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is topping the polls in the Meath East constituency, according to early tallies. Shauna Bowers reports that a total of 25 of 127 boxes have been tallied to date, meaning there are health warnings attached to the indications. McEntee, Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne and Sinn Féin’s Darren O’Rourke are the incumbents in the constituency. The boxes opened to date would geographically favour Ms McEntee and Mr Byrne. As it stands, McEntee has 21 per cent of votes, followed by Byrne at 13 per cent, and O’Rourke close by at 12 per cent. The Sinn Féin candidate was the first elected in the area in the 2020 election. The constituency has seen the number of seats it holds upgraded to four from three, with a number of candidates currently neck and neck to claim the final seat. Both Sinn Féin’s Maria White and Fine Gael’s Sharon Tolan currently stand at 9 per cent, while Fianna Fáil’s Caroline O’Reilly is at 7 per cent. Aontú's Emer Tóibín, the sister of party leader Peadar Tóibín, is at 6 per cent. In total, Fine Gael currently has 29 per cent of votes, followed by Sinn Féin at 22 per cent and Fianna Fáil at 19 per cent. Early days, but here are those leading the tallies for Louth so far, with 26% tallied: Joanna Byrne (SF) 15.30%Ged Nash (LAB) 12.25%Ruairí Ó Murchu (SF) 11.08%Erin McGreehan (FF) 8.98%Paula Butterly (FG) 8.72%Alison Comyn (FF) 8.09%#Election2024 Gino Kenny of People Before Profit looks set for a rollercoaster battle to keep his seat in Dublin Mid West, writes Kitty Holland. With almost all 126 boxes tallied in this five-seat constituency, Sinn Féin’s two TDs here, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are powering ahead on 21.4 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively. Fine Gael’s Emer Higgins is close behind on 9.5 per cent, with Fianna Fáil’s Shane Moynihan on 9.1 per cent. It looks like a battle royale for the fifth seat, between Francis Timmons (Labour) on 5.2 per cent; Eoin Ó Broin (Social Democrats) 6.1 per cent; Gino Kenny on 5.6 per cent and Paul Gogarty (Independent) 6.9 per cent. It appears Kenny’s vote has been squeezed by both the Social Democrats and his neighbour in Clondalkin Glen Moore, running for the Irish Freedom Party, who is on 3.3 per cent. And we have more in from Dublin West where Roderic O’Gorman is in trouble, reports Sorcha Pollak. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly were leading the charge by 11am with 58 per cent of boxes open. Fianna Fáil deputy leader Jack Chambers is currently at 21 per cent, followed by Mr Donnelly at 19 per cent. Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie is at 13 per cent, PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is at 8 per cent with Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman and Labour’s John Walsh Green Party both holding 6 per cent. With a population of 138,547, Dublin West is one of the fastest growing constituencies in the country and has five seats up for grabs in this general election. All the boxes in Dublin Central have now been opened. The tally figures have Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald at 20 per cent, Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe at 17 per cent, Social Democrats Gary Gannon at 13 per cent, Independent Gerard Hutch at 9 per cent, Labour’s Marie Sherlock at 7 per cent, Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick at 7 per cent, Green’s Neasa Hourigan at 6 per cent and Independent Malachy Steenson at 5 per cent. Janice Boylan (SF) and Clare Daly (Ind) and Eoghan Ó Ceannabhain (PBP) all at 4 per cent Sinn Féin is on track for 40-plus seats, Martin Kenny has told Arthur Beesley in Sligo The TD pointed to a “little swing” in the last two days of the campaign which could see the party increasing its Dáil presence from 37. Mr Kenny is on course for a smooth re-election in Sligo-Leitrim, with running mate Chris MacManus in the hunt for a second party seat. “We felt a little swing in the last couple of days. We could feel it coming along. Certainly in the last week the difference was there. We could see it building,” he said in the count centre after tallying Sligo boxes. “We’re going to get probably over the 40 seats nationally – and how many over that, it could be down to transfers for the last seat in a lot of the constituencies. So we’re happy enough from that perspective from what we were last June in a poor enough local election.” The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Alan Farrell is facing a battle to retain his seat in Fingal East, writes Martin Wall. With more 80 per cent of boxes now open, tally figures suggest he is neck and neck with Ann Graves of Sinn Féin. Each have just more than 14 per cent. Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien seems set to top the poll. Former Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, who controversially left the party in October, is polling strongly across the county according to early tallies, as he bids to regain a seat as an Independent. Early indications are that Willie Aird (FG) and Minister of State Seán Fleming (FF) are also performing well. Elaine Mullally (Ind), Maria McCormack (SF) and former FG councillor Aisling Moran (Ind) are also pulling in votes from across the three-seat constituency. Minister of State Ossian Smyth facing a battle to retain his seat in Dún Laoghaire with the Green Party candidate on just over 7.5 per cent, reports Emmet Malone. Fine Gael on about 34 per cent combined with party sources saying Blackrock and Wyvern boxes currently being opened having the potential to boost that slightly. Jennifer Caroll MacNeill currently on course to be elected on first count and they feel if Ward can add a percentage point or two to his 12.7 per cent he would be in a. good position to take the fourth seat. The Taoiseach Simon Harris is on course to top the poll in Wicklow while Fianna Fáil Minister for Health is facing a battle to retain his seat, writes Carl O’Brien. Based on just over a quarter of boxes tallied, Mr Harris is in first place (28 per cent), followed by Sinn Féin’s John Brady (15 per cent) and Social Democrats’ Jennifer Whitmore in third (14 per cent). There looks to be a battle for the final seat in the four-seater constituency between Fine Gael’s Edward Timmins in fourth (6.8 per cent) and Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly (6.6 per cent) in fifth. Joe Behan (Ind) is further behind (4 per cent), followed by sitting Green Party TD Steven Matthews (3.6 per cent), who looks set to lose his seat on what looks like a miserable day for party. Former Fine Gael minister and retiring TD Richard Bruton has expressed his disappointment with media coverage of the election campaign, writes Marie O’Halloran. “I think the headline in one of the newspapers saying Fine Gael was in free fall was a little bit inaccurate to say the least,” he said. The outgoing Dublin Bay North TD said what he saw was “the blowing up of very small errors to dominate the campaign. And whether that is fair or reflective of the issues, I have my doubts.” Mr Bruton said “I think traditional media sort of followed the social media line of the sensational over the substance. “That’s what I felt disappointing about the election- the media coverage was just instantaneous click bait coverage.” On the outcome in Dublin Bay North Mr Bruton said it was still early days but it looked like a seat for Fine Gael, Social Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin with a fight for the fifth seat. He said Denise Smith’s party colleague Cllr Micheál MacDonncha is contention for a second Sinn Féin seat. He is in a battle with Independent Barry Heneghan for the last seat while Labour faces a difficulty in holding on to the seat formerly held by MEP Aodhán Ó Riordáin with Independent John Lyons “not doing as well as people might have hoped for him”. At 9am the Limerick count centre was told that the city count would go ahead despite candidates not appearing in alphabetical order on the ballot paper, writes David Raleigh. As it currently stands, 29 of 137 boxes have been tallied & is showing that three outgoing TDs Willie O’Dea, (FF) is on 20 per cent Kieran O’Donnell (FG) is on 14 per cent and Maurice Quinlivan (SF) is on 12 per cent. On the face of it outgoing Green TD Brian Leddin is struggling on 5 per cent.

It was found in this voting box at Scoil Íosagáin in Moville in Inishowen in the Donegal constituency. Local county councillor Ali Farren of the 100% Redress Party managed to find the owner and a happy reunion was made. With 87 per cent of boxes open in Fingal West, tally figures suggest Green Party Minister of State Joe O’Brien is struggling to retain his seat. Tallies indicate he is on 6.5 per cent in the three-seat constituency. Is Gerard Hutch in with a shout of a seat? With three quarters of the boxes in Dublin Central open, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald is at 21 per cent, reports Sarah Burns. She is followed by Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe at 13 per cent. Independent Gerard Hutch and Social Democrats Gary Gannon are both at 12 per cent. Oh and we have our first wedding ring. It was found in a ballot box in Athlone. With nearly two thirds of boxes tallied in Fingal West, Robert O’Donoghue of the Labour Party seems well in the hunt for a seat, writes Martin Wall. Louise O’Reilly of Sinn Féin is leading on 23.1 per cent of tallies, with O’Donoghue on 18.2 per cent. Grace Boland of Fine Gael is on 15.1 per cent and Lorraine Clifford Lee of Fianna Fáil on 12.4 per cent There are three seats in the new Fingal West constituency. Simon Harris on course to top the poll in Wicklow.Donnelly in trouble? @irishtimes #GE2024 pic.twitter.com/5PMUL2cJzE Early tallies in Wicklow based on 10% of boxes opened show Taoiseach Simon Harris in first place (27%), followed by SF’s John Brady (15%), Social Democrat Jennifer Whitmore (14%), FG Edward Timmins (10%) FF Stephen Donnelly (6%) and Green’s Steven Matthews (3%). @irishtimes #ge24 pic.twitter.com/yNFRTJk2Ze It is very early days but Roderic O’Gorman, the Green Party leader might be in trouble in Dublin West – or at the very least he will be in a fight for the last seat. Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly, the outgoing Minister for Health might also be in a dogfight in Wicklow. A pretty bleak, early assessment from a Green Party stalwart. Suspect today will be a tough day for @greenparty_ie. @rtenews exit polls traditionally over-estimate Green vote-share, and bar 2019/2020 we almost always rely on strong second preferences to get across the line. My hunch is 3 seats #GE2024 Tally from Dublin West with 25% of boxes open - SF Paul Donnelly at 21%, FF's Jack Chambers is at 20%, FG Emer Currie is at 14%, PBP-Solidarty's Ruth Coppinger has 9% and GP Roderic O'Gorman and SD Ellen Murphy are on joint 6%. As part of the exit poll, people were also asked about what they mainly used to help them form their opinion before voting, reports Cormac McQuinn. Twenty-five per cent of respondents said it was TV programmes while the next highest figure, 13 per cent said social media or online messaging. Eleven per cent said online news sites like irishtimes.com, rte.ie or thejournal.ie while another 11 per cent said national radio and a further 11 per cent said local radio. National printed newspapers stood at 4 per cent and local newspapers were on 2 per cent. Podcasts were also on 2 per cent while 18 per cent of respondents said “something else” helped them to form their opinion before voting. According to the exit poll social media was the main form of media helping form the opinions of 18 to 24-year-old voters with 37 per cent of respondents in the age category reporting this. This compares to just 2 per cent among the over 65s and 6 per cent in the 50 to 64 age categories for whom TV programmes were the main response to this question. The poll, which is a joint project of The Irish Times, RTÉ, TG4 and the Political Science Department of Trinity College Dublin, was conducted by Ipsos B&A among 5018 voters as they left 253 polling stations across all 43 constituencies yesterday. Meanwhile, voters were also asked about the trustworthiness of politicians, writes Corman McQuinn. A total of 53 per cent said their view is most politicians are trustworthy. More men (56 per cent) than women (51 per cent) were of this opinion. Forty-five per cent of the respondents said most politicians are untrustworthy. The highest level of trust in politicians was to be found among Green Party supporters with 78 per cent of these saying most politicians are trustworthy. The same answer was given by 73 per cent of Fine Gael voters and 66 per cent of Fianna Fáil supporters. In terms of those who expressed the view that most politicians are untrustworthy, 68 per cent of Aontú voters responded in this way as did 67 per cent of Sinn Féin supporters. More than half of voters, 53 per cent, made up their minds on who they would cast their ballot for in during the election campaign, according to the exit poll. The decision of almost a third came n the last couple of days or on polling day itself. The results demonstrate the importance of the campaign period in Irish elections with many voters yet to make their final decision in the weeks leading up to polling day. The results mirror the 2020 exit poll when 52 per cent of people made up their minds over the course of the campaign. Labour stalwart Kevin Humphreys gives us his hot take @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/T9ciCXYcsd Ballot boxes have been opened across Ireland. Follow the tallies, the exit poll latest and the constituency-by-constituency results as it happens #GE24 #election24 https://t.co/YoSd05lGs6 pic.twitter.com/IY4COxnS2n Gavin Jennings on Morning Ireland has just asked if we “are having a Bobby Ewing in the shower moment”? It’s a fair question for sure give the exit poll and the likely outcome of the election but there won’t be many people under the age of 50 who have any idea what he is talking about. Potentially very interesting story coming out of Dublin West, writes Sorcha Pollak. With 12 per cent of the boxes open FF’s Jack Chambers and SF’s Paul Donnelly are steaming ahead. Chambers is on 22 per cent and Donnelly is on 21 per cent. FG Senator Emer Currie is on 12 per cent, PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is on 9 per cent and Independent candidate Tania Doyle is coming in fifth position at 7 per cent. Leader of the Green Party Roderic O’Gorman is trailing in eighth position with 4 per cent. But – and we can’t stress this enough – it is early days so all the health warnings apply.

Early tallies @IrishTimes #GE2024 pic.twitter.com/kc1f1CBv0w A fresh update from Dublin Bay South, this time from Marie O’Halloran. Tallies predicting in Dublin Bay South that James Geoghegan will top the poll with Labour’s Ivana Bacik in second. Jim O’Callaghan of Fianna Fáil in third with transfers of Social Democrats Cllr Eoin Hayes determining the fourth seat. He is transferring to Ms Bacik and the Greens’s Cllr Hazel Chu. Labour tallyman Kevin Humphreys predicts a tight contest between Sinn Féin’s Chris Andrews and Ms Chu but that Sinn Féin should hold on. It could be that Fine Gael’s Emma Blaine will lose out. Considerable disquiet in Galway West that tally people were not allowed in before the boxes were opened at 9am, writes John Fallon. Former FF Minister Frank Fahey said it’s the first time he has experienced that and fears that it might impact on tally figures. News from Dublin Bay South – two seats for FF looking unlikely although the usual health warnings apply. Dublin Bay South Geoghegan to top the pole, no two seats for FG #GE24 Former Social Democrats leader Róisín Shortall said the party is “certainly very encouraged by the 5.8 per cent” in Friday’s exit poll, writes Marie O’Halloran. “It’s really good and it’s almost double what we had in the last election,” she said. Arriving at the RDS, Ms Shortall said “if that holds up in terms of the actual votes today, we would be very happy and we should certainly make gains”. She declined to put an estimate on those gains. “It’s just there’s so many variables in constituencies. It’s just very hard to predict but we’re very happy with that kind of starting point. almost 6 per cent. It’s great.” News (very, very early news) in from Dublin Central. Gerard The Monk Hutch doing very well in North Strand area of Dub Central. Very early tallies @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/HkNpRWxEmO The political parties, Independents and others are attempting to co-operate on the tallies at the RDS for Dublin counts,” writes Marie O’Halloran. Not the easiest thing in the world however as “everyone has different views on how to do it” says one tally man. The efforts follow hit and miss tallies in the local elections. The ballot boxes are now being opened at the counting has started. We should start getting first round results in the early afternoon. Peadar Tóibín of Aontú was very upbeat and said his party could get up to 4 per cent and might be contention for as many as four seats. “We’re growing and we’ve passed out People Before Profit, Independent Ireland and if the votes go the way I think they’re going we may even pass out the Green Party.” He said a key “objective was State funding. We’ve done all of this growth without State funding and it looks like we’re going to reach the threshold for State funding ” Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also been on radio and he pointed to the “historic decline” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. He said there combined vote would be around 40 per cent, down 3 per cent on 20 years ago. He suggested that two years ago there was “a big momentum behind the idea of a left of centre alternative ... and then it faltered.” Fianna Fáil’s director of elections Jack Chambers has said the election is “too close to call”. Speaking on RTE’s Morning Ireland he denied that there was no difference between his party and Fine Gael and as a result little alternative for voters “We ran different campaigns with different priorities and very much a different platform.” He said the “real story” was the Sinn Féin vote. ' A year or two they were in the mid 30s they’re now back around 20 per cent.” The Green Party’s director of elections Pauline O’Reilly has said that while she doesn’t want to “count chickens before they’ve hatched” she believes the party will be returning to the Dáil with some seats. “It’s only a question now of how many,” she told Morning Ireland. “We benefit from preferences down the line and across the board [and] it’s the preferences down the line that are going to determine this.” Housing and homelessness was the most important issue for 28 per cent of people when deciding how to vote followed by the cost of living on 19 per cent and health on 17 per cent. According to the exit poll, economic stability was on 9 per cent), climate change on 4 per cent and, crime, local transport and roads and childcare all on 2 per cent, writes Pat Leahy Immigration – which had been prominent in the list of issues of public concern for much of the year – played a minor role, nominated by just 6 per cent. The housing issue was more prominent among younger voters with 42 per cent of those under 34 nominating it as the most important issue. We have an update on the exit poll from our Political Editor Pat Leahy that points to what voters may want to happen next. Almost half of voters in yesterday’s general election favour a coalition government based on the combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, according to the Irish Times/RTÉ/TG4/TCD exit poll. Nearly a third of voters (31 per cent) said they would prefer a coalition of just Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil; a further 9 per cent preferred a government of those two parties plus independents; while a further 9 per cent said they would like to see a government of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and one or more smaller parties. Combined, this is a total of 49 per cent of voters in the exit poll who want to see a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-led government. The next most popular choice is a government led by Sinn Féin without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, which was chosen by 22 per cent. Another 7 per cent said they wanted to see a Fianna Fáil-Sinn Féin coalition (including just 9 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters), while 21 per cent said they wanted to see “something else”. The most popular choice for Taoiseach is the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who was the preferred choice of 35 per cent. He pips the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who is on 34 per cent, while the Fine Gael leader Simon Harris is on 27 per cent. Just 5 per cent gave no response. So, how is the day and the weekend going to pan out? The ballot boxes will be opened at the count centres around the country at 9am after which the ballot papers will be sifted and sorted. By 11am some decent tallies will start coming in that should give us an even better sense of where things are going than the exit polls did. By mid to late afternoon we will have the first seats filled and the counting will continue across the country late into the night. It will start all over again on Sunday morning and by midnight tomorrow we should be done. The people have spoken, now we just have to figure out what they said, as the old saying has it. The exit poll we published last night put the three main parties clustered at around 20 per cent and – based on those figures – the next Government will be made up of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and others. But as keen election watchers will well know a lot can change as the votes are counted and the seats get filled. So, we’ll start – unusually, perhaps – by quoting a Letter to the Editor published this morning from Paul Delaney in Delgany. “It’s all over bar the counting: the excuses, the recriminations, the finger-pointing, and the inevitable lengthy political horse-trading that takes place before the establishment of a coalition government. The people have spoken; but it’s going to take quite a while to figure out what exactly they said. ” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Canadian Stocks to Buy Under $10. In this article, we are going to take a look at why Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) is one of the best Canadian stocks to buy under $10. The Canadian stock market had a positive third quarter, following a sluggish start earlier in 2024. The market was driven by domestic rate cuts and rebounding global markets. The BMO S&P 500 Index ETF, iShares Core S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF, and iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ET have surged over 33%, 20%, and 22% year-to-date, as of November 27. If we talk about year-over-year headline inflation, it has cooled as per the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. Hence, policymakers have cut rates four times consecutively and another 50 basis points cut is expected in December. The Bank of Canada’s benchmark lending rate stands at 3.75%, while economists are projecting a terminal interest rate of as low as 2%. The managing director and head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group pointed out that the GST tax break from December 14 to February 15, 2025, will have a high fiscal multiplier, adding a noticeable boost to growth in the first half of 2025. The tax break is to increase consumer spending which has been severely impacted by interest rate increases and high debt levels since 2022. The tax break will allow consumers to buy essentials such as groceries, snacks, and kids’ clothing – all tax-free. In the long run, the potential trade tariffs pose a wider threat to companies. The newly elected U.S. President Trump has vowed to impose a 25% tax on imports from Canada as well as Mexico. In 2023, the U.S. accounted for more than 75% of exports from Canada.

(NYSE:DNN) is one of the largest Uranium mining companies in Canada. The U.S.’s highest uranium import was from Canada in 2023. Moreover, the U.S. has banned uranium imports from Russia, which makes the U.S. find an alternate route for uranium supply. This could be a catalyst for Denison Mines in the coming quarters, however, potential trade tariffs can be a threat to exports. In addition, Denison Mines is creating three uranium exploration joint ventures with Cosa Resources in the eastern part of the Athabasca Basin, northern Saskatchewan. Denison Mines Corp.

The market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips has been dominated by Nvidia, which explains why the semiconductor giant recently delivered another stellar set of results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Oct. 27). One reason why that may be the case is because of Nvidia's expensive valuation and worries that the company's growth trajectory is slowing down. The margin pressure that's going to be created by the quick production ramp-up of Nvidia's new generation of AI chips is probably another reason why the stock has been on shaky ground despite its impressive report.

Title: ‘Superhero stuff’: There’s only one Cian Healy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/30/superhero-stuff-theres-only-one-cian-healy/
Time Published: 2024-11-30T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
As a force of nature, as someone out of the ordinary, Cian Healy was building a reputation long before he even won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup medal with Belvedere College, never mind before he cut his teeth with Leinster and Ireland. Eoin O’Malley was a team-mate on that exceptional Belvo team that in 2005 bridged a 33-year gap by lifting the Cup for the first time since Ollie Campbell captained them in 1972. He had first encountered Healy on opposing mini-rugby teams – O’Malley with Belvedere and Healy with Clontarf. “He was already like this mythical character. People talked about this fellow ‘Cian Healy’ and you can imagine what a giant he was when you’re playing against him at under-10s or whatever,” O’Malley recalled this week, still sounding as much in awe of the child prodigy now as he was then. “He was like a man against boys, and all the stories were going around about him, like pushing his dad’s car up a beach, and he had sandbags at the bottom of the stairs in the house and he’d lift them whenever he was going up and down. It was like superhero stuff hearing about him. “Some of the stories probably grew legs but they’re probably better that way. As a kid, you were running a mile away from him.” Much to the relief of O’Malley and others on the Belvo minis, they would become team-mates at school from the age of 12. “Without really meaning to, he was just on such a different trajectory from day one,” says O’Malley. “Physically he was exceptional but ambition-wise he always talked big. He wasn’t the loudest person but in quietly going about his business, he set a big tone with the group the whole time” Healy, his friends since childhood Paul O’Donohoe, O’Malley and Ian Keatley, were all part of the Belvedere team that surprised a Blackrock team featuring Luke Fitzgerald, Ian Madigan, Niall Morris, Vas Artemiev and Dave Moore by 16-10 in the final. Healy drew a line in the sand when running through Artemiev early on. O’Malley was forced to retire at the age of 25 and admits he fell out of love with the game after two years of ultimately fruitless rehabbing. But on the day Healy is set to become Ireland’s most capped player of all time, O’Malley was planning to travel from Portugal, where he lives with his wife Lara and their three kids Bobby (six), Odette (five) and Lucia (two). O’Malley describes Healy as a shy character and innately very giving, someone who would do anything for his close-knit circle of Clontarf friends and team-mates. “He really has a heart of gold,” says O’Malley, recalling a big freeze 10 years or so ago when Healy offered to drive to the rescue of all and sundry in his jeep. “You can talk about the rugby side of things all day and people see that, but they obviously don’t know him on that level. “If I ask him about a young front-rower coming through he jumps into his protective skin. It’s a new role for him in recent years, like a mentor or big brother, and he enjoys it, and they all seem to have huge respect him.” While dedicated to his profession, Healy has always had an ability not to take rugby too seriously. “He always has an outlet of creativity, whether it’s art or graffiti, or coffee or knife-making,” says O’Malley. “Some are quite obscure, but he always seems to master them. I don’t know what it is, but he has an ability to focus in on a skill and master it.” Healy was always a keen painter and O’Malley recalls him presenting his brother Brian and wife Nina with “an amazing painting that he did himself” from their wedding day. “He’s his own unique character and doesn’t become too pressurised by things, which I think is kind of unique in that world.” Indeed, there is most definitely only one Cian Healy. “He is an exceptional physical specimen,” said Joe Schmidt this week. “A bit like Andrew Porter, both those guys you have to lock them out of the gym as best you can, otherwise they will just become behemoths. One of the things with Cian is that he is so agile. He was so dynamic as a young man when I first got to Leinster. “Probably a memorable moment, we were playing Clermont in a European semi-final to make the final against Ulster and it was in Bordeaux, in France. Clermont were at the height of their powers. We played a set play with Isaac Boss going around the back, the pass from Richardt Strauss going to Rob Kearney; there’s Cian on his shoulder trying to overtake him! “He is that sort of athlete. He was lethal close to the line. The opposition couldn’t stop him, and we couldn’t get the ball off him. He would just grab it, roll his sleeves up and do the work. There are a few others [memories] but I’ll leave those. He can put them in his book.” He is also Leinster’s most capped player and his debut away to Border Reivers way back in May 2007 is the stuff of folklore inside the squad, even in a 31-0 defeat. “He absolutely tore it up,” recalls Jamie Heaslip. “At the video review on the Monday morning we all thought what the f*** is this prop doing?” Of course, Healy has changed as a player and person over 20 years. Heaslip, his long-time friend and roommate with both Leinster and Ireland for a decade, says Healy is deriving additional pleasure from sharing some special moments with his two sons, Beau and Russell, and his wife Laura. His sister Adrienne and parents Don and Caroline, who have attended nearly every one of the 350-plus games Healy has played in his career, will all be in the Aviva on Saturday. Healy and Heaslip are godfathers to one of the other’s children, and Heaslip saw Healy as something of a generational player, who redefined the role of a prop. “Athletically he was as quick as most backs over that first 10 or 20 metres,” said Heaslip. “His explosiveness is insane. You see him in the gym, the metrics he would be doing, his jump scores, his strength, all that, insane power through contact. “Then he had pretty good footwork for a big man. You get the ball to Cian 5m from the line? Good luck trying to stop him,” says Heaslip of a prop who has scored 12 tries for Ireland and 32 for Leinster. “He was a bit of a free spirit and that was embraced in [Michael] Cheika’s environment. We came from different backgrounds and weren’t all out-and-out rugby heads.” When Healy first broke into the team he was into art and rollerblading, and has developed passions for coffee, knife-making and being a DJ among other things, as well as his dogs, Hank (a German Shepherd) and Ted (a pug), and is also, according to Heaslip, “an unbelievable man on the barbecue”. But all the while, what a player, and what a roll of honour. There have been five Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, as well as four Champions Cups, one European Challenge Cup and seven Pro12/14/URC titles, plus that Leinster Schools Senior Cup. On the Wednesday in camp before the Argentinian Test, when Healy would equal O’Driscoll’s record, Andy Farrell hosted an internal tribute night for him, which included a host of personalised video messages. “He deserved all the plaudits he got, because although he’ll have hated it,” says Heaslip, laughing, “he deserved every bit of it, and if he doesn’t go back into rugby after playing, you probably won’t see a lot of him, He’ll follow his other passions and spend time with the kids and doing the family thing. Such is the guy.” Healy’s physical and mental resilience have also been tested to the limits by injuries that might have finished other men, the badly damaged ankle at the outset of the Lions tour in Perth in 2013, the nerve damage following an operation on a disc that severely threatened to end his career and, cruelly again, the knee injury in Ireland’s last World Cup warm-up match against Samoa in Bayonne. Yet he turned his hand to tight head and even as a hooker again. But for this, and Ireland retaining 15 players after both Dan Sheehan and Ronan Kelleher were injured by the 48th minute in Murrayfield, Ireland would probably not have won the Grand Slam two seasons ago. “It’s a game that grinds you down and you’ve got to be on top of all the stuff that people don’t see, in the training grounds but at home as well,” says Heaslip. “He has his own gym at home, a cold pool, a sauna, his recovery boots – he’s all over it 24/7 – as well as being a very hands-on dad in latter years.” And assuming that role as prop mentor is typical of Healy. “That’s testimony to the guy. Loyalty is a big thing to him and being part of something and helping others out. He’s a soft soul but his emotional intelligence is really high. He has an acute sense of what’s the right thing to do for people and the group.” Healy is also good fun to be around and on a night out, even if there’s been less of those in latter years and, accordingly, he is a very popular team-mate. “He’s seen it all, from Leinster pre-success to being part of it, a bit of a lull, success again. He’s one of those guys, like Mal [O’Kelly] was to me, where people will be saying 10 years from now: ‘Oh, I played with Cian Healy’.” Heaslip adds: “He loves rugby, but rugby doesn’t define him. When all is said and done, I hope he stays involved in rugby. I think he’d be an excellent scrummaging coach, similar to John Fogarty. “But at the same time it wouldn’t surprise me if Cian goes: ‘Ah, that was great and now on to life after rugby’ and does whatever he does.” Ireland: 133 caps (currently joint highest with Brian O’Driscoll and 10th highest in world rugby). Debut v Australia, Croke Park, November 2009, 20-20 draw). Leinster: 282 appearances (a record). Debut v Border Reivers, May 2007. Champions Cup appearances: 112 (a record). 5 Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams – 2014, 2015, 2018 (Grand Slam), 2023 (Grand Slam), 2024. 4 Champions Cups – (2008-09, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2017-18). 1 Challenge Cup – (2012-13). 7 Pro12/14/URC titles – (2007-08, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21).

Title: Drinking Fluoridated Water Can Cause More Than 130 Different Health Problems, Peer-Reviewed Science Shows | WLT Report

Full Content:
GreenMedInfo‘s Sayer Ji is calling for an immediate end to all water fluoridation across the United States based on a trove of science he has compiled to show that fluoridated water is highly toxic. Article by Ethan Huff, republished with permission from Naturalnews.com A quick search for the term “fluoride” in the GreenMedInfo science archives pulls up 136 diseases that exposure to fluoridated water can inflict on humans. The first and most referenced health condition caused by fluoride is general fluoride toxicity, which can manifest with a variety of symptoms. One of them is lowered or impaired intelligence quotient (IQ) – fluoride makes people dumb, in other words. Dental fluorosis is another common problem linked to fluoridated water. If you have ever seen someone whose teeth are stained with off-colored spots mixed in with their normal tooth color, that is dental fluorosis. What you are seeing, in fact, is damage to the teeth caused by fluoride chemicals rotting out the enamel, which is ironic considering the claim that drinking water must be fluoridated to protect people’s teeth from decay. “End the outdated practice of fluoridation NOW,” Ji (@sayerjigmi) tweeted alongside a link to GreenMedInfo‘s fluoride science archive. (Related: A New Zealand court recently ruled that even the new lower-level 0.7 mg/L dose of fluoride in drinking water is dangerous, presenting an “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.”) Prenatal exposure to fluoride is also a problem, according to science. Expectant mothers who are exposed to it have an increased risk of bearing children with fluoride toxicity, which includes things like learning disorders, cognitive damage and behavioral problems. Prolonged exposure to fluoride is also linked to infertility in both males and females. Chronic inflammation is part of the cause of this, science shows, with fluoride causing testicular injury in males. Neurodevelopmental disorders can manifest due to exposure to fluoride, as can dental plaque and caries. In older people, neurodegenerative diseases can also manifest due to fluoride exposure. There is also the DNA damage component, goiter, bone fractures, coronary artery ecstasia, osteoarthritis, pancreatic diseases, sleeping disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, spleen damage, hypertension, arterial calcification, lead poisoning, bone diseases, diabetes, pineal gland calcification and iodine deficiency. All sorts of metabolic diseases have been scientifically tied to fluoride exposure, as have cardiovascular conditions like strokes and heart attacks. Chronic kidney disease is another possible health effect of fluoride exposure, as are: • Brain inflammation • Chronic kidney disease (CKD) • Dysbiosis • Ovarian diseases • Anxiety • Cardiomyopathy • Depression • Heart failure • Autism spectrum disorders • Heavy metal toxicity • Premature aging • Low testosterone • Atherosclerosis • Autoimmune diseases • Colitis • Dementia • Estrogen deficiency • Gastrointestinal inflammation • Mineral deficiencies • Obesity • Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) This is just a sampling, by the way, of the many health problems that fluoride exposure can cause. Take some time to look through the GreenMedInfo fluoride science archive to learn more about why you and your family would do best to avoid fluoridated water at all costs. “Adding fluoride to water increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disease in children and reduces their IQ,” warns Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD, Florida’s surgeon general. “We can strengthen teeth without consuming this neurotoxin. The data are consistent, adding fluoride to our communities’ water must stop,” Ladapo added, linking to this guidance for community water fluoridation in the Sunshine State. The medical establishment, including X / Twitter veterans who only believe “the science” as the government defines it, is freaking out that Ladapo, Ji, and many others are speaking out against artificial water fluoridation, which most of the rest of the world rejects as pseudoscience. Artificial water fluoridation is forced drugging by the government. Learn more at Fluoride.news.

RFK, Jr.: “On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water!” This is a true BOMBSHELL if I've ever heard one! Rack up another one for the tin foil hat conspiracy theorists? We sure do seem to be having a lot of "conspiracy theories" coming true all of a sudden, don't we? Despite dentists trying to convince us that we absolutely have to pump fluoride into our water and load it into our toothpaste, the truth is finally coming out! I am really coming to love RFK, Jr. more and more because this is the bombshell announcement he just dropped about finally stopping the poisoning of American citizens with fluoride: On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.

Make America Healthy Again! It's no coincidence this just happened a few weeks ago: Several US Towns Suspend Using Fluoride In Water Supply After Federal Judge Ruling I am also proud to have recently published this next report.... Once again, you can trust us to be AHEAD of the news here at WLT Report: Is It Time For A Nationwide Ban On FLUORIDATED Water? Do community leaders reserve the right to mass medicate every person in their community using the water supply as a vector? What if that medicine was eventually exposed as a POISON decades later? What if that POISON was damaging the brains of children and stunting the cognitive development of the next generation? Article by Lance D. Johnson, republished with permission from Naturalnews.com Since 1945, municipal water supplies have been mass medicated (poisoned) by hydrofluorosilicic acid (fluoride). A byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry, fluoride is captured by industrial scrubbers, and then barreled up and sold unrefined to communities across the country. Today, around 72.7% of U.S. communities are subject to this toxic chemical. But with new evidence coming out against fluoride, is it time for a nationwide ban on fluoridated water? In a landmark decision, a federal court recently ruled that water fluoridation at the current levels poses an “unreasonable risk” to children, markedly reducing IQ and harming their cognitive development. The ruling, issued on September 24, requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take regulatory action in response to the lawsuit filed by the Fluoride Action Network and several other organizations. Back in January 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced plans to lower the recommended fluoride level in drinking water, citing a rise in dental fluorosis cases among children. This condition, caused by excessive fluoride exposure, prompted federal agencies to put limits on fluoride levels in water. In 2015, federal guidelines were finally revised, establishing 0.7 parts per million (ppm) as the standard fluoride level for community water systems. However, according to The National Toxicology Program, even this level of .7 ppm causes health problems in children, harming their cognitive development and lowering their IQ in a dose dependent manner. So why regulate this chemical at all, if the most scientifically-appropriate public health measure is a complete ban on fluoride? Rick North, a former advocate for fluoridation shared his transformative experience after reviewing a 2006 report by the National Academy of Sciences. “I always thought fluoridation was fine,” North said, reflecting on his past beliefs. “But the science contradicted the statements from fluoridation promoters.” Since that turning point, North has dedicated himself to opposing fluoridation, serving as a board member of the Fluoride Action Network. The lawsuit, initiated in 2017, faced numerous delays, as the EPA tried to postpone proceedings to protect the reputations of those who had promoted fluoride for decades. A key moment in the case came with the release of a report from the National Toxicology Program, which indicated a link between fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in children. This report played a crucial role in the judge’s decision, as North noted, “The evidence was compelling.” However, North pointed out that economic interests and professional reputations have played a significant role in the continuation of this practice. The EPA currently has 60 days to respond to the court ruling, but the implications of this decision may resonate far beyond that timeline. As communities weigh the risks associated with fluoridation, the conversation around public health, scientific evidence and regulatory oversight is likely to intensify in the coming months and years. Following the ruling, communities across the U.S. have begun to reevaluate their fluoridation practices. Cities such as Abilene, Texas, and Yorktown, New York, have paused or stopped fluoridation, a move that highlights local autonomy in public health decisions. North emphasized that many communities do not need to wait for the EPA's response, stating, “It’s their decision to fluoridate or not.” While this is true, citizens across the United States should not have to wait for their community officials to weigh the evidence and consider their reputations. If making America healthy again is going to be a serious political movement, then water purity should be top priority. Political leaders should be informing the public that they are being poisoned by fluoride, while petitioning Congress to ban water fluoridation across the United States to protect the welfare of the people.

This may be one of the most important articles I've published in a while... Let me explain why. I'll start at the beginning and I think you'll really get it by the time I hit the end. Ok, so why do we even care about BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street in the first place? And who are they? They are the three largest Asset Managers in the world. Essentially, and this is no exaggeration, they are the people pulling the strings in the background. These are the "Masters of the Universe". Larry Fink runs BlackRock and he is almost certainly more powerful than the President of the United States. That's not an exaggeration, and I'll explain to you why in just a minute. First, let's start here with something called the "Illusion of Choice". Take a look at the image below.... You THINK there are all of these different brands to choose from out there, but they are really owned by TEN big corporations. That's true in food: And it's also true in Media. Same exact thing.... You think there are a bunch of Newspapers, TV channels, radio stations, websites -- but in 2011, SIX corporations controlled 90% of it all. Ok, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Because as bad as that is, here's the part most people don't tell you. It's actually way worse than that because there's another whole layer on the pyramid at the very top that they never tell you about. In fact, I bet most people reading this have never heard of BlackRock, Vanguard or State Street -- or if you've heard about them you probably don't know exactly what they do. Or if you DO know exactly what they do, I bet you may never have realized why it's a giant problem. So let me explain it to you in real simple terms, and I think it will make a lot of sense. Most people are paid every two weeks, usually on a Friday. And most people have been coached to put 6% of their salary into their 401k and/or some other amount up to the employer match. Great, right? Well, here's what's actually happening. Most of those funds go into ETFs and other investment vehicles managed by, you guessed it, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. So they've built a system where millions upon millions of dollars are flowing in to them via YOUR 401k's every two weeks. You bust your butt at work and get a paycheck and you've been coached to give 6% of that check to these "Big 3". The Big 3 then get bigger and bigger and bigger every Friday! What a great system, right? For them it is. And what are you told about it? Almost nothing. In fact, what do they tell you? When you start your job, they tell you to set up your 401k auto-donation and then "forget about it". Isn't that what they say? Don't even think about it! The money will be there for you when you turn 65, but don't think about it until then. And DEFINITELY don't ask who's managing it or what they're doing with it. My friend Patrick Bet-David has been all over this, breaking the story wide open. He was on Joe Rogan last week and he dropped this bombshell.... You think those charts above are bad? That's not even the worst of it. Of the TEN food corporations and SIX media corporations, the control and ownership is actually way more centralized than that. Remember all that money coming in every Friday from YOUR paychecks? That goes to the Big 3, and they use it to own all of those companies. So it's not even the Big 10 Food Companies or the Big 6 Media companies....it's just the Big 3. And of the Big 3 it's really mostly the Big 2. Many believe the Big 2 may eventually take over State Street. For those who like stats, here's the stat for you: 88% of the companies in the S&P 500 has one of the Big 3 as that company's biggest shareholder. PBD breaks it all down here: So...why do I tell you all of that? Because when you centralize ownership and control, bad things start to happen. What starts to happen is the Big 3 and their "affiliates" create things like ESG and DEI scores. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance and it's a score they give to companies to "keep them in line." So is DEI, which stands for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Don't follow enough Far-Left "social" trends -- not promoting enough Trans agenda or LGBTQ agenda or Climate Change agenda (i.e. Bud Light, Target, etc.)? Then your score takes a huge hit! That really explains a lot, doesn't it? Because I can't tell you how many conversations I've been in with people who say: this stuff doesn't make any sense! Why are these companies doing this? Why would Bud Light TANK their company? They know it's not going to play well to the people who buy their beer? THAT. DOESN'T. MAKE. SENSE! And you'd be right to say that, but only if you assume Bud Light is trying to please the people who buy its products. What if Bud Light had a higher master? What if Bud Light was more concerned with its ESG score? What if all the Executives at Bud Light knew that if their ESG score dropped too low, then their #1 Shareholder (the Big 3) would fire them and replace them with someone who would be "ESG Friendly"? What if you're pulling in a total comp package as a top exec in the $20 million range and your choice is to push the Far Left agenda and push LGBTQ or know that you'll be fired and replaced in a year by the Big 3? What do you do? NOW what decision would you make? Now is it suddenly making a lot more sense? And there you have it. Now I think you get it. Now suddenly every single corporation turning their logo to the Rainbow Flag in June suddenly makes a lot of sense. Once again, here is my friend PBD explaining ESG in much more detail: Now let's recap... Do you see how insidious this is? A big chunk of YOUR paycheck goes to prop up the Big 3 every single Friday, they get bigger and stronger, they use that money to buy all the major corporations in the world, and then they force them to do things you would NEVER support. Sick, right? Now let me bring this in for a landing... And here's why I'm telling you about this. Because we don't just report the news here and then say "good luck"! No, we give you solutions! Now back to my Mission and my solution. I figured I would eventually need to build a Parallel-Economy from the ground up. I knew that would be a ton of work. So it was on my back-burner. In fact, it had been there on my back-burner since about 2016. Until suddenly, in January of 2023, I connected with a company I had never heard of before....but they're MASSIVE. They've been in business for over 35 years and they're a VERY pro-American, pro-Liberty, pro-Conservative values company! They're an American based, Made-In-America, warehoused-in-America, shipped-from-America company! In fact, they're the last private, family-owned, pro-American consumer goods company left in America NOT owned by those 11 companies I showed you above. Oh, and what if I told you the products are BETTER and often CHEAPER than what you get from those 11 companies above? Yes, for real. And their founder was once placed on Barack Hussein Obama's list of the Top 10 most "Dangerous Conservatives" in America? (a list I one day hope to make myself!) Once I learned all of that, I knew I no longer had to build this from the ground-up by myself, I simply needed to partner with this awesome company to help them get the word out. So on top of being the last Family-owned major consumer goods manufacturer not part of the Big-11, comparable or often lower prices, supporting American jobs and families, here's the part that ties in to the main point of this article". Non-toxic products! That means no Arsenic, Cadmium, and Lead in their Spices! Which really, if we're being honest, should be the bare minimum for everyone, right? Stunning I even have to tell you that, but I guess I do! But it also means no Red Dye 40 or flouride in the toothpaste or chemicals in the cleaning products, or Deet in the mosquito repellant. What novel concepts, right? Oh, and Black Angus beef, pasture raised on hundreds of thousands of acres. Free roaming with plenty of open air between all the cattle. Grass fed. No hormones and no antibiotics. Never! Oh, and it's CHEAPER than Omaha Steaks! But that's a whole other topic! Sound good to anyone else? Me too! The reason you've never heard of them is because it's Invite Only. I can get you in, but you can't just go sign up. They only want people on the same mission to join and they're happy to say "no" to the Far-Left Libs! They've been doing it for 37 years and it's been working great. Everyone gets a personal, white glove, concierge customer service support to get you access to everything they have. Imagine that! No call centers from India. Just real, friendly, helpful and NICE Americans helping Americans! Wow, like going back in a time-machine. So it is Invite only...and good thing you know someone that has the invites....(me!). If you'd like to find out more and get a FREE personal invite, just go here and tell them Noah sent you: https://SwitchWithNoah.com It's the real deal, and because they don't raise the Black Angus like the big companies do, they may have the SHUT OFF invites if they grow too fast. So if you want in, let me know soon. There's only one pro-American, American made and manufactured, chemical free, toxin free, hormone free, company left....and I'm teaming up with them to FIGHT BACK! Who's with me? Watch this: Time to make the switch..... It's INVITE ONLY, jump on the list here 👉 https://t.co/0HBTcCFOyQ pic.twitter.com/HTbHs1ZW7f — DailyNoah.com (@DailyNoahNews) December 5, 2023 As I said, it's Invite Only and the invite is completely free! In fact, I've assembled a team of patriots who will personally get you invited and signed up....if you want in. Americans Helping Americans. Patriots Helping Patriots. It's called "Patriot Switch" and I think the name says it all. Folks, we don't have many strongholds left. This is one. And I'm all in. If you'd like to find out more and get a FREE personal invite, just go here: https://SwitchWithNoah.com Tell them Noah sent you and I promise you will get a personal call, text or email. Don't freak out when you do. And make sure you tell them you are interested in the Black Angus beef too! I know I tend to get concerned when I get messages from numbers I don't recognize, but if you request a Free Invite (Link here: https://SwitchWithNoah.com) you WILL have someone from my Inner Circle reach out to you....so be ready! These are awesome people and I think you'll love getting a chance to talk with them. And they'll help get you all set up. Who's with me and who's ready to stop eating Arsenic, Cadmium, and Lead? Your friend, - Noah p.s. Since everyone gets personal attention, we will take these in the order in which they come in. So if you are excited, ask for your invite now or you might be far down on the list. I have a great team, but they can only do so much and they'll work on a first-come, first-served basis. Request a free Invite here: https://SwitchWithNoah.com SHARE! Please share your thoughts about this article below. We value your opinions, and would love to see you add to the discussion!

Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, Dave Kearney and Rob Kearney have a minority shareholding alongside Noel Anderson Outside McSorley's were Noel Anderson (2nd from left) and his fellow directors, Sean O’Brien, Jamie Heaslip and Rob Kearney Three Dublin pubs part-owned by former Ireland rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, Dave Kearney and Rob Kearney enjoyed combined post-tax profits of €592,369, despite the Dublin riots “wiping off two weeks of trade”. The four have minority shareholdings in three Dublin pubs – Lemon & Duke, Bridge 1859 and The Blackrock – in a venture with publican Noel Anderson who has a controlling interest in the pub group. Mr Anderson and the former rugby players have expanded their Grand Slam Bars group this year with the reported €5.5m purchase of McSorley's in Ranelagh. Consolidated accounts for the pub group, Pinewood Bars, and subsidiaries show revenues increased by 23pc from €7.64m to €9.39m in the 12 months to the end of February this year. The new accounts show Bridge 1859 located in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 recorded post-tax profits of €178,208 while Lemon & Duke recorded post-tax profits of €213,348. The company that operates The Blackrock, Carysfort Inns Ltd, recorded profits of €200,813. In an interview, Mr Anderson said: “Honestly we've never had to work as hard to make money in our entire lives.” When asked to comment on the pubs’ financial performance in the 12 months to the end of February this year, he said, “all in all, not too bad”. “Obviously, the Dublin riots didn't help. The riots wiped off two weeks of trade at a very busy time of the year.” "We would still be very much encouraging the Government to keep the streets clean and get more gardaí on the streets – it’s not rocket science.” He said transport at night is a major issue for the city that needs to be fixed. "We need more taxis in and out of the city,” he said. The former rugby players serve as directors on the subsidiary firms. Directors this year shared ‘ambassador fees' of €40,000. A breakdown in the Pinewood Bar revenues show the group recorded drink sales of €5.74m, food sales of €3.59m and tea and coffee sales of €44,031. On last year’s financial performance, Mr Anderson said “Bridge: solid. Blackrock: getting to where it needs to be.” “It is challenging with wage demands and price increases,” he said. Numbers employed at the group are now “just shy of 200", according to Mr Anderson. Staff costs last year increased from €3.04m to €3.77m. Mr Anderson said the former rugby players take "an active interest" in the business. “I am not long off the phone with Rob (Kearney) and we are very excited by McSorley's in Ranelagh. We have ambitious plans for it next year. Watch this space. Food will be a big part of what we do there." The combined profits of €592,369 for the three pubs followed aggregate profits of €625,879 for the prior year where a portion of the Lemon & Duke profits were the proceeds of the business interruption insurance payout by FBD that arose from the firm's successful High Court challenge over Covid-19 insurance payouts. A note attached to the Pinewood Bars accounts states the group has entered into a loan arrangement to assist with the purchase of another licensed premises “to the value of €1.3m”. Shareholder funds at Pinewood Bars and subsidiaries at the end of February last totalled €4.75m. Cash funds reduced from €1.4m to €952,221.

Title: Crypto Market: Biggest Movers of November 2024

The cryptocurrency market in November 2024 showcased significant milestones, regulatory shifts, and industry trends. Here are the key takeaways: November 2024 marked a historic moment in the cryptocurrency market, driven by the increasing influence of U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). With inflows reaching $6.2 billion this month alone, these ETFs have significantly transformed Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. The shift from futures-based ETFs to spot ETFs signals greater confidence among institutional investors and provides a regulated, accessible pathway for traditional finance to engage with Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the cryptocurrency’s market price directly, eliminating inefficiencies caused by contango or backwardation in futures markets. The inflow of institutional funds has reshaped Bitcoin’s market dynamics: Source: Santiment Source: Farside Investors Source: Glassnode Bitcoin’s performance in November 2024 reflects the combined impact of macroeconomic forces and on-chain dynamics. With institutional confidence growing and on-chain activity reaching new heights, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency landscape. However, cautious optimism is advised as the market approaches the critical $100,000 milestone. November 2024 has been a month of technical milestones for Bitcoin, with bullish patterns forming on the charts. A key highlight is Bitcoin’s breakout from a multi-month ascending triangle, signaling strong upward momentum. This section analyzes the technical indicators that defined Bitcoin’s trajectory this month and explores potential scenarios for December. Whale accumulation: Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s technical performance in November underscores its bullish trajectory, with strong patterns and indicators supporting further upward movement. While challenges remain at critical resistance levels, the outlook for December remains optimistic, driven by both technical and on-chain factors. Ethereum has maintained its position as a leading blockchain network in November 2024, driven by record-high staking participation, significant contributions to the DeFi sector, and anticipation for its next major upgrade. These developments underscore Ethereum’s resilience and adaptability in a competitive crypto landscape. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) continues to strengthen, with staking metrics reaching new milestones: Source: Dune Analytics Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem, contributing to its robust performance: Source: DefiLlama Ethereum’s development roadmap remains a critical driver of its market sentiment: Ethereum’s price movements mirrored its strong fundamentals: Ethereum’s achievements in November 2024 highlight its leadership in staking, DeFi, and network development. With record-high staking participation, growing Layer 2 adoption, and a major upgrade on the horizon, Ethereum is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the blockchain ecosystem. November 2024 marked a defining moment for Solana (SOL), as it solidified its position as a leading altcoin through groundbreaking performance and ecosystem growth. With its price reaching an all-time high of $264, significant institutional interest, and surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency landscape. Source: DefiLlama Solana’s breakout performance in November 2024 underscores its potential as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. With record highs in price, trading volume, and ecosystem adoption, Solana is poised to redefine its role in the blockchain space. For market participants, aligning with its growth trajectory could yield substantial rewards in the months to come. Donald Trump’s re-election in 2024 has ushered in a pro-crypto agenda aimed at fostering innovation and regulatory clarity. This shift has bolstered the cryptocurrency market, driving institutional participation and expanding the scope of digital asset investment vehicles. A key development has been the wave of spot Bitcoin and Solana ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting the growing interest in regulated crypto products. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto governance is shaping the U.S. cryptocurrency market by fostering innovation, attracting institutional capital, and expanding investment opportunities. The influx of ETF filings, including those for Solana and Bitcoin, highlights the evolving landscape. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, the U.S. is poised to solidify its position as a global leader in digital assets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. In November 2024, AI-focused tokens surged in popularity, driven by partnerships, real-world applications, and increasing institutional interest. These tokens are bridging the gap between blockchain technology and AI, positioning themselves as key players in the Web3 landscape. Risk management: AI tokens are reshaping the Web3 narrative by bringing real-world utility to blockchain technology. As adoption grows across industries, these tokens have the potential to redefine how decentralized ecosystems interact with AI. For traders and investors, the focus should remain on projects with strong partnerships, innovative applications, and a clear regulatory roadmap. Blockchain gaming continues to solidify its role in the Web3 ecosystem, addressing criticisms of prioritizing profits over playability. November 2024 witnessed notable advancements as projects focused on enhancing gameplay experiences, while adoption metrics highlighted the sector’s resilience. This section explores key trends, case studies, and market performance within the blockchain gaming landscape. Blockchain gaming is undergoing a transformative phase, balancing profitability with meaningful player experiences. As projects innovate to address accessibility and retention, the sector’s potential to drive Web3 adoption becomes increasingly apparent. For market participants, staying aligned with evolving player preferences and technological advancements will be crucial. Blockchain is pushing the boundaries of what Play-to-Earn (P2E) models can achieve. In November 2024, AMBCrypto conducted an exclusive survey involving over 5,000 participants, shedding light on key challenges and opportunities in this growing sector. The findings reveal a shift in player priorities, with an increasing emphasis on playability and sustainable ecosystems. The NFT market in November 2024 continued its transformation from a speculation-driven space to one emphasizing real-world utility and innovation. While trading volumes declined by 15% MoM, projects focusing on functional NFTs gained traction, highlighting a shift in market priorities. Source: NFTGo The NFT market in November 2024 reflects a critical pivot toward sustainability and utility. As speculative interest wanes, projects delivering real-world benefits are poised to lead the next phase of growth. For investors and participants, focusing on functional NFTs and cross-chain innovations will be key to staying ahead in this evolving landscape.

Title: All eyes on Amazon Web Services ahead of an AI-heavy re:Invent

UPDATED 10:16 EST / NOVEMBER 29 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof It’s time to get ready for Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, starting Monday in Las Vegas — the biggest cloud computing conference of the year. To prepare, check out our new Special Report: AI and the Cloud, with exclusive features, interviews and analysis, and all the important news starting next week. We take a deep dive into AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation, whose products we’ll hear a lot about at re:Invent, and also analyze the prospects for AI’s hottest new thing, agents, as well as the considerable challenges to their roll-out. That’s also certain to be a hot topic at the event. In addition, theCUBE Research analyst John Furrier interviewed top AWS executives ahead of re:Invent, including CEO Matt Garman, AI and data chief Swami Sivasubramanian, enterprise solutions head Colleen Aubrey, developer experience VP Deepak Singh, and Dilip Kumar, head of Q for Business. We’ll have all the news next week from re:Invent keynotes and interviews, along with analysis from theCUBE Research and interviews on theCUBE. In other news this past week, big money continued to roll into cybersecurity as Halcyon raised $100 million and N-able acquired Adlumin for $266 million. TheCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante assessed his 2024 predictions. ChatGPT gave him an A-, but he gave himself a B. This week saw a mixed bag of earnings reports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but some significant guidance disappointments from Dell, HP, CrowdStrike and Workday weighed on stocks. Meantime, Pony AI’s IPO disappointed as well. Lots of earnings reports are coming next week too, among them Hewlett Packard Enterprise, UiPath, Salesforce and Zscaler. Here’s the news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Check out our newest special report on the intersection of cloud and AI, ahead of AWS’ annual re:Invent conference Dec. 2-6 in Las Vegas. As at just about every tech conference these days, AI will be the star. We’ll have all the news from re:Invent, plus exclusive interviews from theCUBE and analysis from theCUBE Research. First up is our deep dive into Annapurna Labs, Amazon’s accelerator chip operation in Austin, Texas: Amazon’s secretive AI weapon: An exclusive look inside AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation We took a deep dive into the promises and perils of agentic AI, which will be a prime topic at re:Invent — and just about every tech conference after that: Safety and reliability concerns temper agentic AI mania And a closer look at the challenges underneath the hype: AI agents are practical. Reliability is another matter John Furrier also interviewed the exec driving AWS into enterprise applications: Colleen Aubrey: Leading AWS’ bold path into enterprise solutions as well as VP of AI and Data Swami Sivasubramanian: Inside the AI revolution: Swami Sivasubramanian on generative AI, agentic systems and AWS’ vision.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive “critical shock” for the country’s fiscal health. READ NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings The Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years. “The use of AI presents the rare — possibly unique — opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system”. While adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists’ outlook on AI and healthcare is “a mix of enthusiasm and despair”. “Enthusiasm because there’s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. … But there’s friction due to regulation, due to incentives — because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things — and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities”. In other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

This is because the NASDAQ is mostly affiliated with the tech sector. Following the shift, Bank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora has raised the price target for the AI darling from $50 to a street-high of $75 and maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock. Overall PLTR ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Mountain View By James Franey, Charles Gasparino, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been communicating with Donald Trump in recent months through secret back channels, helping the president-elect hammer out a policy agenda before and since his decisive White House victory, The Post has learned. The 68-year-old Wall Street titan — who, like 78-year-old Trump, grew up in Queens in New York City — has acted as “a sounding board” for the incoming commander-in-chief’s economic manifesto , four sources close to Trump’s transition team said. One GOP insider said the president-elect’s inner circle held a series of “no-holds-barred conversations” with Dimon — who at the time was rumored to be eyeing a government job himself. “They have been speaking regularly for months,” said another GOP source briefed on the situation. Three of the sources close to Trump said the secret back channel focused on plans for cutting government spending, banking regulation, taxes and trade. A company insider added that Trump’s top aides set up the calls, which continued after the election, to “create a bit of daylight” between the two men and stop details of the exchanges leaking. Citigroup slashes banker promotions in cost-cutting drive: report A spokesperson for the Trump transition team declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokesman also declined to comment. The quietly cozy relationship between Trump and Dimon has flourished despite the banker’s cryptic and tight-lipped tendencies when it comes to politics. Trump had floated Dimon’s name as a possible Treasury secretary pick in June and later claimed he had won his White House endorsement — despite a lack of any public statement from Dimon to that effect. Trump and Dimon also have continued to talk despite bouts of tension, including on Nov. 14 when the president-elect declared on Truth Social that Dimon ”will not be invited” to join his Cabinet. The banker promptly shot back: “I haven’t had a boss in 25 years and I’m not about ready to start.” The JPMorgan CEO, a registered Democrat who declined to back either candidate in the White House race, had even reportedly toyed with the idea of joining a Kamala Harris administration but then ruled himself out of leaving the Wall Street giant when her poll numbers tanked , The Post previously reported. On Nov. 22, The Post broke the news that Trump was also consulting with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, a major Dem donor, on policy issues. Nevertheless, the former” Apprentice” star’s admiration of Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase for nearly two decades and has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $2.6 billion, was described by one source as “a man crush.” Fat cat Wall Street bankers set for bonus bonanza for first time in three years: study Another individual close to the president-elect said Trump “greatly appreciated” it when Dimon, an avid reader of the New York Post , told CNBC in January the eventual election winner was “kind of right” to criticize illegal immigration and weak defense spending by America’s NATO allies. Dimon’s comments angered left-wingers within the Biden administration who then blacklisted Dimon from the White House in a fit of pique, as The Post exclusively reported. Two weeks ago, the JPMorgan boss said Trump’s threat of slapping tariffs on Uncle Sam’s major trading partners “will bring people to the table” if “done wisely.” Dimon, a vocal critic of current US banking rules, recently slammed the ‘onslaught’ of red tape drafted by Dem-backed regulators, launching a foul-mouthed tirade over a list of his most-hated pieces of legislation at a recent conference in New York, “It’s time to fight back…I’ve had it with this s–t,” Dimon told the stunned audience. The JPMorgan boss singled out regulations aimed at keeping banks resistant to financial storms by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets. The proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER “Things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,” Dimon said on Oct. 28. Dimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million last year, urged the US government in his annual letter to shareholders last May to deliver “effective policy-making” issuing a warning that “a politician’s dream is a businessman’s nightmare.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said Trump’s second term as president will present “the biggest inflection point for banking regulation in three decades.” “This is Jamie’s vindication,” Mayo told The Post. “He is looking at all the bureaucracy and red tape and saying enough of the regulatory theater. It’s like banking with one hand tied behind your back” Mayo added that Trump potentially taking an ax to stringent banking rules “should mean borrowers get better rates for their loans and better services for customers.” The top analyst said: “It would be foolhardy for any administration not to hear Jamie Dimon out. Everyone should at least be consulting him for ideas.” The revelations that Trump has sought advice from a “kitchen cabinet” of Wall Street bigwigs comes after his appointment of staunch loyalist and hedge fund mogul Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. He has been hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach building his team for his new administration. Trump’s move to seek informal counsel from titans of American finance, who are outside his MAGA inner circle, could provide further reassurance to investors ahead of his second term in the White House that kicks off on Jan. 20.

Russian President Vladimir Putin took the opportunity to praise “smart and experienced” Donald Trump, but warned the president-elect was “not safe” in a press conference Thursday at a security summit in Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan. Though describing Trump as “clever,” Putin used examples of previous attempts on Trump’s life and his treatment by opponents as reason to be cautious. Notably, Trump was wounded during an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. “What struck me the most is not that Donald Trump was faced with uncivilized means—including assassination attempts—more than once," Putin said, according to a translation from the Associated Press .

A top analyst who accurately called the end of the 2022 crypto bull market thinks Ethereum (ETH) is poised to rally in both its Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) and US dollar pairs. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 826,200 followers on the social media platform X that ETH/BTC looks good after respecting its support at 0.30 BTC. According to the crypto strategist, ETH/BTC may bounce to as high as 0.4597 BTC. “Very promising start. Let’s see if we can get to the target.” At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0373 BTC worth $3,563. As for Ethereum against the dollar, Pentoshi thinks it is within the realm of possibility for ETH to surge above $4,000. “No reason this doesn’t challenge this year’s highs, or higher in my opinion. Which likely has confluence with the ETH/BTC target posted.” He also thinks that the rally will be driven by investors allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in capital to ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Starting to become more consistent for ETH. We could see a few $250-$500 million days at some point too in the near future for this [BlackRock ETH] ETF. Had a $91 million day just in the last week. Probability of that you have to assume is very high and not far stretched at all.” Pentoshi is also keeping a close watch on the native asset of the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network Render (RENDER). The analyst says RENDER looks bullish after flipping a key resistance level at $8.10 as support. “Was a very short wait, RENDER flipped it, retested, and confirmed on the four-hour [chart]. Structurally a great looking chart.” At time of writing, RENDER is worth $8.61, up over 8% in the past day.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023. Compared to the dollar, it has reached lows not seen since mid-March 2022. It's currently trading at 108.1 rubles per USD.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Does one want a “chastened” NATO either? For whom egos could well be strategic assets? Rump Ukraine > Occupied Rump Ukraine. Who cares how they decorate? If they get testy, Russia just goes Grozny and rewilds Galicia. The next generation of Russian soldiers could use a boogeyman that isn’t actually dropping bombs on them at bedtime, also cold war economy go brrrrtttt. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them! The picture was most probably generated. Even the HTTP link looks like a prompt: “a-butterfly-with-orange-and-black-wings-on-a-beige-background”. Looks like a photo of a gift shop trinket. If you follow the “via” link, it states quite clearly that it is a 3d render, i.e. a drawing done on a computer. A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada. And if there is any, it is always post mortem… Israeli scorpion gotta 🦂 https://x.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1862397943195562124 https://thecradle.co/articles-id/27889 That article says that Hezbollah are waiting for the Lebanese army to deploy but the army itself has no illusions what the Israelis are all about. Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? Because they have a letter of marque. A Freedom of Anchoring exercise? Not a Coastie, but there are various authorities for boarding. See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Is there any evidence for that belief? “Xi sits in Beijing. In Moscow, Putin. In Washington, Trump is on the way. You can call them crazy guys. They don’t want good. Hope lies with von der Leyen in Brussels.” Absurd and offensive.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

That’s a danger, baby, bathwater. But here’s a start: : Left/Right is historically accurate, since the Left was where the Third Estate sat during the National Assembly, and it was dominated by lawyers, not workers. What was, now is. : Taleb: Never use terms such as progressive or conservative without reference to a rate of change Progressive and conservative are ill defined terms, verbalistic labels. It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power. That’s a word Fazi doesn’t hone in on. Rather applicable to the tremendous wealth inequality of an oligarchy. Thanks.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based. On checking novel’s origin , some stats in storyline: Set in mid 1999-New Years day 2000, World population ~7B (seemingly indicative of extreme overpopulation!) and NYC 34M. Food shortage driven by resource hoarding by rich is a major factor in social upheaval . Euthanasia becomes a protein source… Never gonna Happen! Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from.

Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions. By Stephen Castle [ Seemingly explaining why Labour has shown no legislative interest in strengthening the public health service. No wonder why Jeremy Corbyn had to be expelled from Labour. ] It seems that rational people with increasingly painful, progressive and handicapping chronic illnesses which are not in themselves terminal will still be forced to commit suicide without the support of friends or family. Seems that Parliament is addicted to short measure The British legislation may be a first step. In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday. The support is greatest among those over 55. re: Oreshnik orbital weapon as explained by the villain in “G.I.

I guess they never venture out themselves to see the first of the Xmas displays being set up around labor day and the store being fully overwhelmed with yuletide expressions right around halloween. There is no longer a black Friday but rather, a black November. If the supposed holiday seasons’ sales are less than than stellar, retail has no one to blame but themselves as they have cannibalize the season with an uber-long ramp up. https://www.axios.com/2024/11/27/americans-consumer-spending-holiday-season This is more than a panic reaction. It seems my government is really committed to WW3: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/abandoning-ukraine-infinitely-higher-costs-head-of-mi6 When a minimizer of the ongoing Pandemic is worried about H5N1, that is a sight to behold. A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

Title: Andy Farrell hoping Ireland have kept their best performance until last against Australia

Whether the provinces see it this way or not is a moot point, but Ireland are in bonus territory this weekend with the addition of a fourth Autumn Nations Series game against Australia, or at any rate it will be very much a bonus if they keep their best performance until last against Joe Schmidt’s team. That is what Andy Farrell most wants before heading off on his sabbatical with the British & Irish Lions. “Our best performance of the autumn and maybe more, hopefully,” said the Irish head coach after announcing a side which sees the return of Hugo Keenan, James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park, Ronan Kelleher and James Ryan, as well as the retention of Sam Prendergast at outhalf. “That’s what you’re always wishing for, isn’t it, to progress? Australia are certainly progressing. We feel that the occasion, the importance of it, everything that we put on, trying to kick on in any type of series, is enough for us to see the best of ourselves.” Farrell loves maximising landmarks and there’ll be no shortage of them on Saturday at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm), what with Cian Healy reaching the Irish record of 134 caps off the bench and this game part of the IRFU’s 150th anniversary celebrations. “It’s huge, it’s a huge privilege for us all. We’ve Ollie Campbell coming in this evening (Thursday) presenting the one-off jerseys we’re going to use. They’re beautiful jerseys, aren’t they? Very nice,” added Farrell dutifully of the retro commemorative jerseys which went on sale this week and will be worn against the Wallabies. Campbell is the perfect fit, not only as a top bloke and great player, but he captained the Belvedere College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1972, while Healy was part of the 2005 Belvedere team which beat Blackrock to bridge a 33-year gap. “It’s a privilege for us because we talk about our history a lot in this type of position when it comes around on our shift. The 150th anniversary is a special place for us, and then you combine it with what’s happening there with Cian. “What a story, playing his debut 15 years ago against Australia,” said Farrell in reference to Healy’s debut in a 20-20 draw against Australia at Croke Park in November 2009. “It’s fitting for both the union and for Cian and his family. So (it is) a privileged-type situation for us all to be involved.” While the return of five frontliners was significant the retention of the 21-year-old Prendergast for a second successive start is the headline selection ahead of Jack Crowley, who has to be content with a return to the bench after starting all nine post-World Cup Tests prior to last week’s win over Fiji. Gus McCarthy has been preferred on the bench to Rob Herring, as is Craig Casey ahead of Conor Murray, while Peter O’Mahony and Garry Ringrose return to complete the ‘23′. While Prendergast’s selection was perhaps a less risky punt in the final game of a November window, Farrell saw this as a decision based on merit in the here and now. “This isn’t just throwing someone in and hoping to get the best out of it. I think he’s deserved it a little bit but also there’s obviously an eye on (the future). I suppose with the two young lads, this game won’t define them. It’ll be a good part of their development, and that’s what you’re hoping for.” Though one suspects both men are probably a tad weary of the narrative and line of questioning, Farrell said he welcomed the storyline of Schmidt returning to these shores for the first time as an opposing head coach. Praising what Schmidt achieved with Leinster and Ireland as “phenomenal”, Farrell added: “He’s the most successful coach in Irish rugby when you look at his time overall in Dublin. We’ve got a lot to thank him about, and I think it’s a nice story that we get to celebrate this game alongside him.” Farrell thanked Schmidt and David Nucifora for first hiring him as defence coach after the 2016 Six Nations and for the “privilege” of working with him. He also admitted that Schmidt’s “DNA was all over” the All Blacks’ World Cup quarter-final win when their assistant coach. “We’ve been here a little bit before, but when he comes back to these shores he should be celebrated for everything that he’s done for Irish rugby.” Farrell also spoke of cementing the foundations left by Schmidt and adding to them. “Whatever is good we keep cultivating that and keep allowing that to grow, and then I suppose you deal with things in a way that’s true to yourself, the direction of the game that you want to play, and the personnel that you’ve got to play it.” Farrell will miss next year’s Six Nations as well as a three-game summer tour to Georgia, Portugal and one more, but has compartmentalised both roles. “The only thing that drives me on is planning for the future of this team and that’s only been at the forefront of my mind, certainly over the last six months anyway.” Regardless of the result against Australia, Ireland will still be seeking to become the first country to win three Six Nations’ titles in a row next year, and Farrell understandably believes that passing the baton to Simon Easterby will ensure the smoothest transition. “We’ve been working together long enough now to agree on how this team needs to be driven forward. All our ideas over the years, that will continue. Simon is unbelievably diligent and the right man for the role in leading from the front. We’ve had the experience there and we’ve seen the credentials there, and we know it’s going to be a seamless one.” Ireland: Hugo Keenan; Mack Hansen, Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki, James Lowe; Sam Prendergast, Jamison Gibson-Park; Andrew Porter, Rónan Kelleher, Finlay Bealham, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris. Replacements: Gus McCarthy, Cian Healy, Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Peter O’Mahony, Craig Casey, Jack Crowley, Garry Ringrose. Australia: T Wright, A Kellaway, J Suaalii, L Ikitau, M Jorgensen; N Lolesio, J Gordon; J Slipper, B Paenga-Amosa, T Tupou; N Frost, J Williams; R Valetini, F McReight, H Wilson (capt).

Bitcoin has surpassed the 2015-2018 cycle, sparking more discussion about the potential for $100K. Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past a critical price milestone — surpassing key resistance levels that previously defined its cyclical behavior during the 2015-2018 bull market. This latest breakout highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing maturity in a market that has evolved significantly since its early speculative days. Unlike the dramatic peaks and valleys of the 2015-2018 cycle, Bitcoin’s current trajectory appears more measured, underpinned by stronger fundamentals and broader adoption. With its price now exceeding levels that many believed would act as insurmountable resistance, questions arise about whether this surge marks the beginning of a new bull cycle — or even a run toward a six-figure valuation. Bitcoin’s current cycle is progressing faster than its 2015-2018 counterpart. After peaking at $20,000 in 2017, Bitcoin took nearly three years to recover, consolidating at lower levels before its next bull run. In contrast, the 2022 bottom has been followed by a much quicker rebound, with Bitcoin surpassing $50,000 within two years — nearly a year faster than the previous recovery. Source: TradingView The chart shows Bitcoin maintaining momentum, with monthly RSI readings above 75 signaling strong bullish conditions. Trading volumes have also exceeded those from the earlier cycle, reflecting increased market participation. This milestone represents an 80% recovery from 2022 lows, supported by long-term holder accumulation and reduced exchange balances. These on-chain shifts highlight stronger fundamentals compared to prior cycles, suggesting less speculative activity and more sustained growth. Bitcoin’s accelerated recovery sets it apart from historical patterns. Two key factors define this cycle: institutional adoption and macroeconomic tailwinds. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pushing for Bitcoin ETFs, signaling mainstream acceptance and driving capital inflows. Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures has surged, reflecting heightened institutional activity. On the macroeconomic front, persistent inflation, geopolitical instability, and de-dollarization trends are bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge. Additionally, advancements like the Lightning Network have improved scalability, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility. These dynamics, absent in earlier cycles, are fueling stronger and more sustainable demand, positioning Bitcoin as a maturing asset in both retail and institutional markets. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s recent price movement, coupled with strong on-chain fundamentals, makes $100K a real possibility. Bitcoin surged past $90K in November, with a notable increase in trading volume and RSI hitting 75, suggesting robust bullish momentum. The correction that followed has seen Bitcoin hold steady around $95K, maintaining a healthy RSI of 65, indicating that the market is not yet overbought. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The ongoing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation concerns and growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, further support the bullish outlook. With supply constraints post-halving, Bitcoin’s path to $100K remains credible, though broader market volatility could still introduce risks.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Government on the hook for $115m, Nicola Willis seeks urgent advice

Time Published: 2024-11-28T23:19:18Z
Full Content:
Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The Government has $115 million at risk from the collapse of SolarZero. Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she was seeking urgent advice on the SolarZero situation. She had no further comment. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Société Générale. This morning, NZGF said: “A total of $365m from all lenders was available, but this was not fully drawn down at the point of SolarZero’s liquidation - and some had been repaid. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract. It quoted $177 for a four-person household. United States private equity giant BlackRock bought SolarZero from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price was not disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. At the time it went into liquidation, it had 15,000 customers (which it framed as 40% of NZ solar installations) and 160 staff. The debt facilities organised by NZGIF were designed to “allow SolarZero’s residential solar portfolio to increase to 20,000+ owner-occupied homes”. Meanwhile, a SolarZero staffer, who confirmed his identity and role to the Herald, says he asked management for figures on the amount owing to staff. He said 160 staff were told they had been terminated at a 4pm meeting on Tuesday, with no notice period or holiday pay offered. He said he had been told by a member of SolarZero’s executive team that about $1.4m was owing in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000. “Some of them are small operators and this could cause them to fold.” He described the sums involved - about $3.7m - as “chump change for a company like BlackRock”. He was planning to join a staff protest outside BlackRock’s Auckland office this afternoon - although he said he had fears for the turnout, given a number of those involved were on work visas. He said they feared being caught on camera by Immigration. The Herald put the staffer’s numbers to one of the liquidators, who did not immediately respond. The liquidators - Stephen Keen and Russell Moore of Grant Thornton - earlier indicated they would not comment until their first report, which is expected within five working days. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” NZGIF said in a statement on Tuesday that “NZGIF was informed today that SolarZero’s sole shareholder BlackRock has placed the company into voluntary liquidation”. This morning it added in a statement: “The liquidator’s initial report is due in the next few days. However, it may take some time to understand the final financial implications under a range of scenarios”. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

November 28, 2024 17:15 ET | Source: Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Limited (the “Manager”), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the “Funds”), is announcing its intention to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (“ESG”) factors associated with MINF and MDIV by revising the names, investment objectives and strategies of the Funds. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category. Special meetings of unitholders of the Funds will be held on or about January 30, 2025, at which unitholders of record as at December 23, 2024 will be asked to approve the revisions. Further details of the meeting, including the proposed changes to the investment objectives and strategies, will be provided in an information circular to be distributed to unitholders of the Funds in advance of the special meeting. If approved, changes will be reflected in the Prospectus renewal filing of the Funds, which is expected to occur in late March 2025.

Source: Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Limited (the Manager), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the Funds), is announcing its intention to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (ESG) factors associated with MINF and MDIV by revising the names, investment objectives and strategies of the Funds. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT), JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category. Special meetings of unitholders of the Funds will be held on or about January 30, 2025, at which unitholders of record as at December 23, 2024 will be asked to approve the revisions. Further details of the meeting, including the proposed changes to the investment objectives and strategies, will be provided in an information circular to be distributed to unitholders of the Funds in advance of the special meeting. If approved, changes will be reflected in the Prospectus renewal filing of the Funds, which is expected to occur in late March 2025.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Uber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Over the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology. AI systems in these vehicles process data from LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to navigate roads, identify objects, and make decisions in real time.

Per the analyst, Vishay, a semiconductor manufacturing firm, was the hidden winner of the focus. The analyst further added that Vishay had secured better-than-expected orders for NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers and RTX 50 series graphics cards.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Been ‘Consistently Bullish on Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI)’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's List of 7 Energy Stocks for the Trump Trade. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) stands against the other energy stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his views on the future of the natural gas and oil sectors under President-elect Donald Trump's administration, alongside a majority Republican Congress. Cramer expressed his belief that companies involved in the natural gas ecosystem will thrive as a result of this new political landscape. He pointed out that the United States is rich in natural gas resources, which can be produced cheaply. While some may believe the country’s position in terms of natural gas production is lower than expected, Cramer noted that, due to the Biden administration’s unfriendly stance toward fossil fuels and a weaker global economy, the natural gas industry had underperformed for much of the year. However, Cramer is optimistic that this trend will soon shift. He emphasized that although the U.S. has vast natural gas reserves, there has been a lack of infrastructure to effectively transport the resource, a problem exacerbated by the Biden administration's resistance to new pipelines. This, according to Cramer, has hindered the industry. He specifically criticized the pause on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export authorizations, calling it a stunning setback for one of the country’s strongest sectors, which provides thousands of high-paying jobs. He went on to say: “The betting is that Trump's going to undo that on day one, giving new life to all these LNG projects that really have been stuck in limbo.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 13 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight Since the election, natural gas prices have surged more than 70%, although Cramer noted that this increase was partly driven by a cold snap after a warm fall and the delayed start to winter. “Seasonally, this is a good time for the commodity but I also think there’s some optimism about the future of the industry driving this move.” Cramer then shared his broader outlook, saying: “But here's the bottom line: We’re hearing about all sorts of Trump trades right now, and many of these things have made insane moves in less than three weeks, to the point where, actually, they’re feeling precarious to me.” He went on to recommend natural gas as a more sustainable investment, emphasizing that while many sectors have already surged in the wake of the election, natural gas stands out as an industry with long-term potential. Cramer believes that with the incoming administration’s supportive stance toward the fossil fuel sector, the natural gas ecosystem will continue to thrive for years to come. He suggested that investors should look to buy into producers, pipeline companies, and LNG export stocks, all of which he believes have further upside potential now that the regulatory environment has shifted. “I bet they keep running for the next couple of years, not months. They have all moved but they're nowhere versus where they could go now that Biden's anti-fossil fuel team has been broomed for one that is totally supportive of this industry.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during a recent episode of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of an oil and gas pipeline, spanning vast landscapes. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Cramer suggested that pipelines could be a strong investment for those anticipating a natural gas boom under Trump, including Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI), “Other than the producers, what works if you're betting on a natural gas renaissance under Trump… How about a pure play on pipelines? Much easier to build these under a Republican administration. There are plenty of good options here. I've been consistently bullish on Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan, they yield 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively.” Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is an energy infrastructure company, focusing on the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, petroleum products, and other commodities, along with CO2 production and related facilities. The company operates one of the largest natural gas transmission networks in the United States, holding an interest in or managing approximately 79,000 miles of pipelines and 139 terminals. It also oversees 702 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas storage capacity and generates about 6.1 Bcf of renewable natural gas annually, with another 0.8 Bcf in development. Additionally, the company transports more than 40% of the country’s natural gas production. The company has a strong project pipeline, with a backlog valued at $5.1 billion. According to Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) management, there are considerable growth opportunities in natural gas, particularly in areas such as LNG exports, cross-border exports to Mexico, power generation, and industrial demand. The company is currently involved in discussions about power opportunities that could exceed 5 Bcf a day, and its internal projections suggest an overall growth of approximately 25 Bcf a day in the natural gas market over the next five years. Overall KMI ranks 3rd on Jim Cramer's list of energy stocks for the Trump trade. While we acknowledge the potential of KMI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The good news here, this company does make money.” On Nov. 18, Symbotic reported quarterly earnings of five cents per ...

After all, Huang's company is arguably the most important player in the AI world right now. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for powering large-scale AI models. It's always a good time to buy dividend stocks, but when the market is volatile, it's even more important. There has been global macroeconomic volatility as high inflation persists in some regions, and President-elect Donald Trump's financial agenda could spark change in the U.S. economy. What that means, of course, is that you want to have some solid, reliable dividend stocks in your portfolio. Despite being a net seller of stocks to the tune of $166 billion over the last eight quarters, there are two premier stocks the Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying. Down by 92% since its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2021, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) highlights the risks of buying a stock too early. When it hit public markets in 2021, Rivian was the second most valuable U.S. automaker in the world, behind Tesla. With a market cap of over $100 billion, it dwarfed rivals like Ford Motor Company and General Motors despite reporting barely any revenue. In the closing of the recent trading day, Tilray Brands, Inc. (TLRY) stood at $1.37, denoting a +0.74% change from the preceding trading day. Sign in to access your portfolio

Power needs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are expanding so rapidly that some data center campuses may use more electricity than entire cities, or even states, CNBC reports. Here is what Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers had to say about technology companies: "Technology companies are in a “race of a lifetime to global dominance” in artificial intelligence. It’s frankly about national security and economic security. They’re going to keep spending because there’s no more profitable place to deploy capital”. READ NOW: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News As such, it is important to note that renewable energy isn’t going to be enough to meet their power needs. According to developers, natural gas will also have to play a role. In turn, this need will slow down the progress towards meeting carbon dioxide emission targets. Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure, and power resources for such facilities, further reveals how data center companies have already begun operating at a scale where they have started “tapping out against the existing utility infrastructure”. In other news, Uber is reportedly building a fleet of gig workers for labeling data for AI models. The new data labeling division, known as Scaled Solutions, will have workers complete projects for the company's internal business units as well as serve outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to a report from Bloomberg.

Title: Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Fund Achieves 131,000% Lifetime Return

Time Published: 2024-11-28T15:16:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has revealed in a new post that its Patnera Bitcoin Fund’s lifetime return has recently topped 131,000% net of fees and expenses after the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged to near $100,000 after the US elections. In the post, Pantera Capital’s CEO Dan Morehead shared an email forecasting back in July 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at $65, that the “bitcoin washout happened” and predicting the price of the cryptocurrency would surge over time. The email notes he was going to “buy 30,000 bitcoins” with his own personal money at a time in which the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $740 million. Given the small size of the cryptocurrency market at the time, Morehead noted that in 2013-15, the fund “bought 2% of the world’s bitcoins.” To Morehead, buying Bitcoin at the time was like “buying gold in 1000 B.C.” as then “99% of the financial wealth has yet to address bitcoin.” He noted that the industry has made progress and now believes 95% of the financial wealth “has yet to put their full-sized position on.” The CEO added that the catalyst for the figure to keep on dropping has “just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States” at a time in which massive “institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. “ As a result, he predicted the price of Bitcoin will move to $740,000 per coin, up from its current level around $95,000. The surge would see Bitcoin’s total market capitalization hit $15 trillion, which to Morehead isn’t an inconceivable number relative to the $500 trillion in financial assets. Per his words if Bitcoin’s price growth were to continue it would hit the $740,000 mark in April 2028. Featured image via Unsplash.

Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital — the first crypto fund in the United States — is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin could smash $700,000 in 2028, roughly a week after the flagship crypto rocketed toward a six-digit price. Despite Bitcoin’s astronomical growth in recent months, Morehead thinks it’s “still early” for BTC and that the cryptocurrency’s bull market has yet to run. Dan Morehead noted in a Nov. 26 blog post that 5% of financial wealth is now exposed to Bitcoin. Yet, that figure is set to increase with more regulatory clarity in the U.S. as pro-blockchain president-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House. This would result in faster institutionalization of Bitcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started a “massive transformation,” posited Morehead. “It’s [Bitcoin] already done three orders of magnitude,” Morehead wrote. He revealed that his investment company’s crypto-focused Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which was launched in 2013, has notched an over 131,000% lifetime return on its first Bitcoin purchase at $7. “Another one seems plausible.” Per the Pantera CEO, Bitcoin has been on a trendline that will push its value to roughly $740,000 by April 2028 (a nearly 670% growth from the current price point) if it continues its growth pattern. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was trading for about 2.3% higher at around $95,294 at publication time. “I just can’t help thinking that we still have many more years of very compelling returns.” $740,000 is “not an inconceivable number, relative to $500 trillion in financial assets,” he explained. At this price, Bitcoin would boast a market capitalization of a whopping $15 trillion. “I can imagine an investor thinking: ‘Bitcoin has doubled this year. Well, I guess I missed it,’” Morehead said. “That’s the wrong mindset.” Furthermore, Morehead told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Nov. 27 that he doesn’t think Bitcoin could ever crash to zero now as it has reached “escape velocity” with 300 million investors around the world owning it.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI news updates that Wall Street is monitoring. AI companies in the United States, many of whom have extensive business relations in China, are waiting anxiously for President-elect Donald Trump to assume office and announce possible changes to American policies towards China that will provide greater clarity on future US trade with the Asian country. Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing. Latest reports from news platform Axios contend that Donald Trump is considering the appointment of an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Per the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.

Status: Brought to market in April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €3.6 million. It was sold in September for €3.2 million, according to the Property Price Register (PPR). Architectural gems are my thing, and houses right beside the sea would also (imaginary budget allowing) most definitely be my thing. The Lake House in Howth is a place of absolute wonder, hemmed between its own lake and the endless stretch of Burrow Beach, which overlooks Ireland’s Eye. The back garden is knitted into the dunes, with specific decks on which to enjoy a tipple of your choice. It also has an outdoor terrace at the end of the extensive living area that faced west to catch sunsets; the roof of the terrace was carved in the shape of a keel, to honour the owner’s legacy of sailing. Inside, the living areas are well considered, with a long sittingroom graduating into a Snaidero kitchen. The house splits into two levels, with a study set between them on the landing. The views from The Lake House over the sea were staggering, and it was clear that the previous owner had loved every minute of living there. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: Listed in June 2024 at €1.75 million through Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes & Sherry FitzGerald Radford. Achieved in excess of its asking price, according to selling agent John Radford. It appears on the Property Price Register as having sold for €1.35 million in October 2024, which accounts for the house on one acre. The remainder of land, almost 27 acres, was sold separately. Situated along Wexford’s historic Norman Way, this Georgian residence dates all the way back to 1801. Though described on the National Built Heritage website as “a farmhouse”, the five-bedroom pile extends to a considerable 483sq m (5,198sq ft). Lying on almost 30 acres, the grounds have two paddocks, four stables and a hay barn likely to have attracted those who wish to entertain equestrian pursuits. In addition to its pristine condition, as owners who had lived there since 1997 had restored it fully to its former glory, there is a restored coach house, offering a large livingroom and games room. Add to this a 13m swimming pool and its proximity to a number of beaches and golf courses, along with access to fresh fish at nearby Kilmore Quay, and you can understand why it was on the market for such a short time. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: On the market through Sherry FitzGerald Catherine O’Reilly since October, seeking €695,000. Lynam Cottage has been my favourite house reviewed by The Irish Times this year, not just for its postcard-perfect exterior, light-filled interior and stunning surroundings, but for the fact that it introduced me to the story of its namesake – the author, journalist, linguist and administrator Joan (Shevawn) Lynam. Elizabeth Birdthistle’s research into Lynam, who bought and refurbished the cottage in the 1960s, painted a portrait of a fascinating woman who worked for Alfred Hitchcock, worked and wrote for various media outlets, and who was passionate about Basque independence and found herself banned from Spain for a time because of it. She put her knowledge of the region into a novel, The Spirit and the Clay, which she set during the Spanish Civil War. Lynam wrote her second book, Humanity Dick – a biography of eccentric TD Richard Martin – no doubt surrounded by the rolling Wicklow hills at the cottage. And today, following a thorough renovation by its current owners, Lynam Cottage is an idyllic retreat – the envy of writers and artists alike. It also incorporates some of my favourite interior features, such as a checkerboard floor at its entrance, skylights in the living areas and a window seat overlooking the countryside. Read our full review here. – Jessica Doyle Status: Brought to the market by Sherry FitzGerald seeking €10 million in September, and went sale-agreed that month, according to the selling agent. The selling price has yet to be confirmed, and it has yet to appear on the Property Price Register. Hidden away down a long driveway off Sandycove Avenue East, this very private period home on three-quarters of an acre of gardens that run down to the sea is a few minutes’ walk from the Forty Foot and Joyce Tower. The 594sq m (6,394sq ft) five-bedroom villa-style detached house, built in 1840, was effectively rebuilt and completely modernised over the past 24 years. Inside, it’s all bright, modern and warm (it has a B3 Ber), with rooms opening on to terraces that look over the formal gardens to the sea. A separate two-storey studio mews is accessed from Sandycove Lane. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: On the market with Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since September, seeking €3.8 million. It may seem obvious to choose a very large period property in Rathmines as the home that stood out for me in 2024, but it wasn’t the sheer size of it or the Dublin 6 address that impressed me most, it was how the house was lived in. This six-bedroom home, measuring 410sq m (4,413sq ft), is set out over three floors, with every corner in use. For the last 22 years it has worked around family life, so there were no rooms that were kept out of bounds for visitors’ eyes only. The ground-floor level adapted to every stage, from toddlers to teenagers. The reception rooms are both refined and relaxed, with the shuttered sash windows facing out to Brookfield Tennis Club. And the beauty of it all is that number 5 has not lost an ounce of its period charm along the way. Here’s hoping it goes to another family that will fill each room with life and love. Read our full review here. – Alison Gill Status: Came to the market with Knight Frank in September seeking €2.1 million. Property is still on the market, but under offer. This semidetached end-terrace house was one of three Regency-style houses inspired by the developer Gerry Walsh’s love of the musical Oliver! and the famous Who Will Buy scene, set at a Regency terrace in Bath. To him, it symbolised beauty and harmony, and he sought to recreate homes with the same style and flair, taking years to assemble plots of land until he could build the terrace. Every corner, every space, every window and door was drawn and redrawn up to 200 times, and the meticulous attention to detail means every room, lobby and hallway works. The garden received the same exigent level of oversight, with each limestone slab on the patio individually chosen, pleached pear trees, and every bit of outside hardware, such as the downpipes, are of the highest quality. Walsh installed a Snaidero kitchen not just on the ground level, which has an open-plan kitchen, living and dining area and a pretty sittingroom to the front, but also in the utility room in the basement, along with a gym and home cinema. I particularly love the elegance of the stairs and its long mahogany banister running continuously over the house’s three floors. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: On sale through Knight Frank since October, seeking €7.75 million. Imagine the perfect weekend: your best friends are in Dublin to watch Ireland beat the All Blacks at the Aviva Stadium in Ballsbridge. After the match you repair to Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip’s pub The Bridge 1859 for a few celebratory scoops, followed by a steak dinner in Roly’s Bistro. Then it’s all back to your new abode at number 23 Elgin Road, where the party really gets started. This four-bed Victorian home in the heart of Dublin’s embassy belt, and done up to the nines by interior designer Jane Gilloway, is the perfect place for entertaining guests in style. You can put your friends and their families up in two luxury bedroom suites in the side extension, and in the two substantial detached modern mews houses at the end of the back garden. Gilloway has added plenty of showstopping touches to the elegant period home, including antique cast-iron radiators, Jacobean stained-timber floors and, in the kitchen/breakfastroom, Paonazzo honed marble worktops. With a spacious media room, pool table, fully equipped bar, wine room and integrated sound system, it offers all the ingredients for a marvellous party – and a luxurious lifestyle. Read our full review here. – Kevin Courtney Status: Brought to market by Sherry FitzGerald in June seeking €2.45 million. It went sale-agreed for over the asking price in August, says Michael Grehan of Sherry FitzGerald. An end-of-terrace Victorian five-bed with a pale pink exterior in an enclave of otherwise mostly redbrick homes off Rock Road, opposite Blackrock College, was at various times a school “for the education of young ladies”, a Protestant boarding house and also the home of a famous Irish bell-maker. It sold relatively quickly – overlooking Blackrock Park, the Dart line and the sea, its location was likely a strong selling point. Built in 1844, but Georgian in style, with bow windows and nearly floor-to-ceiling multi-paned new sash windows, Montereau had been modernised, with smart new bathrooms and kitchen – but there was still room to revamp the basement and a garage beside the house. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: Brought to the market in February 2024 with an asking price of €1.75 million. It was later listed at €1.5 million for auction, where it sold for €1.675 million according to selling agent Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty. This lovely two-storey, four-bay 260sq m (2,800sq ft) Victorian structure dates from 1895 and lies along one of the quietest roads in Sutton. It retains some unusual decorative embellishments of Indian accent, such as it ogee-headed arches to the veranda, as described on Fingal County Council’s record of protected structures. While its architectural origins have been lost to the annals of time, its Indian connection was presumed to be due to the fact that its first resident was a Dutch sea captain, with links to the Dutch East Indies and the East India Trading Company. And, although it would benefit from some upgrading, it has spectacular details such as elaborate window mouldings and striking cornicing. But what impressed most was its location, overlooking the sea with super views from rooms to the front. In addition, its southwesterly aspect allows for spectacular sunsets from these rooms, as the property is angled to maximise its expanse of views across Dublin Bay. It had been home to the Beshoff fish and chip family since 1978, until it sold earlier this year. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: For sale through Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since August, seeking €7.5 million. If you want to be lord of the manor in your own big estate, you usually have to head out to the countryside, but Tinnahinch is a classic country pile transplanted into the south Dublin suburb of Foxrock. This expansive Georgian-style home is built to the highest standards, with period features including Flemish bond facade, Portland stone sills and bespoke oak joinery. There’s a grand entrance hall and gallery landing, richly appointed reception rooms, spacious kitchen/diningroom and luxurious bedrooms. What really completes the idyllic picture is the 1.7 acres of lush gardens landscaped in the style of 19th-century Irish gardener William Robinson, who pioneered the move away from formal gardens to a wilder, more naturalistic style. The gardens are a magical mix of native and exotic plants, with winding paths, wooden bridges, tumbling waterfalls and serene lily ponds, with numerous spots to relax, read a book or dine al fresco.

Title: Crypto Oversight May Shift To CFTC Under Trump Administration: Report
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-oversight-may-shift-to-cftc-under-trump-administration-report/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T04:30:29Z
Full Content:
According to a report by Fox Business, citing sources familiar with the matter, the incoming Donald Trump administration may empower the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to regulate certain crypto assets. With nearly two months remaining before Trump assumes the US presidency, the incoming Republican administration is already making strides toward fulfilling campaign promises, including creating a favorable regulatory framework for digital assets. The Trump administration is expected to significantly expand the CFTC’s role in overseeing the $3 trillion digital assets industry. This move could potentially scale back the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often faced criticism for stifling the growth of the digital asset sector by classifying most cryptocurrencies – apart from Bitcoin (BTC) – as securities. The SEC’s controversial “regulation-by-enforcement” approach has made the agency unpopular among US crypto industry participants. With the Biden administration ending, pro-crypto Trump’s incoming presidency signals a possible shift in Washington’s stance on digital assets. A recent ruling from a Texas court dealt a blow to the SEC by overturning its contentious broker-dealer rule. Sources suggest that the CFTC’s expanded role may include regulating digital asset exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies classified as commodities, such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, commenting on the matter, said: With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency. It is worth highlighting that Giancarlo is being considered for the nebulous “crypto czar” position under the Trump administration. According to the report, the new role is expected to “help execute crypto policy and potentially oversee an industry-led advisory council.” Beyond issues like immigration and trade tariffs, Trump’s campaign also focused on positioning the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” To support this vision, the president-elect is appointing regulators with moderate to positive views on digital assets. Asset managers like Bitwise and WisdomTree are optimistic that renewed interest in the digital asset industry could lead to the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for virtual assets such as XRP and Solana (SOL). Recent reports suggest that Trump’s transition team may create a national Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to tackle inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties. The idea has gained support from asset managers like BlackRock. Interestingly, similar efforts are underway globally. Brazilian federal deputy Eros Biondini recently introduced a bill to establish a national BTC reserve, aimed at diversifying the country’s treasury holdings. BTC trades at $94,784 at press time, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock in preliminary deal to buy private credit group HPS for $12 bln- FT

Full Content:
Investing.com-- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) has entered a preliminary deal to buy HPS Investment Partners as the world’s largest asset manager looks to further grow its scope, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. BlackRock has a “handshake deal” with the firm, FT reported, with general terms of the deal to be announced after the Thanksgiving Holiday. A final price will be around $12 billion. HPS was considering an initial public offering that would have valued the firm at around $10 billion. The firm is one of the biggest private credit managers on Wall Street, and was founded by former Goldman Sachs employees in 2007. Wednesday’s report comes after BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion buyout of Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this year, the company had acquired UK data firm Preqin for around $3.2 billion. The asset manager is seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing private credit sector, given that alternative assets offer much more lucrative fees than traditional markets.

Posted on 11/27/2024 3:24:51 PM PST by george76 Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and Vanguard Group, three of the largest institutional investors in the world, for conspiring to artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices. Over several years, the three asset managers acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States, thereby gaining the power to control the policies of the coal companies. Using their combined influence over the coal market, the investment cartel collectively announced in 2021 their commitment to weaponize their shares to pressure the coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals. To achieve this, the investment companies pushed to reduce coal output by more than half by 2030. Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street utilized the Climate Action 100 and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative to signal their mutual intent to reduce the output of thermal coal, which predictably increased the cost of electricity for Americans across the United States. These firms also deceived thousands of investors who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits. Yet these funds pursued ESG strategies notwithstanding the defendants’ representations to the contrary. Deliberately and artificially constricting supply increased prices and enabled the investment companies to produce extraordinary revenue gains. This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” A coalition of 10 other States joined Attorney General Paxton on the lawsuit. The Buzbee Law Firm and Cooper & Kirk are serving as outside counsel.

This conspiracy violated multiple federal laws that prevent a major shareholder, or a group of shareholders, from using their shares to lessen competition or engaging in other anticompetitive schemes. Further, the companies broke Texas antitrust and deceptive trade practices laws. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” said Attorney General Paxton. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.

Crypto isn’t in the depths of a bear market, and your cousin doesn’t think you’re a crook anymore. Now crypto is ascending again—and everyone wants financial advice, just like Thanksgiving from three years ago. Below is a compiled list of handy talking points for your crypto-curious relatives, covering the industry’s most significant, recent developments. Stick to the facts, avoid shilling meme coins to the elderly, and you’ll be cruising to pie in no time. Bitcoin came within a few hundred bucks of the vaunted $100,000 milestone last week, and while the price has retreated a bit recently, it returned above $97,000 earlier Wednesday. What’s driving the demand that’s pushed Bitcoin’s price record in recent weeks? Institutional and retail investors have expressed optimism that there will soon be a more favorable regulatory climate for digital assets in the U.S. That’s thanks to the victory of self-proclaimed crypto enthusiast Donald Trump, along with the election of the most pro-crypto Congress to date. Meanwhile, institutional investors’ forays into spot Bitcoin ETFs have also given traders reason to be optimistic, pumping up the price of Bitcoin over the year. In short, Bitcoin is more “legit” than ever in the eyes of Wall Street and politicians. Your folks may have heard that BlackRock and Fidelity—which may be managing their pensions—are now involved in Bitcoin. What are these two Wall Street giants doing with crypto? Well, you can explain: They swallowed the orange pill. OK, so you probably don’t need to use Crypto Twitter jargon. Still, you can tell them that traditional finance bigwigs now offer exposure to the two largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Thanks to long-awaited SEC approvals this year, top fund managers who manage different ETFs now let ordinary investors buy shares that track the price of the two via brokerage accounts. Even your technophobic aunt can down the orange pill with a couple of taps on her phone. On the campaign trail this year, Trump made lots of promises about lots of things, including crypto. And while it remains to be seen whether he will live up to many of those commitments, signals are already indicating that he may be holding up the crypto end of the bargain—which could be a massive development for the industry. First things first: last week, the president-elect nominated Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary. Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has indicated he’d back Trump’s proposal to establish a Bitcoin federal reserve. The plan would see the U.S. buy billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to diversify its reserves. Think of it this way: If your uncle says Bitcoin has no real value, you might soon be able to tell him the U.S. government backs the asset. Pair that with Trump’s plans to unwind the SEC’s aggressive crypto crackdown completely, plus his oath to get the Republican-controlled House and Senate to approve laws that would firmly legalize most crypto activity swiftly, and it’s no wonder crypto has exploded in recent weeks. Experts say the market still has much, much higher to climb in the coming months, too. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, now has a role in Trump’s government: The Tesla CEO will lead the Department of Governmental Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) with billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to supposedly clear up the bureaucracy. What’s that got to do with crypto, though? Well, the new department’s acronym matches the ticker of Dogecoin, the original and most meme coin. That’s probably not a coincidence. Elon Musk has for years spoken—and tweeted—about how it’s his favorite coin. This earned him the “Dogefather” title on Twitter, now called X, after he acquired the platform. While we can’t be 100% sure of the naming origins, Trump is selling a DOGE-themed t-shirt featuring himself, Musk, and a Shiba Inu—the mascot of Dogecoin. Don’t want to decide between Bitcoin or Ethereum? If you’d instead launch your own token, you can now do it much more efficiently than ever. One of the most significant innovations from the most recent crypto cycle has been the creation of token launchpads, or platforms that allow anyone to near-instantly create a token with a few clicks and for a few cents worth of crypto. The most notable launchpad, Pump.fun, a Solana-based platform, has given rise to some of the most memorable tokens from this cycle. Nearly four million tokens have been created on Pump.fun this year, ranging from animal tokens that have provided early traders with significant riches to those launched by crypto-curious celebrities like musician Iggy Azalea. Crypto’s adoption barriers keep getting knocked down. Consumers now have a wide breadth of mobile app options to buy, sell, and interact with a variety of platforms. Plus, the rise in smart wallets, which drastically simplify the onboarding process, is making it easier to get those previously intimidated by the technical complexities of crypto to participate on-chain. With the launch of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, those looking to gain crypto exposure have more traditional financial options. That option didn’t exist in the U.S. last Thanksgiving. Are you looking to dive head-first into crypto? Not so fast—you’ll first want to get your sea legs. The crypto industry is rife with scams, and a seemingly innocuous link to an airdrop could lead you to a wallet drainer: Say goodbye to all your coins! Even if you manage to keep your crypto out of scammers' grips, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to keep your holdings from going to zero. Not many people make money trading crypto, and much fewer are getting rich off of it. Up to 80% of day traders lose money over time, according to a report published in The Journal of Finance. It’s still incredibly easy to lose your shirt in crypto, whether by clicking a malicious link or betting on highly volatile coins. For newcomers, you’re probably best suited to sticking to the most significant coins via apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, Cash App, or buying into ETFs. Want to go deeper? Be very careful—you’ll be thankful in the long run.
